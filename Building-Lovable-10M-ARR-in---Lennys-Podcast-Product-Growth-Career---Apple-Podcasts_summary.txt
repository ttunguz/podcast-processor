2. KEY INSIGHTS
Insight 1: Levellable enables the 99% of people who don't write code to turn ideas into real products and businesses.

- This empowers more entrepreneurship and innovation by providing an AI software engineer for anyone.

Insight 2: Figuring out what to build and assessing if the product solves the actual user problem is becoming more important than engineering.   
- "If I'm putting it together a product today, I would be really obsessed about getting as many skills as possible for each person I hire."
- As AI takes over more of the building, discovery, ideation and taste/craft to ensure the right thing is built will be key product skills.

Insight 3: The team's obsession with the product, users, and working together productively is driving Levellable's fast growth.
- "People love the product. That's the driver of the growth."

- "It takes a lot to master using tools like Levellable and being very curious and patient...is the best way to be productive."
- Being extremely specific about what you want, what's working/not working is key vs. just saying "it doesn't work."

- "The best thing you can do for your current profession, or if you want to have a new job, is to be in the top 1% in knowing how to use AI tools."
- Spending a week using AI to solve an end-to-end problem can get you to the top 1% globally in AI skills.

3. TECHNOLOGY & PRODUCT DEVELOPMENTS
Key technical/product innovations:
- Levellable allows visually editing the generated app instantly without code, a differentiator vs. alternatives 
- Solved key scaling challenges to enable apps to be built reliably without getting stuck
- Upcoming: custom domains, team collaboration, ability to import existing code bases into Levellable

5. TEAM & CULTURE SIGNALS
Leadership philosophy and approach:  
- Inspiring an extremely ambitious, user-obsessed, fast-moving culture is key in a region where that mindset is less common
- "Sees that this is like the time in human history when you have the most impact per worked hour. And that's why we have to be super ambitious."

Team building strategies:
- Look for people who have done something they deeply cared about before and can reason through unorthodox problems 
- Almost always have candidates join a work trial for at least a day, sometimes a week
- Hire for raw cognitive capabilities, bias for speed vs. process, thinking like an owner of the whole business vs. narrow specialization

Company values and priorities:
- Extreme ambition and urgency ("AGI timelines approaching")
- Obsession with the product, users, and team productivity 
- Everyone able to work across disciplines while being world-class in at least one  
- Bias for speed and learning vs. rigid planning

6. KEY METRICS & BUSINESS DETAILS
Growth, revenue and user metrics:
- $4M ARR in first 4 weeks, $10M ARR in first 2 months with 15 people
- Crossed $1M ARR per week within 3 months of launch  
- 300K MAUs, 30K paying users as of February 2023
- Continuing to grow faster than $1M/week

Go-to-market insights:
- Primarily grown through organic word of mouth and building in public on social media
- Planning to help creators using Levellable get more users through paid ads, SEO tips, referrals

7. NOTABLE TECHNOLOGIES 
Novel technical approaches:
- Identified key areas where AI gets stuck building apps (login, data persistence, Stripe integration) and resolved those bottlenecks
- Pushing the bounds of AI "agency" to take higher-level instructions and autonomously handle steps like writing tests, fixing bugs

8. COMPANIES MENTIONED
GitHub: "Once we started creating 15,000 projects per day, so there were a lot of usage, then some engineer maybe woke up in the night and they saw their servers were taking too much load because of us, so then they shut off down completely."
- Levellable was creating 15k new GitHub projects per day for each user, prompting GitHub to temporarily shut them down

Surge: "Once we launched that, that was 21st of November. We just hit like one million in an era in a week and then in kept going and growing at that pace. It's still growing at even faster than that pace."
- Levellable hit $1M ARR one week after launching on Surge, a rapid development platform, and grew from there

9. PEOPLE MENTIONED
Fabian [Co-founder of Levellable]: "I grabbed a previous colleague of mine who has also been a founder, Fabian, and I said, we should build something like GPT engineer but it has to be for the people who don't write code."
