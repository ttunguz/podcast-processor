process of I was there for like a few months left to get my visa and I'm
grateful for the visa process to get done and then flying back so I live in
near San Jose which is about an hour and a half south of the city yeah no I
stayed meet up yeah hundred percent I stay in H Street like in the hot every
near today yeah are you grateful dead fan am I what are you a grateful dead
fan no I'm not I started on hate-naspberries
interesting I didn't know that I still got to learn a lot of my U.S. history like
I feel like a baby in the U.S. I don't know much about history like and the
culture and I don't know they are baseball vendors well and every week I
used to see like the trains crowded with baseball no more about our our history
than I know about your history so yeah
anyway I've started the recording everybody welcome to my broadcast this is
our fourth episode we've got Yovan on and he's the founder of jigsaw jigsaw
stack calm so Jay real quick introduce yourself and then we'll let Yovan take
over and give his 10 minutes not 10 yeah 10 thousand foot speech then we can
get into your app and all that okay I'm Jay Shukla doing this fun little podcast
with Anthony we're both into startups and hustling businesses and we'd like to
know we'd love to hear more about what's going on with jigsaw yovan so please go
ahead and give us a quick introduction about jigsaw rupper said hey guys you
have been here so jigsaw stack we focus on building really really small models
that can run really fast across the world so that people can plug these
models into different parts of the attack in easy cheap and fast way without
having to you know spin up understand how the model works or I think today if
we look in the AI world it's so messy and so difficult for most engineers to get
started this hundred one ways to do something right we just want to make
that super simple and be like that center spot for you to just get started
with different AI tools plugged into your back end or your front end yeah so
you have like an SDK where we can integrate from our code exactly we start
with the jigsaw the jar master SDK and the Python SDK that you can plug in play
but at the end of the day it's an API so you could just fetch it from any framework
or any website that you want to yeah that's awesome I was well I first got
introduced to you from eric who runs dailypings.com and yet mentioned you
are an advertiser and Jane I were looking at your you're offering because we're
you know we're pretty up to speed on the latest trends and tech and all that he's
more a hardware guy but I've been a software engineer in Silicon Valley for
30 years and you know let's say I should it's just it's it's it's completely
changing how it is I'm doing I'm using cursor well I was using cursor now I
switched to windsurf and I'm using windsurfing.
Windsurf what's that? It's another competitor cursor. Okay let's get out.
15 bucks a month instead of 20 it's still it's still pretty good I think it's
better than cursor actually okay but yeah I mean I don't even write code
anymore. AI doesn't all for me you have to act like an architect now right yeah
you know if you treat AI like you're an intern asking to build you an app and
not giving like any technical details you're gonna get a bunch of garbage but
if you can narrow it down very specific I found very specific short concise
changes committed by the way yeah when that features Don start a new chat
because I want hallucinate. I find after about two hours it starts I love that
you brought it up because hallucination is one of the biggest pain points that
we are trying to solve I think we have solved to an extent I think one of the
biggest use case for AI right now is code completion or human in the loop
code completion right like what you're talking about very small precise ways of
getting code generated in different parts of your code base it's great if
you're doing a lot of front-end applications or applications that can
have you there all the time to kind of like be the guy that makes the decision
does this code make sense or not but when it comes to back-end use cases for
example using OpenAI to do OCR on passport information in a consistent
manner or having translation that you can validate that you know that open
GPD for one break those are things that get really scary right to use in the
real application because hallucination at least such a big part in breaking those
things and that's why one of the things that we focus in our models it's very
specialized models it's not hyper generic stuff so if you launch an OCR
model it's very much fine-tuned trained to prevent hallucination when it comes
to OCR applications or translation for the translation model so you're actually
training your own models we are we are so we get our own data sets we train the
models to be very specific so that you can use it in back-end operations that
run yeah where you doing training on like Amazon Web Services DCR Microsoft
yeah so AWS we use all of them because a bunch of them gives us credit so we
try to use one when we're done with that credit we go to the next one and but we
mostly use it on AWS nowadays and I don't know if you heard of this company
called base then we train on DR in four eyes well which under the hood is AWS as
well but it just they make it a lot easier to train what's it called base
then base base what 10 10 like 10 number 10 or base 10 okay yeah I think I've
seen it briefly I haven't used it though when you go down quantization levels
like FP 24 16 yeah usability do you see like a do you see a lot of do you see a
lot of issues at lower FP levels what kind of stuff do you know the reason I'm
asking you said that's being a hardware guy I'm chiefly interested in stuff like
that and 100% I think like lower FP levels are definitely viable in some in
some use cases you know so if you're making really small models if you have
FP4 makes sense no really small model they could stay in a cell phone for
example 100% now that that's one of the most recent topic that we've been
exploring quite a bit because we are launching a embedding model as a service
and the pain point is most embedding models objective is to be really quick
they typically run on the CPU they should run very fast but if you look at
like the new realm of embedding models they mostly run on GPUs which then cost
a lot right like you do not want an embedding model be running there so then
then we'd look into content how do we quantize these models into F 16 F 24
make them a lot smaller run them on the edge in different CPU networks so what
we realized is that if you fine-tune a model to be very specific and then you
quantize it it has it tends to have a lot lower error rate compared to using a
generic LLM and then quantizing it when you do that then you typically see a
higher error rate because the use case has kind of broadened and when you
quantize it you're kind of losing a lot of the data sets that initially was in
that model and now it's being removed so it really depends on the use case it
does make sense especially in edge networks or hardware level stuff and I've
seen this happen where people built really small and I think people keep
forgetting like LLMs is not just AI so many other models that aren't LLMs that
are being used at hardware level products to do to do a lot of interesting
things so exactly exactly I looked at your I looked at your website I really got
into the idea of kind of using it as deployment for multiple small models as
agents to do things exactly we immediately told you get this guy see if
we could talk to him right now it's not a very big theme it's just
four of us including myself but we are hiring right now so I don't know if this
is a good place to show I'm looking for a job what are you hiring for we're
looking for I mean we're looking for two AI roles one is a full-stack engineer
that basically think of it like an indie hacker just build a lot of site
projects around Jixar stack integrations partnership integrations like we work
with companies like Grokling chain we are integrated with a lot of them so
just maintaining those stuff and getting more integrations out there this I think
you all know right that I'm of agentic platforms I hate that we're agentic
right now but like there's so many agentic platforms in the market I'm using
agentic that's quite right out the agent think the term because everybody's
using that term it's a pretty broad film yeah yeah so that's one the second
thing is AI research so big because we are fine-tuning models we implement a
lot of research being done by different companies the thing that we
realize in the field today is that there's so much research being done but not
being implemented one example is recently there was this paper that talks
about how you can increase the output of whisper tree models by using an LLM
after you quantize the model so if you quantize the model to like a one-third
size it gives you a horrible output but then you take that output and then you
pass it an LLM to kind of teen it up you can get a better quality and result
than using a full whisper tree model and it was interesting yeah that's yeah
that's amazing what so if you can link me to a paper that would be great let me
find out what your plans how do you how do you plan to go jigsaw and what do
you see yourself trying to do in a year or two yeah I think this year our focus
has really been on develop experience year one was figuring out our models our
workflows and that's what that's when 24 right that's when we launched it that's
when we kind of went into beta we were figuring out what we wanted to do how
we gonna build our models we've got that settled in 2024 2025 is really focus on
the develop experience and this is why we are working with partners building our
SDK in a way that's super simple right you don't have to think you just plug
and play and you're getting the best of both worlds plugged into your your your
into your text type right so you don't have to kind of stuck we stuck to LLM's
just pure LLM's anymore this is whole suite of AI tools so my goal is to
really get users to understand that hey if you want to do other things besides
LLM's that you can add into your through to add AI into your text type this is
why range of tools available and the goal is just to get it out there I think
for 2025 right true better develop experience through integrations through
partnerships hackathons and I think the best place to be is Silicon Valley for
those kind of things yeah yeah there's a lot going on here I think with the new
administration coming in we're gonna see a lot more oh yeah I hope so I'm being
coming to coming back it's been dead the last two years I've been out of work
for a year and a half and anyway I'll hit you up offline because I'm
interested in that position where you build projects because that's what I've
been doing a lot of two years using AI trying to get some stuff off the ground
I don't have any customers yet but Jay and I are working on global threat
that info which uses a llama under the hood and that's pretty good it we
basically script data not looking for real-time events that could be of
interest for some sort of global threat notification app yep so reason they
had to sort of apply and classify the stuff we find and you know the threat
level what what sort of industry it's regarding if it's shipping or terrorist
attack or gun shooting or whatever we we try to categorize that and then
when I first saw your side I thought I wonder if I could build something like
this using system prompts on a llama I'm curious if you guys tried that first
it just sucked and you decided to train your own models so I mean when we
launched it's like we initially thought like hey cool LMS exists can we just use
LLMs to build a suite of these tools and now we tried we tried so it's with like
GPT4 like you know proprietary models we try using GAT1 fine-tuning systems as
well then we try using LAMAR 3.1 then when 3.2 came out we tried that the
output always never worked and we tried variations of it right like Lava
which is like their vision model almost all of them don't work really well when
you want to go into deep vertical use cases like translation or OCR exactly
so like it's a it's a cheap version of open AI well free it is it is I mean I
rent the GPU it's still cheaper than paying for open AI that is true that is
true and that's the thing it's great for chat applications or anything that
requires a human in that process the moment you remove the human and that's
where the whole bucket of back-end use cases come in automation workflows they
suck and that's where that's where we want to fit in yeah yeah yeah your pricing
is not too bad I mean I don't know how long of what is it a hundred credits or
something hold on on the free tier hundred yeah it is yeah when I'm 27 a
month to scale up from there that's pretty good good pricing to start out
I'm a developer and I hate I hate like commitment here so I'm just like I
like usage based pricing so I try to keep the price as low as possible and keep
it to your usage as much as possible so you just pay for what you use rather
than yeah yeah I like the one-time lifetime plans but they don't work with
AI software so yeah if GPUs are one time then I would offer that yeah that gets
expensive running AI I mean they're even talking about building nuclear power
plans now and all that you know but this is really cool stuff we're gonna we're
gonna start this use your stuff here now and see what we could run with maybe
we could come up with something interesting percent and percent are you
thinking of a lot new interesting ideas this year I think some that every
still kind of figuring out some things that we want to do like some frameworks
that we can use we realize one of the use case that a lot of people use
Jigsaw stack with is chaining them up like very agentic stuff right you know
tool calling function calling and stuff so we're thinking of ideas where we can
have a platform called workflows where you can chain multiple Jigsaw stack
tools together and then you know you can change it with other LLMs and stuff to
build a more accurate pipeline for it because right now if you tell for example
an LLM extract this text from this image from me it will work but at the
end of the day you don't have structured data that you can actually use in a
reproductive reproducible manner so now can I take a smaller model like a 7B
model a 7B model that doesn't have this capability but then can offload this
capabilities to like Jigsaw stack to do the actual work and then act as that
small model on the edge to do the human the loop stuff and you off yeah this is
very interesting stuff man I have to connect you with a couple people so the
other company that I'm kind of working with we're doing training on just and
not just GPUs but different kinds of processor stacks and this idea of using
see what you hit hit it out of the park with me with is it's not just LLM's
people don't take into account that we have all of these other models that we
could do a ton of stuff at lower rates and teaming up with LLMs which is
exactly you're doing basically and making that LLM actually do something much
more tangible and useful other than just a bunch of rubbish at times yeah
oh regarding your ad on daily pings is that working out for you or what do you
think I think um no it's good give us a huge set of referrals initially I think
right now what we want to do is also support people who are building things
in developer community and that's one way for us to get our name out there we
can do Twitter ads we can do you know those kind of stuff as well but I value
platforms like daily being a lot more because you get those early developers
that like platforms very early in the pipeline so that's where I see products
built like my Eric and you know other engineers that focus on I think recently
there's this guy building mini plex that competes with perplexity and stuff like
that there's a bunch of this like you know indie hacker developer projects that
I like to support a lot more they corporate projects because they stay
true to the engineers at the end of the day and I think that's where I want to
be have you tried Reddit advertising on like startups our startups and our
entrepreneurs not advertising but organic post here so organically if we
think we can do stuff that we want to but not pain at this point we don't at
this point we don't see the value in paying because we're so early we want
to really get like clear and honest feedback and like really early developers
that use us but I think at the latest stage has something we might explore
there's this website we're actually gonna have the guy on next weekend on
episode six a TISCO ATISKO and it's kind of using AI to generate Reddit posts to
sort of go viral and not not so much spammy and not promotional so you don't
get you know banned I just started using that today and I invited him on a
podcast you should do it but check out those guys they're pretty cool they have
a free tier when you click the subreddit so you basically enter your URL it goes
out and scrapes it and tries to figure out what you know what industry you're
in and all the keyboards and shit I think suggests a bunch of subreddits for
you to post on so as soon as you click one of the subreddits it generates a
pose for you that doesn't preach but that's where they charge it's also usage
based but I think you get like a hundred credits in the beginning for free I'm
gonna give no let's check it out pricing plan is pretty good I don't know how
well works but I think read the way to go I'm getting more and more traction on
Reddit and I tell you nobody interacts with me on Twitter yeah X is pretty much
I don't know it just seems some right-wing echo chamber now it's pretty cool
I'm Eric some blues guy I talked to him once in a while on there we just created
a blue sky account today like this organization all accounts I'm nice I mean
is not sure you know that's what noster no that's not notes and strings over
relays oh it's an open source distributed platform kind of like Twitter but
okay they run off relays and anybody can work run a relay and that's how they
do their moderation if somebody spamming they just kick off the delay but
check it out go to like primal.net is the one I use it uses like coin so the
difference is like you can zap people micro payments in Satoshi's and you can
earn them as well so it's kind of cool where like you're not the product in
more you know like on Twitter yeah yeah like crazy websites so I'm kind of
thinking about playing around with Jigsaw and using it for the for the
global threat product that Anthony and I are working on I guess yeah doing some
couple things so we'll we'll be we'll definitely be in touch for that and see
if we can actually launch 100% we're currently doing with Jigsaw yeah no let
me know yeah let me wish you specific API could help I can see what I can do
there as well yeah cuz we do because if you help build up a product that and
then get some sales and that definitely will get raise some eyebrows for you
yeah no 100% that sounds good man yeah I mean if you guys know somebody that's
using our work cuz we have not launched the embedding model officially yet but
we're benchmarking the shit out of it and it's super difficult to benchmark
embedding models because you need real world actual data set so we have a few
companies that has integrated our embedding models tested it out give me
yeah if you know more companies that's willing to do that and we're giving it
for free by the way to kind of run it and stuff because we just need a lot more
testing to be done compared to every amount of other models we can benchmark
it's super easy right embedding is it's one it was difficult just because you're
doing training and there's not a lot of you I there's one person I really want
to connect you with and we'll talk offline about that I think he's gonna
have a blast kind of talking to you you guys are doing some wonderful wonderful
stuff and like I said I'm gonna with Anthony here offline we're gonna start
seeing if we could do something with global threat and what you're doing with
jigsaw yeah augment what we're doing because I think it's a really cool idea
oh that's amazing have you heard of I think it's clever that AI clever clever
something as almost exactly what you're doing I did not use them but I can't
across them well let me check is it clever or something like that no that's
not it man I wish I could remember where I saw that it was posted on
reddit a couple weeks ago yeah but they were more expensive and then Jay and I
were looking at your website like a week ago we're locked in this seems just as
good as little guys but a lot cheaper yeah yeah we'll also check it out what's
what's better for for you is like I mean that at least from the developer
perspective is you're not using a lot of buzzworthy stuff like agentic and
yeah workflows we're trying to implement and and it's pretty it's I mean it's
fun I wouldn't say it's super novel but it cuz everybody's just like trying to
run with oh what rapper you could build on top of GPT but you're exactly that
you could take a bunch of different workflows with a bunch of different
models is is kind of yeah what what's interesting is that we aren't trying to
compete with most of the new day AI companies that come in being created
today that like you know they try to wrap llama or like GPT for some LLM but
instead we're trying to compete with the big tree cloud providers right like
AWS cloudflare not Azure and you know those guys the reason is because if you
look into the business model they have two big sectors they have DR server
infrastructure stuff like EC2 instances their GPUs they make billions from that
the other half of the business that I that I believe that they aren't doing
very well is their service business if you go into Google AWS and Azure all of
them provide some sort of API for OCR or translation or text to speech speech
to text and they suck they really really suck but that's where developers kind
of like hit the the kind of stuck with those providers right it's difficult to
leave those big cloud providers because they provide a suite of tools that you
just read it in AWS you're kind of using that suite of tools so you're in Azure
using that suite of tools so we benchmark ourselves significantly against those
providers as we're trying to say hey can we take over that service side of that
business from Azure AWS and stuff we provide better OCR model or better
translation model like your Google translate for example it's so far
behind even an LLM could beat the translations today right so we're using
a llama for translations I started to we we first we searched Google in the last
day using different keywords and then we translate those keywords to like Russian
Chinese Korean yeah Arabic to find out like the hotspots you know the
axis of evil so yeah and we use llama 3.1 7b to translate yeah and then we
scrape the articles and then we translate those back to English and then we
classify them I don't have sentiment we should add sentiment to yeah double
threat but that would be a good one to have yeah you should try to translate
it could be better than the one they're using yeah let's use jigsaw to do it yeah
yeah but I added you on LinkedIn if you connect with me I'll connect you with
the person I want to yeah you guys will hit it off especially with the services
thing that you talk about I think it might be worthwhile but we're makes
that we're definitely you know right after this on you and I were talking
Anthony about how we can use this really really interesting product idea
perfect perfect no I love that let me know if any other issues you're happy
tough I wanted to ask you have you heard a diffi.ai
diffi diffi like different the I F D I know I don't AI no it's it's a self-hosted
AI agent platform now I can get it to work with Docker but I'm just curious if
you look at it I'm looking at it right now yeah it's like it's basically like
length graph right like this it just kind of orchestrates different models
together so you can kind of organize all the models yeah in one plug yeah yeah
that's a yeah there's so many of these I have seen we try to integrate as much as
we can like crew.ai that's one of those guys that do something similar but not
self-hosted I think this looks like they're doing rag off the default models
that are popular right now yeah is they're talking about vector storage as part
of the pricing plan that's that's usually rag stuff right that is yeah
you're probably way ahead of these guys if you're training yourself and the
thing is we don't provide like so these I think there's more
orchestration so usually we add tools within a platform like diffi so some of
it but we don't provide vector storage or this kind of infrastructure side of
things which there's hundreds of different providers you can pick from
yeah yeah yeah I wish I could figure out that one that I saw the other day I'm
curious for what your opinion was of them but that's cool man I mean yeah we
definitely has your marketing and how are you guys making money yet or how many
users you got right now we are hitting closer to 5,000 active users monthly and
trying to scale that number up we have on average we have our own three million
API request a month we want to get three billion a day so that's that's the goal
yeah I think so I think marketing is going good we just got an angel our dev
rel just joined the team as well so I think he's gonna be upping the game when
it comes to content creation writing more blog posts a lot more content and we
were exploring AI generated SEO content as well so that's something that we're
looking into and yeah do you guys have a discord we do actually not very active
but we do is mostly used for support right now I just saw it on your website I
have to join yeah do do join us try to make it active give us some give us some
love there I swear I find companies that use discord they're definitely ahead of
the game I think oh yeah I I keep using slack to be honest when it comes to
it comes to develop a related at least what's looks but I was a year's ago it's
not cool anymore yeah no but we're still forced to use it unfortunately because
some companies right for partnerships the only way to use it is to select so
yeah I still use it when I work usually they're either on slack or
discord it's like a lot of the newer companies are in this car but yeah the
ones are a few years old are still stuck on slack the worst is when you got one
that wants to use teams I'm just like no cuz I run Linux we we had one
enterprise customer from Mexico of like all country that they want to kind of
want to get they basically work with the government to scan the documents and
get it mapped into their database and stuff and yeah because they work with
the government they use teams and the only way to communicate with them for
any sort of documents or steam so that was my like first time installing teams
after years yeah I did a contract with the agency a couple years ago and they
used teams and it was terrible let me ask you a question how are you picking up
these customers that was mainly through daily pings no I don't think it's a very
recent most of it was through YouTube videos we did a bunch of videos that we
did in collaboration with like companies like Superbase, Vercel I think those
hit a lot more views and that get us a lot more traction we do hack and use
hack and use gives us a lot as well yeah and benchmarks I think when we do a lot
of benchmarking articles that tends to help a lot more for example released a
benchmark where we showed our whispered model like for our text to speech to
text model is faster than grok not being the fast yeah so we launched that
benchmark now and we kind of showcase our the open source the code and
everything and yeah and yeah so those kind of things really give us a lot more
traction I think just doing a lot more content really helps and more I think
for some reason I think block articles have given us less traction than video
so video content really helps a lot for us very cool yeah awesome man this was
great yeah I have to run I don't know if you guys want to end this here or you
want to keep talking without without me but it's up to you guys but if you want
Anthony I'll click the leave button here instead of closing it out so it ends
benignly how about that no we can end it we don't have to go past I mean I'd like
to get these podcasts up to an hour but we're kind of running out stuff to talk
about so it's all good yeah I think you know everyone listening check out jigsaw
stack calm pretty cool and join their discord check us out share you can
subscribe to our newsletter it's free if you want to comment you have to be a
paid member but yeah we don't have a lot of users yet
you oven but we're gonna get there we've been doing this a month so we'll have to
back months and see where you're at hopefully sounds good take care all right
nice to meet you guys cheers you guys no wait let me stop the recording guys don't
