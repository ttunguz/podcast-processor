Here is the analysis of the podcast transcript with the requested sections:

1. EPISODE CONTEXT
- Podcast name and episode focus: Unnamed podcast focused on discussing Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, and related economic and philosophical topics
- Hosts and their backgrounds/roles: 
Alex (last name not provided) - Background not discussed
- Guests and their roles/backgrounds:
Murad (last name not provided) - Early Bitcoin proponent, researcher, and popular long-form writer on Bitcoin topics. Starting his own crypto trading company.
- Featured company overview: N/A

2. KEY INSIGHTS
- Bitcoin is a monetary phenomenon first, not a payments technology. Its reinvention of money is the real opportunity.
"Bitcoin is a monetary phenomenon first. It's not a payments technology. And this is one of the areas that makes me crazy, is that payments technologies are trivial. There's tens, there's hundreds of them. It doesn't matter. A reinvention of the tool that human beings use in order to cooperate and build complexity in society, another word for that is money, that reinvention is not trivial."
This is significant because many people misunderstand Bitcoin's core value proposition. 

- The next major adopters of Bitcoin will be institutions and high net worth individuals, not retail. 
"Institutions and the high network individuals...Definitely more of the former than the latter. OTC and custodians and some of the financial products that will come up."
The entry of sophisticated investors will be a major driver of the next bull cycle.

- Inequality and differentiation, not equality, are fundamental to functional human systems and nature itself. Bitcoin enables this productively.
"I don't believe in equality, period...I don't think people are equal. In any way at all. And I actually think that inequality is a natural fabric or reality...And I actually think it's even desirable because nature wants the best man and the best woman to reproduce and to create the next superior generation of human genome."
Bitcoin provides a fair playing field while still allowing inequality to productively exist.

3. TECHNOLOGY & PRODUCT DEVELOPMENTS
- The Lightning Network has immense potential beyond just payments, possibly even bigger than Bitcoin itself. It will enable a new universe of capabilities.
"I think lightning might be bigger than Bitcoin itself. Like obviously not from like a valuation or anything standpoint, but I think like when it's all said and done, lightning and related technologies will make the base layers look minimalist in comparison."

4. COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
- Privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Monero and Zcash don't provide enough benefits beyond Bitcoin to win long-term. Liquidity and stability of monetary policy are more important.
"These engineers, they don't understand that how important monetary liquidity is, how important these sort of more financial monetary dynamics are. It's just going to be an uphill battle. It's not enough, I'm not bullish."

- Decred has interesting qualities in security and governance that could make it a viable competitor to Bitcoin.
"Decred is powerful because it does both differently, not just one of them, but both...I think declared will become a Bitcoin hedge."

5. TEAM & CULTURE SIGNALS
N/A  

6. KEY METRICS & BUSINESS DETAILS
N/A

7. NOTABLE TECHNOLOGIES
- Hybrid proof-of-work/proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms like that used by Decred could provide even greater security than pure proof-of-work.
"I actually hate pure proof of stake. I don't think it's gonna work...But the beauty of hybrid proof of stake is that it doesn't suffer from any of the problems of pure proof of stake."

8. COMPANIES MENTIONED
- Decred: "I'm bullish on Decred because it does like six things differently. And I really like them." Murad believes Decred's unique hybrid proof-of-work/proof-of-stake model and governance give it potential.

9. PEOPLE MENTIONED
- Satoshi Nakamoto [Creator of Bitcoin]: "And to think that we're gonna do this somehow in the space of 10 years, just because we live in the technological age, is absolutely preposterous, it's absolutely insane."
Referenced in discussing how long Bitcoin will take to develop and gain adoption.

- Jordan Peterson: "Jordan Peterson even talks about this. He says that even if you had a government that made everybody get the exact same salary where the exact same clothes and even have the exact same looks and bodies. People would still figure out some kind of a game to compete and to create hierarchies because we have a collective demand for inequality."
His ideas on the inevitability of inequality and hierarchies are discussed.

In summary, this was a wide-ranging discussion hitting on many core concepts around Bitcoin, its long-term potential, and its philosophical underpinnings. The key takeaways are Bitcoin's unique monetary properties, the Lightning Network's immense potential, the likely adoption by institutions in the next cycle, and the productive role of inequality that Bitcoin enables.

(upbeat music)
- All right, so I think we're good sir.
Hi, bro, I'm gonna get off tonight.
Murad, thank you for staying up
at two o'clock in the morning over where you are, man,
to jump on the show with me.
Ladies and gentlemen, Murad needs little introduction
these days, but I'm gonna give him one,
and we're not gonna call him Jimmy Song,
because apparently I was gonna call him Jimmy Song
by accident.
Murad is a early Bitcoin component,
says an avid researcher and he's one of the more popular
long-form writers in the Bitcoin verse,
and also obviously on Twitter.
Some of his charts, some people say
that they actually dictate the price of Bitcoin,
but looking at them from a long-term perspective,
they're one of the more spot-on analysis of Bitcoin,
particularly that I've seen.
I've been a big fan of his work for a while now,
especially what I look at as his pragmatic approach
to Bitcoin's long-term life cycle and the logical viewpoints
on what some people might call extreme viewpoints,
i.e. Bitcoin becoming a global financial settlement network
or Bitcoin going to $1 million or $10 million of coins.
So we're gonna talk about a whole lot of stuff today.
This might last for one hour, two hours, three hours,
god knows, so we've chosen to do audio
so that way people can download
and just listen to it when they're driving
as opposed to looking at us for no reason.
So yeah, Murad, welcome, dude.
- Hey, thanks for having me, Alex.
Big pleasure to be here.
Been looking forward to this particular podcast episode
for a while.
Huge fan of a lot of your writing as well.
Some of you, the charts you've drawn in particular,
I have sent to a bunch of people
to a bunch of groups and communities.
I agree with like 95% of what you've been saying so far
pretty wholeheartedly.
So yeah, really excited to have this conversation.
- Cool, man.
Well, in the spirit of getting a bit of background,
people have heard me talk about my shit a little while,
particularly if they're listening to my podcast here.
So maybe just for people that don't know you yet,
let's dig into just a little bit on your background.
People have probably heard the Pumps podcast with you,
but if you can just give us the two minute brief
of your background, again,
how you quickly got into Bitcoin
and then what you're working on now
before we kick into everything.
- Yeah, totally.
So I'm originally from Azerbaijan,
for those who don't know where that is,
like many of my Western friends,
that's a post-Soviet country.
It's between Turkey and Russia, physically.
So essentially grew up there,
went to a bunch of American schools
for like middle school, primary school,
high school, et cetera.
Went to USA to study at university.
I did a semester abroad while there
and that was during the previous bubble,
like end of 2013, early 2014, I was in China,
which was how I got into Bitcoin in the first place.
A lot of the people who were like internationals
there with me, some of my friends,
because a lot of the Chinese exchanges back then
still didn't have a lot of liquidity nor infrastructure.
Some of my friends were essentially bringing Bitcoin
from abroad and selling them at a small premium
to the Chinese.
And that's how I sort of got in.
It was an exciting time.
When I came back to America,
sort of some of my more sort of technical
and engineer friends,
they sort of kept sort of being in the industry.
And one of my roommates sort of was relatively early
to Ethereum, sort of it was even earlier to Bitcoin itself.
And so I kind of kept up with the space.
As many of us did, sort of took a small pause, 2015,
but 2016 sort of got back in
and every year since then got sort of more and more involved.
Worked on Wall Street for a little bit
and now just been doing more and more crypto stuff,
launching my own sort of crypto trading company
in the next couple of months.
So quite excited about that.
Come on, what did you, what were you doing over Wall Street?
Analyst or?
- Yeah, I was doing like interest rates and forex trading.
- Okay, cool, cool.
As a trader or more as an analyst?
- As an analyst.
- Yeah, okay, come on.
What was it?
So I always find it interesting
'cause I think a lot of us,
I mean, we ended up having this journey.
We heard about the thing, we saw people get into it,
but we ended up straying off doing something else.
What was the kicker that got you back in?
Like what was that piece in 2016
that pushed you down the rabbit hole?
- I think what happens with a lot of people is that,
well, we know that Bitcoin moves in cycles
and I think a lot of,
what happened to almost every single person that I know
is they heard about it once, they didn't get in.
They might have heard about it twice, they didn't get in.
But if they keep repeatedly
with sort of year-long breaks in between,
keep seeing that this thing doesn't only die,
but actually every time they hear,
it's statistically likely that it's during a time
where a price keeps climbing fast.
You start realizing that there must be something here.
And it's that combined with, at least in my case
and in some other people's case,
some very intelligent people that you respect, they urge you
to sort of take a deeper look.
And you do and you realize
that there's definitely something here.
And so you kind of jump into the rabbit hole
and then, as I like to say,
once you are in the Bitcoin rabbit hole,
it's forever, like it never stops.
- I won't get out, it's past the event horizon then.
- Yeah, totally.
- Can you, are you able to attribute it
to a particular person that you think was someone
where the penny dropped for you?
- For me, it was sort of like, I just like read a lot
and just like browse like interesting stuff
on the internet a lot.
And I believe that like, I've been a trader
for quite a while, like both professionally and like personally.
And I believe that the most important thing you can do
as a trader and as an investor is just read
like as much as you can for like eight hours a day.
And I've always like separately been interested
in like monetary econ.
And like a libertarian Austrian stuff as well,
just like history of central banking, all that stuff.
And once I read like article number seven,
article number eight, article number nine on Bitcoin,
like it started clicking, you know?
And like once you're there, it's just you just stay there.
- It's so true.
Like if I was on a podcast a couple weeks ago
and talking about what clicked for me.
And it was, I can attribute a big part of the sense
that Bitcoin made to me via actually Andreas.
And the reason is so, I mean,
I think a lot of us in this space,
particularly the Bitcoiners have an affinity
or some sort of experience with the econ,
the central banking, all of that stuff.
I mean, I remember watching Zeitgeist by Peter Joseph
when it first came out and going to Robbie,
you know, Journey as well.
And I mean, it's funny how Bitcoin's just
at the nexus of all of these disparate disciplines.
And this is what I usually say to people and ask me,
it's like, well, what the hell are you interested
in this thing for?
And I said, I don't know how I could not.
It blends economics with biology with, you know,
game theory with Austrian economics, with, you know,
even concepts like tie-labs skin in the game,
like it just, it combines all of these things
in one melting pot and it stretches your brain.
Like in, you know, like you, I mean, this week,
I've been writing a big paper
because I've got a presentation to do next week.
And the title of my presentation is blockchain is dead,
long live lightning.
And I'm gonna be giving this at an investment summit
where the majority of the investment summit
is being sponsored by blockchain companies.
- Yeah.
- I'm probably gonna get shot.
But in the process of writing that I had so much stuff
to come out and I touched on so many areas,
but that sort of breadth of information only comes
from like you said, reading and studying like a maniac
and connecting all of these dots,
which you would never think are connected.
Like whenever I get up on stage and talk to people,
I say the best book that, you know, everyone should read
or one of the best books that everyone should read
to understand Bitcoin is that you've ours book sapiens
because it talks about how we've evolved as a species
and it hits on one of the central points being
this idea of shared fictions.
And then you start to understand why money exists
in the first place and then the extension of that,
you start to understand why money should be something
that, well, money is foundational to our ability
to operate as human beings in a society.
And therefore the more foundational it is,
the stronger, sturdier and more rigid it must be.
And then it's like the concept of Bitcoin
and how it's been designed and why it exists
starts to make so much sense, man.
- Yes, yeah, definitely.
And the beauty is that it's probably the most
interdisciplinary field that I've ever witnessed.
And there's just, like, I think,
like I essentially like try to study these things
like all day long for the past two years, maybe longer.
And I feel like if I dedicate my whole life to it,
I probably won't even understand like 3% of it.
You know what I mean?
Not even because of the technical difficulty
but just because there's just so much.
And the beautiful thing is that there isn't a single person
that knows all of it.
Like maybe like Nick Zabo kind of comes close
but really maybe not even him because like you have,
there's a lot of brilliant cryptographers
and software engineers in the space,
but they just like don't get the monetary aspect.
And then there's a lot of like trading types
and the finance types,
but they don't have the technical skills at all.
I mean, of course the technical skills
are much more difficult, but still like,
what I'm saying is there is a place for everybody
and no one knows everything.
And that's part of what makes it exciting.
- Absolutely, bro.
Now perfectly put.
Well, the next piece,
and I think as we go through this,
where everything that we've just mentioned
is gonna start to make sense
as people realize how broad this topic actually is,
but I wanna dive into your article,
the one that you wrote with Adam,
the many faces of Bitcoin.
So, and I know you've probably been asked this a million times
for when people sort of interview you,
but where they've asked you to explain
what, you know, explain a little bit about that article,
you know, touch on the four theories
and sort of your viewpoint
about which theory carries the most weight.
So, you know, I mean,
do you wanna give people a quick overview of
when you guys were writing that,
what was the driver behind it?
And, you know, what those four areas were?
- Yeah, totally.
So, the four, like we kind of realized
that there are many different factions in the space
as a lot of misinformation as well.
So we kind of, to make it easier to some of our readers,
we wanted to at least try to categorize
some of these quote unquote teams.
And I would say that the four views are,
well, the first of all,
it's the kind of the, we call it the crypto Austrian view.
And it's kind of this idea that money,
at least for the time being,
cryptocurrencies need to prioritize
the store of value functionality
because like there exists a disadvantage to spend two people
want their potential medium of exchange
and day to day cash to be stable.
They want it to be liquid.
And none of these things are going to come
before cryptocurrency or before Bitcoin
is like a multi-trillion-dollar asset.
And that in itself isn't gonna come
before people try to start using it
at least as a semi-spec with the savings vehicle.
And savings vehicle is essentially
the same thing as the store of value.
So we need to, at least for the time being,
optimize the base layer particularly
as to be a store of value.
And we need to optimize security.
We need to optimize credibility of monetary policy,
things like that.
And that's kind of like the main view.
You know, safety and pure HR and a bunch of others
have been the proponents of this view for many years.
The second view is more of like the sort of like
kind of the Bitcoin cash view
where they are prioritizing the payment network aspect
of the system and the medium of exchange quote unquote
aspect of the system as like as the dominant one.
I don't even want to give it too much attention
because I think like the people who are bullish
on Bitcoin cash in any way at all.
In my opinion, they just like don't understand
monetary economics or the evolution of money
or the origins of money at all.
And they're essentially just either ignorant
or outright scammers.
And so yeah, it's just like it's just totally ridiculous.
Like it just makes absolutely no sense.
Like I don't even know if we should even discuss it.
No, but yeah, essentially the idea is that
they believe that it needs to be used in exchange
in order for like it to actually be useful.
But they don't understand that this is like
a multi-decade evolution.
And it needs to evolve in these stages.
And no one is going to use like for something
to be even used as a medium of exchange.
It needs to have value in the first place.
And gold doesn't have value because of like
the jewelry or even industrial uses.
Gold has evolved to be money because it had
the best stock flow ratio among all the physical objects.
And really it's that quote unquote monetary policy
that made it money, not the jewelry.
Like I actually...
- Time is the limit. - Right, right, right.
- Community generationally to view it as something
that doesn't just fucking vanish or disappear.
But if they hold it, it's there still.
So it...
- Totally. - Generational thing.
- It's a combination of durability
and low inflation essentially.
- Yes, yes.
Dude, I actually want to dig into the store
of value piece first quickly.
And we'll get onto the final to the Nash's equilibrium
and the other one in a second.
But coming to the whole store of value piece,
'cause I think people don't understand
what store of value is.
And sometimes I go insane trying to explain this to people
is particularly, and Bitcoin caches drive me nuts here,
is they're like, oh yeah, so much for your store of value,
it's fallen from 20,000 to 3,000.
And it's like, that is not the definition
of store of value.
The definition of a store of value is that
when you...
And the way I try and explain it to them is
if I bought one Bitcoin,
I still have one Bitcoin that has not fucking changed.
And all that we're doing at the moment
is we are discovering the way that we price it.
And the way that we price it is being discovered
by hundreds of thousands or millions of people around the world,
most of which you don't fucking understand it.
So yes, there is gonna be volatility at the moment.
But what's important is that when I hold
an attribution of the network,
so some component of the network
is attributed to the private keys that I hold
in some way, shape or form,
the proportion that I hold is not gonna be diluted,
it's not gonna be changed, it's not gonna be confiscated,
it's not gonna be inflated out.
So therefore, it is storing its value
in terms of its attribution or its percentage of the network.
And that is the definition of store of value.
And over time, as more people realize that,
they then imbue it with further value
and they trust holding more actual wealth on this network.
And that's sort of the way I try to explain it up.
Can you help a brother out here
and sort of either concur or tell me
how you try and explain the definition of store value,
that it's not, store value is not related
to the day-to-day speculative price of the asset as well.
- Totally, well, one BTC equals one BTC,
that's all that matters.
And at first glance,
it sounds like an extremely superficial,
meaningless equation, but I actually admit matters a lot.
I agree with you totally.
The volatility of Bitcoin is simply the world
coming to grips about what this thing is.
And it's completely fine that its early years
and even early decades are driven more so
by greed, hype and speculation,
rather than usage per se.
I would even argue that speculation
and mere huddling are use cases.
Now, you know how they say that like a human lifetimes
is nothing in the grand scheme of the universe.
It's kind of in relative terms, it's kind of like a split second.
It's the same thing for something
that is aspiring to be both the global reserve currency
and the global payment network.
I mean, 10 years in terms of these grand technologies,
10 years is nothing.
Now, of course, I believe that Bitcoin will conquer the world,
orders and orders of magnitude faster than gold did
because it's naturally much more scalable, faster
and will live in a much more globalized world.
And naturally, the internet and associated technologies
are fundamentally exponential technologies.
And this information, Bitcoin is information.
It can travel the world much faster.
And I believe that what I believe is going to happen
is that we're going to go through these
more like three or four more of these speculative cycles,
but we are still on the left side of the big esker.
And sooner or later, at time will come
when these things become fully competitive
against fiat money.
And I believe they are superior to fiat money.
It is a mathematical fact that they are.
Fiat and gold are already as good as they can ever be,
but Bitcoin will keep improving constantly.
It will keep getting better and faster and more efficient
with all kinds of superior technologies
and infrastructures being built on it, inside it, or around it.
And both as a technology and as a money, it is superior.
What is going to happen is once it reaches that esker stage,
it's really going to go exponential.
And I genuinely believe that if fiat doesn't
hyperinflate completely, then you will simply
see this kind of zero-sum rapid transfer of wealth,
at least the kind of wealth that is currently
parked in one-tier instruments.
And in any kinds of savings vehicles for that matter,
it doesn't only include money.
People think that fiat money and gold
are the only two out of small markets here.
No.
I believe that even 10% to 15% of real estate,
10% to 15% of stocks, a chunk of bonds,
all of these assets, houses aren't only used to live in,
or to work in.
They're used as-- especially for high net worth individuals
or investment-holding companies.
They're used as investments.
They're used as a waste for rich people to park wealth.
Like, exactly.
And I just think that something that is as transferable
and as liquid and as robust as Bitcoin
can even be superior to, say, equities or certain,
like, John Bonds or whatever.
And so I think it's going to clean up
the financial industry.
What I also-- my theory is that money
as a proportion of the-- like, all of asset classes,
I think money will actually get fatter.
And more money will be a bigger part of people's portfolios.
And when money is constantly inflating,
then there are obviously-- artificially, I might add--
there are, of course, disincentives to hoard a lot of it.
But when money is going to be fixed supply,
it's going to arguably be one of the best--
it's not the best-- source of value in the world.
And I think that the market cap of Bitcoin
in the far, far future is going to be bigger
than the market caps of all fiat currencies currently combined.
And this is where I agree with you.
And this is where people start to say, oh, you know,
you're a fucking sensationalist and all that sort of stuff.
But I think one of the points that you touched on there
that I want to really drive home to people
is one of the biggest reasons that we have so much wealth
in things outside of just money or cash
is because holding your money in cash, as everybody says,
is the worst place to put it because you're actually
losing money over time.
So the incentive or the system is designed for money
to flow into other assets.
And in that process, it drives them up in perceived price,
not value over time.
And what you're saying and what I think people
need to understand here is that when you no longer
have to chase yield-- because that's effectively
what money is doing at the moment.
It's just chasing yield.
Capital just chases yield wherever the fuck it can,
because if it doesn't chase yield, if it's not moving,
it's going backwards.
And the central banks are essentially
treating the citizens like laboratory rats
and constantly electrocuting them by printing more money
so that they have to do something in the short term,
either consume or spend or invest or do something like that,
as opposed to being able to save the fruits of their labor
for it in multi-decade terms and also engage
in multi-decade projects.
You touched on another beautiful piece,
there is this concept of accumulation.
Now, over time, people have--
I mean, when people talk about hoarding money is bad,
or when they're talking about, oh, hodlers,
they're against adoption.
It drives me fucking insane because hodling or hoarding
capital is another way of saying saving.
When in the fucking world did saving become a bad thing,
when in the world, it's crazy.
It's crazy that some people in the world
are actually shaming savers.
Like saving is one of the most--
it's one of the most virtuous things you can do.
It's the basis of capitalism.
This is what people don't understand.
People think, everyone's running around saying,
oh, capitalism, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
It's not capitalism, fuck.
It's the Frankenstein version of capitalism
that we have today, which is focused on spending.
It's focused on the wrong side of the fucking equation.
I like to say that we don't live in capitalism
because money is controlled in a communist manner
or an authoritarian manner, essentially.
And money is just such a big part of every transaction,
commerce, business, interest rates, financial markets.
It's half of all of those transactions.
And it's crazy that some people in the world--
money is the most demanded good.
It's the most demanded product.
It's crazy that certain people and certain institutions
have the ability to create it from thin air.
It is absolutely preposterous, if you think about it.
And it's very vampiric because these people
are doing it, essentially, at the expense of everybody else.
This doesn't just come about randomly.
This was carefully constructed by very, very intelligent people.
And Bitcoin is powerful because it makes the system obsolete.
I really like the phrase, don't try
to change the system from the inside
or try to change it little by little.
The way to truly bring about change
is to create a product that simply transcends.
It makes the existing system completely obsolete.
Yeah, that's what the internet did to the fucking phone
companies, right?
Oh, definitely.
And it's actually a big part of my presentation
during the week because it's going
to be at this technology conference.
Like I said, but a bunch of people,
there are blockchainers.
But what I'm telling them is that the internet
transcended the phone companies, had their own biases.
And they controlled communication for the last 100 years.
And they thought that they could own the internet
or they could dictate the way in which we were going to communicate.
So then what happened was we had a simple, basic, foundational,
robust set of infrastructure, which all it did
was route packets of data through a mesh network
that was extremely fucking hard to shut down.
And guess what?
Human beings built complexity and innovation on top of that.
So when I try and explain a thing, Bitcoin is a network to people,
I say Bitcoin is very similar to the internet,
not the way people try and tell you,
but in its fundamental sense that the internet
is a packet data packet routing service.
That's all it fucking is at its base level
that operates on a set of rules, in other words, protocols.
Bitcoin is a value routing network that doesn't fail
because it's gang theoretically sound.
So anybody that wants to perform one of three functions,
the function of send, store, receive,
which are the ingredients, the basic building blocks
of any financial transaction or any monetary related transaction
in the world, why would you not use a network that has that baked into it
and has a guarantee of delivering those functions?
So what Bitcoin's done is it's transcended that
because those functions today are predicated on us,
begging or asking some institution or some organization
to perform them for us using our cake methods,
which is let's send a fucking message between each other.
It's, yeah, I'm going to, I don't want to get on a tangent there,
but it's, like you said, this transcends it
because it reinvents money.
And I think another highlight for people to take away
while they're listening to this is when I look at Bitcoin,
this is where the Bitcoin caches really get it wrong,
is Bitcoin is a monetary phenomenon first.
It's not a payments technology.
And this is one of the areas that makes me crazy,
is that payments technologies are trivial.
There's tens, there's hundreds of them.
It doesn't matter.
A reinvention of the tool that human beings use
in order to cooperate and build complexity in society,
another word for that is money,
that reinvention is not trivial.
And that is where the opportunity is here.
- Yeah, I like to say that like my friend into him,
like what Bitcoin is in like the most simple way possible.
And I told him it's pieces of super gold
flying inside an unstoppable PayPal.
But I totally agree with you.
Is the super gold that really matters here?
Not so much the PayPal.
I mean, of course, they're both inextricably linked
in Bitcoin, but to me, at least personally,
the scarce 21 million side of it
and the money, the store value side of it,
the deflationary side of it,
that's the real revolution,
even more so dare I say than the unsensurable payments.
(laughing)
But look, you can't have one without the other, right?
- No, of course, of course you can't.
Of course you can't.
They are all interconnected.
But I think like I always think as an investor
and like from an investment point of view,
it's I think I strongly think that,
look, there's a bunch of forces
that will attract people to have wealth
flowing to Bitcoin,
but I think mostly it's gonna be disgusting.
- Well, yeah.
I, man, I didn't want to touch on scarcity now,
but let's just touch it really quickly.
Is I was presenting at a meetup the other week
and I mentioned scarcity and someone was like,
well, why scarcity is so important?
Isn't scarcity a bad thing?
I said, no, no, no.
I said, scarcity is,
and you told me if you agree with him on this,
scarcity is fundamental to a human being's notion of value.
And the example that I said to people was,
let's look at, let's think about something
that you value in life.
For example, your friends or your family.
A big part of why you value your friends or family
is anyone ever heard of the saying,
you've only got one brother
or you've only got one family.
The reason we value them so highly is because they're unique.
And uniqueness is a predicate,
so uniqueness is related to this concept of scarcity.
So the more unique something is, the more scarce it is,
the more we inherently as human beings value it.
Now, when we bring that across to units
or objects that are fungible,
the only real fungible unit that we know of is time.
And that's why we, as a society
or as a collective, value time so much.
And when I did the examples or everyone, I said,
if we inherently value things that are scarce,
the more scarce or the more we know without any doubt at all,
that something is scarce, the more we'll inherently value it.
And then I asked people to put their hands up
who would want more time
and how much would you pay to get more time?
And then I just said, well, Bitcoin is the only other unit
that we know of that is fungible
that is also scarce other than time.
If you don't want to pay anything for Bitcoin,
and you want to pay something for time,
there's something wrong with your logic.
So I think scarcity is something
that people just don't understand.
And then when you apply scarcity
to something as foundational as money,
which again, is the tool
through which human beings are able to cooperate
and measure labor, which is what we build
our fucking world out of, then money's fucked.
And that's where money is today, it's completely fucked.
We can't measure it properly.
It's like the inches that through, you know,
Alan Watts says a beautiful thing in one of his lectures.
He said, you know, money is a measuring instrument.
And he doesn't touch on any monetary policy stuff,
but he uses the concept of if you're building a house,
and, you know, you've got wood there,
you want to measure, you know, the timber
or whatever you're using to build stuff in inches.
Now, we don't go and change the inches
or change the measurement when we, you know,
need to build something or if we don't have enough goods
or if we don't have enough of the manufacturing material,
we go and get more manufacturing material.
So the inches need to stay fixed.
And that's, it's almost like the base rules
cannot be changed in order for you to build a strong,
in order for you to build on top off.
If you have a shaky, like quicksand type foundation,
everything falls apart.
And I've touched on about a hundred things there,
but did you have anything to add
with respect to scarcity particularly?
- Yeah, I mean, I like to think of things
in a more sort of Austrian way in the sense
that I never argue what's like, what's good for society
or what's good for the world.
I look at everything through a lens
of like a product and a consumer.
And Bitcoin is just like as a shelling point of money,
it will result in a superior,
like it's in a superior savings vehicle
than compared to one where a central bank
can just print as much of it as it wants, period.
And so people will gravitate to it
because they'll see that it offers stronger guarantees.
That's it.
I think it's a superior product
and consumers will gravitate to it
simply because of that reason.
- Okay, so that thesis then just comes back
to credibility over time,
credibility and monetary policy, right?
- Yes.
- Yeah, and then trust being developed over time.
And again, I'm gonna touch on two last bits here
in this section is the...
Another thing which is a positive for Bitcoin
and I guess another delusion of the Bitcoin caches
is that credibility of monetary policy
and the ability for people to trust Bitcoin
as a scarce unit takes time.
And like you said earlier,
this is not a payments technology
that we need to build out of a couple of years
just so we can compete with PayPal.
This is a monetary phenomenon
which is gonna take decades to develop
because the trust in money or trust in a money
takes generations to develop.
And one of the issues that I've always had
is what I call the junkies of today's society
who all they wanna do is just have something built for them
so they can...
Their definition of adoption is how much I'm spending
so that I can get my dopamine hit really quickly.
It's really funny, it's really funny you say that,
everybody asks me, like the new people
I try to get into Bitcoin, they say,
but where can I spend it?
That's not what Bitcoin is for.
What can I buy with it?
- I'll tell you what you can buy,
some of you fucking future,
just put it in your wallet and shut up.
- It's crazy, man.
- Oh, man.
So yeah, so I think that's just another,
it's just a complete paradigm shift.
And this is where...
I remember when the Bitcoin caching was going on
and in the early days, I didn't wanna start any wars,
but fucking I inevitably went down the war path
with a bunch of them, particularly here in Brisbane.
We have a few strong ones that are big fans of Roger Verne
and all that sort of stuff.
And it drives me insane because, again,
not only do they not understand money,
but their definition of adoption
is the completely wrong definition for a money.
Their definition might fit, again, a payments technology,
but what they should be doing is then going
and buying shares in PayPal, if that's what they want,
if that's where they assume the adoption comes from,
or they should go just start a fucking payments start up.
But...
- You know what's true adoption?
Ever rich person having 3% of their wealth in Bitcoin?
- That is a deal. - Correct.
- Correct.
Bitcoin going to 7 trillion, 10 trillion, that's adoption.
- Yes, yes.
Because then we've shown that this network
is a place that people trust storing some of their wealth,
which in other words makes it a store of value at some...
- Well, more importantly, at that size,
it's going to be better as a medium of exchange product.
- Correct.
- Because it's likely going to be more price stable.
It's going to be more liquid.
Lightning channels will probably be much fatter,
have much more liquidity inside them.
Like, all the infrastructure by that point,
like once you can save it,
like all the infrastructure around it
will be much more mature as well.
So, honestly, like right now,
we want Bitcoin to be widely held.
- Yes.
- It's too early to be thinking about it being widely spent.
- Yes.
- What's important is people,
like you won't have the world to be hodling it.
That's what you want.
- Yes, yes, yes.
- This is the area I think you and I most fervently agree on.
And in fact, I mean, this is why like,
I don't know if you've had a look at the project
that I'm working on is called AMBA.
And if you're familiar with Acorns in the US,
they take the...
- Yeah, yeah, I've listened to you talk about it
on a couple of podcasts.
- Yeah, so, man, my whole thing, when people ask me,
"Oh, you know, when are you going to build
like merchant facilities and stuff?"
I'm like that.
- It doesn't matter.
For the next few years, my only mission with AMBA
is to have a million people be accumulating Bitcoin.
That's it.
Game, set, match.
Don't need fucking anything like that.
- I don't even think like merchant stuff matters right now.
It's like Uber.
- Yeah, it doesn't.
Absolutely not.
- It's, this isn't PayPal.
Like Bitcoin, at least right now,
like Bitcoin is more like Gold 2.0 than PayPal.
- Not even more, but it is.
It's got nothing to do with PayPal right now
because that is not the function that we,
and it's also like, if we think about the war we can win,
this is sort of, if we take another hat,
if we put another hat on, which is,
let's think strategically here as a community.
If, you know, let's think, even let's take away
all of the wars and all that sort of stuff and say,
"Look, let's think about the crypto community as a whole.
Which war or which battle can we win against, you know,
the forces that we're apparently fighting against,
which is, you know, the bank as well,
or whatever people think they're fighting against, right?
It's not the payments battle that we can win
because they're already beating us at that shit.
You know, the PayPal already exists.
We chat already exists.
Ali parity, there's a million payment technologies.
That is a bloody Red Sea battle.
The war we can win or the battle that we can win
is an unsensurable, unconfiscatable,
unmanipilatable form of money.
That's something totally, totally.
It's like, like, getting a UX better than, like,
WeChat or Venmo is just going to be difficult.
That's a two, like, the total artists will market
for money is more than $100 trillion.
But the total artists will market for payments
is like, probably less than a trillion.
So really, which one is the bigger revolution here?
Absolutely.
And last but not least, the base layer
will probably not be used for payments.
Like, that's not really what it's for.
The settlement layer.
The base layer is for extremely high value,
high security demanding settlement transactions
that you want to be essentially ironed
into what's going to be the global source of truth.
Yep.
Couldn't agree, more men.
The last thing I want to touch on here
is the definition of cash, which is another area
that the Bitcoin caches run around.
I mean, they've even chucked it in the damn name.
And they're always, always, always referring to the white paper
and, you know, putting their little red boxes
around the word cash and, you know, saying,
"Oh, look how many times they said cash in the white paper."
Can you please give the listeners and everyone out there
a better definition of cash?
And then I'll see if I need to add any two cents to it.
So, if I understand correctly, historically, cash simply meant
the instrument of final settlement.
Yep.
And that aligns with, in my opinion,
our understanding of Bitcoin much, much more.
Furthermore, frankly, to me,
I don't even care what's written in the white paper.
Yep.
I care about things that can actually work
and things that make sense from a monetary
and historic and technological point of view,
things that are actually sustainable,
rather than, like, rather than defying somebody
or turning somebody into a god figure
and then just trying to dissect their every word.
Sure.
I mean, the collective understanding of Bitcoin developers today
of Bitcoin is probably superior to Satoshi's at this point.
And so it doesn't matter.
And really, people need to remember that Satoshi,
this is a little known fact.
Satoshi wrote the software first
and then wrote the white paper as kind of an explanation.
But really, it's pointless to try to go and dissect
every single semantics.
But please go ahead and add if I missed anything
in the correct definition of cash.
Yeah, well, look, the only thing I'm going to add there
is, like I said, the most important function
of cash is the ability to settle.
But the predicate for cash in any sort of society
is the ability to maintain some level of stable purchasing power.
So something cannot be used as cash whilst it is volatile.
And this is where their entire argument breaks down,
is that by building a better payments system
or a faster payment system,
whatever argument they're trying to put forth,
so that the signal can move faster,
doesn't define a better form of cash
if what is being signaled is still volatile,
because then nobody will use it as cash.
So literally, they remove the legs
from under the table of their argument.
And this is where that progression,
and I love the chart that you did,
and I've obviously done my rendition of a chart,
the little pyramid, is something cannot have a stable network value
until it has a large enough amount
of capital being stored on it for it to function like that.
So this is where it's the whole,
their entire philosophy is the tail wagging the dog.
They want to do payments,
and they're trying to bring forward
the medium and exchange use case before.
You even have the predicate for something to function like cash,
which is, by the time I give it to you,
the fucking thing can't move 20%,
because you can't conduct commerce like that, doesn't work.
And I think that that right,
there just blows the entire argument up for them,
which is cash being a unit of settlement
that allows you to conduct a purchase
in a way that is stable, and that doesn't exist yet.
And we're so far away from that,
and we need to do so much more before we can even get this.
So that's sort of where I want to break down
the basis of cash as a function, or as a thing.
That's my rank.
Yeah, I mean, I wholeheartedly agree.
I don't think we really disagree on anything.
Cool, cool.
Well, so we don't go further down that rabbit hole.
I think we've ticked off a bunch of things there.
Do you want to quickly give the guys,
and a little bit more of an understanding
of Nash's ideal money?
I know, I'm Twitter-tossing that.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Juice Sukripatoshi, a bunch of others talk about it a lot.
Kind of complicated,
but essentially, the idea is that fiat money isn't going to die.
Rather, Bitcoin is going to act as a disciplinary tool
to other countries and other central banks money supplies.
And they will either back their fiat currency with Bitcoin,
or they will simply try to mimic its monetary policy
to be roughly as credible.
Now, I've thought about it quite a lot,
but I still don't really buy this argument.
And it would also still allow them to conduct
a little bit of monetary policy.
Obviously, less so than they can today,
but it would still give them some wiggle room, right?
I don't buy this argument because I can see something
like this being as a transitionary,
maybe solution or a transitionary period.
But really, ultimately, they can still go back and misbehave at any point.
There's no guarantees.
I think our generation in particular is a generation,
which increasingly already does,
and will increasingly continue to trust algorithms,
computers, and networks more than human beings themselves.
Yeah, and I do think that algorithms,
especially of the decentralized, enforced kind,
are more trustworthy than humans.
And I would rather trust a verifiable algorithms,
which is constantly being supported by whatever 40 eggs
a hash and 100,000 full nodes,
rather than some eight fat, old, bold men in a mahogany room
trying to decide what's going to happen for everybody.
And I think the world will--
Yeah, the world will join sort of this trend in marketing.
Well, that comes back to your point earlier,
which is things are going to move to where they're most functional.
And when I always argue, why did the internet win?
It won because more innovation happened there,
and the same argument that we're giving about Bitcoin
is this black hole where everything accrues on it.
The internet became that against all of the other protocols,
all of the other proprietary fucking AOLs
and everything else out there,
is that people realized this was a better foundation
upon which to build and innovate.
And we had a complete infrastructure inversion,
moving from the phone companies trying to say,
"Oh, people want better quality phone calls and video calls,
we're going to send smart signals down our lines."
What's the need of this dumb data packet routing switch service?
It's pointless.
Why would we run that through our beautiful phone lines?
And then all of a sudden, the entire thing inverted.
And not only did it invert, it made them obsolete,
and it paved the way for people to innovate on top of
a robust communications network.
And Bitcoin's doing the same thing,
but for anything that is associated with value and money.
And this is something we're ground.
So Nash's ideal money, I agree with you.
Longer term, I think people will go to what makes more sense.
They'll go to the better product.
And if anchoring to a network like Bitcoin
in order to facilitate modern finance or modern markets
is going to be a better point, then guess what?
It's going to go there.
And the algos aren't going to be designed to prove
the second best to the third best.
They're going to choose the most stable,
the most robust, and best angle they can choose, right?
I think this is where we might disagree a bit,
because I don't think it's going to be 100%
we're going to take all our very long time.
Yup, okay, look.
Again, I actually agree that,
because I don't think that it's going to take 100%,
nothing can take 100% even instead.
I think, so this is the thing.
I obviously disagree with multi-quarters.
We think there's going to be 10 coins or 10 big chains,
right? That's ludicrous.
But I also kind of, at least for the time being,
I disagree with the ultra-maximalists,
who think that we're only going to have one coin
like starting from next week, and everything else dies, right?
I think what's more likely in the medium term,
and I think that's completely reasonable,
is we're going to have three or four dominant chains
and simultaneously start a value candidate, so to speak.
And they're going to be more distributed in a perrito way,
in which is like 70, 20, 8, 2, you know what I mean?
Yup, yup, yup, yup.
It's going to be a power long, it'll be a power long.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.
It's going to be a power long.
Yes, I also think at least,
we'll probably take like 40 years for people
to trust this technology fully, wholeheartedly, right?
And there's still going to be more bugs.
We're still going to have a bunch of things.
And also in general, I think the story value market,
like 100 trillion market, is way too huge
for it just to accrue to one.
And I think the dynamics are also a bit different from gold,
which is like, okay, you have the rock in your hand,
okay, it's safe, right?
But these things are hybrid money software.
The fact that it is software allows it to be superior
in many ways, allows us to have this artificial 21 million
dollar cap, and in many ways allows us to be superior to gold.
But it's also, in many ways, a little bit more fragile
and malleable, I would say, and maybe eventually like 60 years
from now, we'll have one.
But I think for the time being, we'll probably have like three or four.
And I agree with you.
And I think for the time being, and like you've drawn out in your charts,
this thing is going to come in cycles.
So we're still so early in the piece that it's going to still take
another two, three, four cycles for a broad enough,
because it's funny, there's this little meme that I always give to people.
People come in via Bitcoin, they discover all of this other shit,
and they go down fucking Alice in Wonderland and glittery eyes and everything.
And then after about six months or a year or whatever,
if they're saying that they realize that it's all bullshit.
So they end up coming back to like, you know, more or less Bitcoin and Monero,
maybe one other, and then they end up coming full circle just to Bitcoin,
because they're like, oh, fuck it, this is really all that matters.
It's, you know, that's also a form of cycle.
And what happens over time is that more and more people go through that cycle.
And well, there's, I think like, so here's the thing, right?
When I, in middle of January, 2018, my barber in New York was telling me about Iota.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And I wasn't going to sell my coins, but I didn't even plan to like sell it.
I just plan to keep holding it.
But something in my mind just like got me spooked.
And I was like, you know, this is getting out of control.
And so luckily, I wasn't really like even trading that much back then.
I like, I just like, I sold like 80% of my holdings.
And it turned out to be like, like two days before the total talk.
Like, right?
For the altcoins in particular.
And yeah, like, here's the thing, like, this is another thing.
Like, I agree with you 100% agree with what you're saying.
But when we, like January and February, I realized that these altcoins are complete.
Well, I didn't realize that was always the case, but like, altcoins were complete.
Obviously, absolute trash, at least 99.99% of them.
And you start appreciating the conservatism of Bitcoin, the reliability, the reliability of it.
And the fact that it kind of moves slowly is a good thing.
But then right now, you see people who one year ago were the most rabid shit corners in the world.
And now they're coming out with the most ultra maximalist, like the most Bitcoin
ultra maximal statements on Twitter.
And honestly, I'm starting to want to buy some alts right now.
Just because like, you just want to be ahead of these people.
Like, one year from now, they'll be altcoiners again, you know.
And when, so Bitcoin is like this index of fear and greed, and it's during bear markets,
in particular, everybody's a Bitcoin maximalist.
Everything's a scam.
It's all bullshit because the only thing.
And look, when animal spirits of the bull market and the egos will wake up during the bull market
again and people's egos will get the better, better of them, try to outperform Bitcoin,
they'll all become altcoiners again.
It's just a cycle.
Exactly.
This is sort of where I think you and I agree in that I sort of diverge with tone.
Because I had the same discussion with tone saying that the altcoins aren't just
fucking going to disappear and they're not going to go away.
Yeah, dude, he thinks that altcoins are going to die.
Yeah.
Dude, that will never happen.
Yeah.
That will never happen.
Like, that's not going to happen for like five more cycles.
Yeah, as long as human beings exist and our innate ability to happen, our innate greed still
exists, we're going to try and redo this, particularly as long as the inability to understand
Bitcoin well enough exists or the ability to profit off people's inability to understand exists,
altcoins are going to exist.
Simple as that.
And you can't take that out.
You know, one thing I will say that the cycles do is that throughout it, a proportion of the
cohort that come into Bitcoin, going to altcoins, come back to Bitcoin, a proportion of them
actually stay with Bitcoin.
Although, like you said, the majority will just go through the next bull market cycle,
drop Bitcoin again, try to make a fucking quick buck and then realize.
But probably, you know, each time somebody sticks in and runs through the cycle, each time
the trust, faith and belief in Bitcoin strengthens.
And we start to build this broader base of like what we were talking about before is the right
kind of adoption, which is holding Bitcoin and accumulating Bitcoin.
And, but yeah, it's, it's, man, everything in the world just happens in cycles.
And once you sort of start to think in those terms, you realize that this is just another
one of those things that happens in beautiful cycles that if you can take yourself out of
the noise, you can, you can do so much with it.
But totally, it's, it's really investing is really, it's about waiting.
Yes.
The money is made in waiting.
It's about studying and waiting and timing is everything.
You let the opportunity come to you.
Don't expect things to happen so quickly.
Be patient.
It's funny how time just keeps coming up again, right?
Because we're talking about.
Well, time, time is the real currency.
Time is the really scariest thing.
Yeah.
Although I think humans, I think humans will transcend that as well and, and achieve immortality.
Lifely, or at least, um, or, uh, a mortality age.
Or at least, or at least life extent, significant life extension.
Yeah, yeah.
Have you heard of the term?
Have you heard of the term, a mortality instead of immortality?
Yeah, it's like, uh, you can still die, but you're not going to die of natural causes, right?
Yeah, exactly.
So, yeah.
So basically for every need, we'll do that in every year.
You can still be, you can still be killed.
Um, so, all right.
Sweet.
Um, do we want to touch on, do we want to touch on the, the graph, um, or the chart
that you built where, you know, we start off with, um, digital scarcity,
mutability and go all the way up to, you know, to account, uh, full global money?
Do, do we want to touch on that really briefly?
Um, yeah, sure.
So like, it's kind of, um, you've written a lot about this.
We've written a lot about this.
Zebode, written a lot about this.
Uh, Vijay Boiapati has written about this.
Essentially, I mean, all of these are interconnected and technically, technically.
Money is, uh, a store of value and medium of exchange and a unit of account.
Simultaneously at all times, technically, but we believe that, um, certain, uh, functions
of these, uh, they predominate during certain periods of a money's evolution.
And, uh, we also, and because these, uh, because Bitcoin isn't just a physical stone or a metal,
it's a technology, uh, which we, as a community collectively kind of guide in one way or another,
we should also prioritize search and functionalities in certain decades, so to speak.
And, um, essentially, um, Bitcoin, technically, I still think all cryptocurrencies,
they're still collectibles, technically speaking.
Of course, Bitcoin is closest to the store of value,
but I think technically all cryptocurrencies are still between the collectible and the store value
phase. You kind of want to see Bitcoin, uh, a bit bigger before I would be comfortable
calling it a full fledged, uh, fully reliable store of value.
Um, once, once it starts going to two and a half, three trillion,
we can have this discussion in a more serious tone.
But generally, the overall idea is that you start with a collectible.
you go more towards sort of a store of value
or a medium of large wealth transfer,
and then you become a medium of exchange
and subsequently you become a unit of account.
And essentially, as you grow in size,
as you grow in liquidity, as you grow in stability,
as you grow in trust, as you grow in financialization,
as you grow in institutionalization,
as you grow in cognitive global perceived reliability,
these things are going to lend themselves more
and more to be day-to-day money, day-to-day currency,
day-to-day cash.
And one day, if they are extremely stable, extremely liquid,
they can even become stable unit of accounts
or pricing mechanisms.
But these things don't happen overnight.
This is probably, we're probably only a decade in
what's probably gonna be a half a century long paradigm shift.
So we have to be patient.
And generally, we're gonna move through
these speculative cycles.
That's completely fine because short-term greed
drives the human civilization in many ways,
whether we like it or not.
But the key is that every subsequent bottom
is higher than the previous one.
And we have seen that before.
And we've seen it at 30, we've seen it at 200.
Now we're probably gonna see it at like 2,000, 3,000,
whatever, somewhere in that area, I think.
But the key, somebody put it in a very smart way.
And that's, I think, more relevant to a store of value.
First of all, as a long-term store of value,
Bitcoin has been the best ever.
That's first of all.
But don't look at the tops, look at the bottoms,
because the bottoms is what really matters.
The bottoms symbolize the hodlers.
The bottoms symbolize people who are committed.
They are symbolize the value investors
who step in at that time.
They symbolize the buyers of last resort,
and they symbolize indirectly the hodlers of last resort.
And the bottoms so far have been climbing higher and higher.
That's what really matters.
What it shows to me as an analyst
is that Bitcoin monetization,
even though it might be a little bit slower
than the crypto anarchist in us once,
it's still happening.
It's happening, and despite the wild ups and downs,
Bitcoin is steadily on its way
to becoming the digital goal of the future.
- I couldn't have said it better myself.
It is,
it's fascinating how these two concepts of trust and time
just keep coming up.
And again, I like to take a very anthropological
sort of evolutionary look at this is,
as a species we've evolved,
our survival mechanisms have evolved
from our need to trust.
And if you look at, and I don't wanna go,
I wanted to go through this today,
but I don't know if we're gonna,
if we should have enough time,
but the concept of shared fictions,
which Yuval talks about in his book "Sapiens",
and he talks about what helped us as human beings
move from being some significant,
insignificant ape out in the savannah somewhere,
to being the apex species on the planet
that now runs everything,
was our ability to hack trust.
And the way we hack trust is we create concepts
or fictions that we're able to collectively agree upon.
And then that allows us to collaborate in large numbers
because biologically, we can't have tight enough relationships
with more than 100 to 150 to 200 individuals.
And tight relationships, again,
are based on this concept or this notion of trust.
So everything that we do is based on that.
And it takes time and the systems or the fictions
or the abstractions that we collectively agree on
also take time to entrench themselves in our psyche.
And the most, the one that has lasted the longest is money,
and it's just evolved over time.
And to think that we're gonna do this somehow
in the space of 10 years,
just because we live in the technological age,
is absolutely preposterous, it's absolutely insane.
And it just shows when people try and push that argument,
it just shows their lack of understanding
of how human beings function, how society functions
and how money as an enabler of those two things
actually functions.
And I mean, that part for me,
that real evolutionary biology type area of Bitcoin,
is really closes the loop
because you start to realize how fundamentally important
it is to everything else on the planet.
And without getting that layer right,
none of the other shit matters.
And but again, that doesn't stop people along the way
or along the journey from creating whatever the fuck
they want to, which in other words, is altcoins,
based on their, like I said earlier,
lower understanding or incomplete understanding
or based on the fact that there's an opportunity
to sell to people with an incomplete understanding
because hey, like you said, greed is a part of us
and without it, we wouldn't be here.
It doesn't exist because it's like greed, for example,
people run around and say, oh, greed is bad.
It's, well, look, if it was bad
and if it was a useless part of human beings,
nature or evolution would have dropped the shit
a long time ago, but it didn't.
And it's one of those,
it's one of the things within us which drive us forward
as a society and allows us to swipe.
But anyway, I'm not gonna get into a biologic
or fucking discussion.
Let's try stick with Bitcoin.
Otherwise I'll end up on (laughs)
I'll end up on another freaking tangent here.
- Yeah, totally, I even think that
I even think that the desire for reproductive success
and that doesn't just mean immediate lust,
but quality of your partner, health of your offspring,
your offspring getting education,
everyone being well fed, et cetera.
I think that that's an even stronger force in greed.
But the competitive drives there,
they drive capitalist competition
and they drive men and women competing against one another
in providing products and services
in order to emerge as champions
of that sort of very harsh
and very hierarchical competition.
It's very Darwinian.
And I think that essentially lust and love,
they drive human progress.
- Yes, they do, they do.
- And it's totally fine.
Like, I mean, the world is a competitive place
and we have scarce resources.
So we should compete for who can sort of manipulate
the resources, manipulate these
and provide sort of superior solutions to problems better
and should be duly rewarded.
That's why my belief is that the reason
why socialist systems collapse
is because you cannot have a genius PhD person
and a janitor get paid the same money.
- No.
- Because that goes against very essence of nature.
- Exactly.
- So men need games, they need competitive sort of arenas
and capitalism works at least better than other systems
because it provides that playground,
it provides that arena for competition.
And the reason why it works
is that it creates these win-win scenarios
where people making money is ideally also the things
that are going to give the world an iPhone,
also the things that are gonna give the world a medicine,
et cetera.
And so that's how it grows.
And in socialist systems, you don't have aligned incentives
because people care about their family
more than their country.
And that's why it's a much stronger motivation.
- 100%.
I think, I wanna get into opportunity
of outcome versus opportunity of, I'm sorry,
equality of outcome versus equality of opportunity
a little bit later.
But you touch on one of the most poignant points there
is that nature by definition is competitive.
And this is actually probably a big part
of why greed as a call it an emotion
or call it whatever you wanna call it
within human beings evolved.
I do wanna say that I don't believe greed
is the strongest force, it's not.
But it's one of our survival forces.
And as a result, and this is actually another reason
why I love Bitcoin is that, you know,
if you look at nature as this system
where each component of nature or each species
and everything is working toward its own survival
which is effectively a self-centered
or a self-focused endeavor,
helps the collective prosper and continue.
And if you look at Bitcoin,
it's such an interesting microcosm
of the broader natural phenomenon
which is people around self-interest
helping strengthen the collective.
It's such an interesting analogy
that I don't think a lot of people appreciate enough is,
you know, I don't think like you said,
Satoshi created something and I don't know whether
he, she, them, they, fucking, whatever it is.
Really, I mean, if they did fathom the depth
of what this innovation was gonna evolve into
and the building blocks they put out,
then it's probably the closest thing
to a God that we've ever had, right?
But even if they didn't, it doesn't matter
because this thing has evolved as something
that is a reflection of how things evolve in nature
and it's such an interesting microcosm of it.
- And the beautiful thing is that he's not forcing us
to do it like a government or a central bank.
He just, he just proposed it.
And we are here, we're here willingly.
We're here, not because we're pushed to
but because we want to.
- We want to, yes.
And that is the most powerful, robust,
functional form of system you can have
for human beings.
- Right.
- Yeah, and where socialism as a concept falls apart
because people don't do shit 'cause they want to,
they do shit 'cause they fucking have to
and that's the wrong way to think about things
'cause you don't incent people to be the best,
you incent people to be fucking average.
- Well, you just incentivize people to take advantage
of the bureaucracy.
- Correct.
- Correct.
- Oh man, dude, I want to touch a little bit on lightning.
I just wrote a bunch of stuff on lightning
and talking about how it's effectively going
to bring more economic activity to Bitcoin,
not directly to Bitcoin but as a second layer
and subsequent layers of networks build,
what they're gonna look to do is they're gonna look to anchor
into a stable, robust, uncompromisable source of truth,
right?
And what's your thoughts on lightning?
And let's have a bit of a discussion around that.
- So I think lightning might be bigger than Bitcoin itself.
Like obviously not from like a valuation
or anything standpoint, but I think like when it's all said
and done, lightning and related technologies
will make the base layers look minimalist in comparison.
- Yep.
- And I think that like I've been studying catching up
on like neutrino and channel factories
and like all these things over the past couple of months.
And dude it's like it's gonna be like a whole nother universe.
It's extremely exciting.
- Man, I love what you just said there
because one of the big things that one of the big narratives
of last year and the year before was the fat protocol thesis
and that shit never sat right with me because it's...
- So fat protocols are essentially wrong.
- Yes.
- And even though like quote unquote protocols
are still like the bigger, the biggest market caps,
the result is coincidental.
The logic of fat protocols is completely wrong in my opinion.
And it essentially I believe said that the speculation
on DAPs that are being built on top of the protocol
is going to result in the base like protocol
on which the DAPs are built accruing the most value.
But that completely misses the point
and immediately I understand that the person didn't read
or study monetary economics ever.
They didn't consider monetary liquidity,
didn't consider store value, didn't consider inflation,
didn't consider the security properties of the system
or any of these things that are actually driving the value.
- Well, they don't even understand how systems function.
And you can't have a system that functions like that
because all you do is you, that would be the equivalent
of every time you and I, like for example,
you and I wanted to do a podcast.
We would need to go to court and say,
we're going to do a podcast.
Can you please record this somewhere
so that the fucking world knows
that we're going to do a podcast?
It's madness, absolute madness.
- Well, honestly, I don't even think that DAPs
are honestly going to be like that big.
- They're not.
At least anytime soon.
- Look, I don't even think they're going to be a thing.
I think DAPs are the dumbest idea.
- Yeah.
- I actually, my proposition is that everything.
- Are these people really that stupid?
Like DAPs aren't even going to be that big of a thing.
Like it's so obvious.
And also money is like a 10 billion times bigger
in terms of the revolution,
in terms of the things that we can achieve.
- Correct.
- And so-- - A crypto money can actually
change the world.
- Yeah.
- These DAPs, no one gives us about that.
You know what I mean?
- Look, I used to say it when I used to argue
with Ethereum people, I said, look,
you're telling me you're building an unstoppable machine here
that you can build any program on so that it runs.
Tell me how many things really need to be unstoppable.
You know, maybe, maybe--
- Yeah, exactly.
- Exactly.
- Excuse your site?
- Maybe a fucking terrorist site
and maybe a fucking drug site.
(both laughing)
- Most things are better.
I actually better centralize.
- Correct.
- Like, how many things, how many things
actually need to be hyper decentralized?
Like money, maybe like a prediction,
maybe a prediction market or something like that.
But like, and like, yeah, the criminal stuff
you talked about, but like, it's just money.
Like, you don't need to hyper decentralize everything else.
There's just completely this utter bullshit.
- Exactly.
And this is where, so where I get into lightning
and this is my argument during next week's talk,
is that I see lightning as a way to abstract security
and introduce complexity without impacting the core.
And that is the innovation of something like lightning
or second, third layer and further abstracted layers
onto something.
And this is how natural systems function anyway.
Like, when I did my first talk on lightning
about a year and a bit ago,
I used the example of thinking in first principles.
And also, I used examples of plumbing infrastructure
coming into cities.
When you have plumbing infrastructure connecting cities,
you have big, large fucking pipes that connect the city.
And then when the pipe comes into the city,
you don't have every house connecting to the fucking pipe.
You have a set of arteries and veins that split out
from the pipe to service all of the capillaries
and all of the things out in the fringes.
And the human body functions like that,
nature functions like that,
engineering functions like that,
everything functions like that.
And this network is also gonna function in the same way.
You have a layer that is functional
and gives you a guarantee of security.
Now, like you said,
we might have one, two, three, whatever,
depending on what that power looks like.
And the networks that are built on top,
which is these lightning type networks
that allow for whether it's instant payments
or instant what I like to call interactions
that involve some form of monetary components.
They will just anchor to the network
that gives them the best guarantee.
Simple as that.
And that's why I think,
and when you say lightning will probably be bigger,
I agree, I think all of the innovation
that people were talking about
and that they attributed to blockchain
to all this other stuff,
I think all of that sort of stuff
is all gonna happen on lightning.
And as a result,
I reckon that is a further,
well, a much further reason
to be bullish on something like Bitcoin,
because if we're going to build a network like lightning
where every single person
is not only a consumer of that data,
but they also produce and route
because that's how the functionality works,
they're going to want to anchor
or connect to the most indisputable,
almost robust and stable network
that sits beneath it.
And that's why I think by far, Bitcoin's gonna win.
And then you will have others
where the guarantee doesn't have to be as strong
or it might have some other small benefits to it.
But what's your thoughts on that?
- Yeah, I mean, I 100% agree with everything you just said.
- Well, that was easy.
(both laughing)
- I do think that other,
a couple of other coins are gonna have lightning to them.
- Yeah, well, again, yes, why not?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And so like I think it's interesting,
I've been thinking about like base layer competition lately.
- Yep.
- And base layer motes essentially.
And...
- And ladies and gentlemen,
we're back after some technical difficulty.
Thank you, Brisbane, Internet and Telstra for being shit.
Anyway, back to Marad, competition of base layers.
- Yeah, I think like if you very optimistically assume
that lightning network and such technologies
are going to be very interoperable
and swappable and increasingly private,
then you have to ask yourself
what the base layers will be competing,
like I go along with verticals they'll be competing in.
And I think it's gonna come down to like five things
in probably decreasing importance.
It's gonna be security, credibility of monetary policy
in a sustainable fashion.
Quality of engineers, zeal and religiosity
of the community, obviously liquidity/raw market cap size
because that like in itself is a moat.
And something I call in elasticity
of block space demand for the purposes of higher settlement,
which in simpler terms is essentially going to be
people who will be willing to pay high fees.
And it's these things that in my opinion,
the base layers are gonna be competing on.
Oh, and I think governance section.
But like all of these things,
like the devs, the community, the liquidity,
and even I would say the credibility of the monetary policy,
like those come with time.
So really just comes down to security and governance.
And I think that differentiations along these two verticals,
if I might sound a bit shit coiny for a minute,
I think differentiations along these verticals
are going to drive, are going to be like where,
like how you make money in all its essentially.
- 100%, 100%.
I think, and I mean, this is,
it's funny when I first heard you mention Decred.
And I looked at Decred a while ago and I was like,
fuck these guys, everything I listened to them
and everything I read about them,
had a relative level of intelligence
and the way they were approaching the problem
and everything I was like,
and these guys aren't fucking run-of-the-mill dumb shits.
You know, there's some brain,
and there's some logic and there's some process
and there's some, there's a method there
that sounds relatively sound.
And I never did much else with it,
like I bought a little bit of Decred like, you know,
a year ago, whatever it was, a year and a half ago.
And I just, you know, let it sit down.
I wouldn't even have a clue what the price of it is today.
But when I heard you mention it, I was like,
hmm, maybe I was onto something
'cause I never really looked into it deeper,
but before I ask you about Decred,
'cause I wanna talk about a couple of yolts,
I just wanna tie off this lightning thing
with a couple of things.
So it's super relevant, actually,
because the little-known fact,
the code that's used in lightning a demon
is code that Dave Collins from Decred wrote,
like five years ago.
And that code, which is BTC Suite,
which was a full-node implementation of Bitcoin and Go,
which they worked for three years
before even starting Decred.
That's like the basis of LND.
And that's also the basis of a lot of Ethereum stuff as well.
So it's like, the reason I bring this up
is because two reasons.
Decred devs are like really high quality.
And two, they worked on Bitcoin itself
for three years before even starting their alt.
And three, I am so bullish on lightning network
that it will become such an important thing
of such strategic importance for the spaces as a whole
and for any chain that I think Decred will be an important coin
because it's going to have lightning natively.
Like they're actually building lightning
onto all the software itself.
- Yeah, yeah. - It's going to be like,
it's going to be like right inside the core software,
which I think is like super cool.
- Yes. - So yeah.
- So in other words, what you're saying is that if lightning,
so if the theory or the thesis around lightning
taking off and being something,
it will also lift something like Decred
because of the way they are capable for it, correct?
Is that what you're saying, yeah?
- Yeah, I think the, like people talk about
how like all the odds will have lightning,
that's not true at all.
It's actually kind of complicated to like build it
on top of the base layer.
And like Decred people like build the code
for like years back.
And so I think they'll probably be like the second chain to have.
I mean, Litecoin already has it,
but I don't consider Litecoin
to be a credible store of value contender at all
because it essentially has no differentiation.
It does nothing that Bitcoin cannot do.
So to me, it's completely irrelevant.
I'm bullish on Decred because it does like six things differently.
And I really like them.
- Yeah, yeah, all right.
So last thing about lightning or maybe two things.
I've got a question here that I wrote,
is will the next generation of users be on Bitcoin
or on lightning or is it too early?
So I guess this sort of ties back to the idea
of cohorts and cycles is,
I'm a big believer that in future,
people won't be talking about buying Bitcoin
or possibly they're going to be buying Satoshis
primarily is particularly as the network value increases
because you know.
- Totally, totally.
I think Satoshis are actually going to be the currency.
Bitcoin is just like a huge bundle of them.
- Yes, yes, so do you think,
which cycle do you think we're going to start
to see that inflection point happening
where the vernacular and the language moves
from talking about Bitcoin to talking about Satoshis?
Do you think that's next cycle?
Do you think it's a cycle after that
or the one after that?
What's your thoughts?
- Probably like at least two cycles from now.
- Two cycles from now, okay.
Then that--
- Well, you need a higher Bitcoin price
and two more lightning penetration.
Okay.
So in your mind, what sort,
and I'm not asking you to be Nostradamus here,
is in your mind what sort of Bitcoin price
or Bitcoin network value you're thinking
is going to start to make sense for the language
to change towards Satoshi and lightning?
- Sorry, you cut out there for a second.
- I was thinking in your mind,
so not asking you to be Nostradamus,
but in your mind, at what Bitcoin price
or Bitcoin network value,
do you anticipate Satoshi's becoming the thing
that we discuss or that we interact with?
- Like 300K and up.
- 300K and up, okay.
All right, that's a bit higher than what I was expecting.
Okay.
So at that stage,
you think we'll be well and truly into,
it's all about buying Satoshi's.
Do you think the inflection point is a little bit earlier,
or do you think that is actually where the inflection point is?
- Yeah, I mean, once you have the higher base Bitcoin price
and lightning actually starting to get used for,
so 'cause like lightning starting to actually get used
for like payments and commercial stuff,
like that's when the Satoshi's will start being relevant.
'Cause even today, like you see all the lightning
Twitter people, they essentially only speak in Satoshi's.
They don't even bring a bit kinds of,
which is, that's already kind of a microcosm of what's to come.
But I think it might take a bit longer than you think
because like for example,
I like even as cool as lightning is,
I'm not really gonna use it for like 10 years
because I'm not spending, I'm not spending Bitcoin at all.
(laughing)
- Well, the reason I'm laughing is because
at that meetup that I was mentioned earlier,
you know, there was a guy in the front row who was from EOS
and you know, during question time, holy crap,
we got into a bit of a heated argument because he goes,
oh, you know, this Bitcoin thing is just stupid.
It still doesn't have adoption.
I'm sick and tired of people talking about Bitcoin.
You know, at EOS we've got adoption.
We've got Instagram models talking about it.
I was like, Jesus Christ,
that's this guy's definition of adoption.
Like fucking these guys have gone completely off the rail.
- Well, my hope is that, my hope is that,
and this is kind of cynical of me,
but my hope is that with every cycle,
the median IQ of the space will keep improving
because institutions and ultra-hynet worth individuals
will play a bigger role than they have versus retail
in the past.
And the world is structured in a way
where essentially like 200 people,
they own everything and they're not dumb.
And so they'll be investing in the right thing.
- Yeah, yeah, well.
- So it doesn't matter.
So it doesn't matter what idiots are seeing
because the idiots have no money anyway.
And the people who do have money, they at least think,
or statistically, they're more likely to be smarter.
And so they will do, they will have their 50 analysts
actually study everything on a mathematical level
before making any serious decisions
rather than just like talking about using the shit.
- Yeah, I agree with you.
'Cause like the reason I laughed at the guy was,
'cause he said, you know, you guys don't have any adoption
and talk to me about lightning
'cause nobody's using it.
And I said, I hope, I said,
I didn't give a fuck about lightning being used.
And why I'm laughing is that I also said 10 years.
I said, I don't care if lightning
doesn't get used for another 10 years.
I said, that doesn't matter.
It's not the game we're playing.
He's like, 10 years, what kind of adoption is that?
That's when you're gonna drink the little Instagram model around.
And it's just funny how some of us just think
in just that longer term horizon.
It's just, it's insane.
But anyway, so timeframe.
Next final question on lightning is,
one of the arguments I gave about lightning
a little while back was that building infrastructure
such as it makes the entire system more robust
because it introduces incentives outside of just mining.
And then what it does is it brings skin in the game
for people who aren't just miners.
So what you end up is a multi-layer type of guarantee
in a system where more people are vested in its success.
So I don't know if I'm articulating that as well,
but what are your thoughts on adding a layer inside of it?
- Because you can make money with the hubs
or because more from like an engineering standpoint.
- Maybe both, but more so from the money from the hubs
because one of the components of what I love about lightning
is that being a part of the lightning network,
you're not just doing payments,
but you're also facilitating payments.
So as a result, you'll be coming part of the network
and you've also got a little bit of skin in the game
in the network.
So what's your thoughts there?
- Yeah, totally.
I don't think that people will make that much money routing
because it's going to become like an insanely competitive market.
But I think for the time being, yeah,
I've heard theories that the techniques to actually optimize
like the channel liquidity management and all those things
actually are required some sophistication at the moment.
So maybe some money in fees will be made
for like the first five, six years of it.
But then I think they're going to become this whole thing
is going to become increasingly competitive.
- Yeah.
Okay, maybe I did not articulate that as well.
So whilst I agree with that,
I think the point that I was making really goes back to the talk
that I gave bloody over a year and a bit ago
was if we wanted to build a network
and the only form of validation and check was purely miners,
I don't think that's as robust as a network
that separates or gives you multiple layers of validation.
And the validation on the lightning network
is slightly different.
Like so it's got its own level of game theory
and validation that occurs up there
that is linked to the base layer.
So I believe a multi-layer infrastructure
gives you actually as a whole more security
than sticking with just one layer with just miners.
So maybe that's sort of the point that I was trying to make there.
- I think honestly, I think that applies to,
I mean, the exact argument that you're making
is much stronger applied to Decred than lightning
because in Decred, you have Stakers approving miners work,
actual direct security.
But lightning itself,
like it doesn't really affect the security of the base chain.
- Yep.
- But I guess it, I would say lightning contributes
to security of the base layer
if it increases like the economic activity
by like two orders of magnitude potential.
And then and then like Jevon's paradox style,
you are going to,
even though you're going to get a lot of efficiency,
you're going to get even more demand.
So the total fees are going to be even greater than today.
Like that's kind of an argument
that I've heard people make.
- Yep.
- But in and of itself,
lightning doesn't really increase the security of your money.
- Okay, interesting.
I articulated that one poorly.
I'll, I'm going to tweet.
- Yeah.
- I'm going to send that to you as a message in a,
- So, so I hope my Bitcoin ultra-maximus friends
don't hear this,
but I actually think that hybrid-proof-of-work-proof-of-stake
is more secure than proof-of-work.
- Well, 'cause you, 'cause you're adding layers
and then that sort of--
- Well, you're adding layers, like a, well,
an attacker would have to buy 51% of the hash rate
and 51% of the coins,
which is like, essentially, essentially impossible.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
- And imagine, well, the thing is that like,
the problem with Bitcoin is that like,
I mean, this might never become an issue,
but just hypothetically,
it's security only comes from aggregate fees,
assuming all coins have been minted.
But with the coins with a proof-of-stake component
added on top, you are defended by the aggregate fees
and you're also defended by the market tap.
So if, say, something like Bitcoin is going to be one trillion
and then declared is going to be one trillion,
then declared would be like 25 times more expensive to attack.
- Yep, yep.
- And it's also more secure on an intra-block basis
because essentially, in secret,
things like selfish mining or fee sniping
or block space censorship,
they're much harder to pull off by miners
because if they do that, they don't get any fees
or they don't get any reward
because the stakers need to approve every single block.
Essentially, I don't know.
Like, I think that it's something to study, at least, for sure.
- It is, and you touch on there,
the whole proof-of-stake thing is there is a school of thought
which you could, which almost places
something like lightning or a second layer technology,
almost, you could almost define it as a form of
or a light form of proof-of-stake.
- Yeah, it kind of is because, yeah, definitely.
I've heard that metaphor.
- Yeah, so in that sort of, I think you help me
just flesh it out there is that by combining a network
that functions a little bit more like proof-of-stake
with proof-of-work, the whole becomes overall more secure.
But like you said, that argument then applies
for something like Decred having a more robust nature
by combining it.
- Well, yeah, because by your own logic,
Decred is actually gonna have three
because it's gonna have proof-of-work, proof-of-stake,
and lightning.
So it's like all these layers, you know?
And probably more.
- Good point, good point, good point.
- And imagine when you add like layer three,
like Margin Dale's fabric or channel factories
on top of it all, which is gonna, it's like a whole,
it's like a whole nother, dude, it's very sci-fi.
- Yeah, man, it's fucking cool.
Well, I mean, that was gonna be,
my next part of the thing was gonna be Decred.
So we've talked about a bunch of stuff in Decred.
We just touched on another thing.
Is there anything else you wanna tell people about Decred?
- Yeah, I kind of like people say,
a lot of people have superficial understanding of it,
but I really like it's governance.
Because you, like you vote on everything
that happens in Decred from the smallest kind of,
from the smallest tweak to the biggest on-chain,
collect serious consensus change.
And the people who are allowed to vote
are those who are willing to stake their coins
or essentially lock them up for somewhere
between one and five months.
And I think this is really powerful
because the people who get to make decisions
are those who have their actual wealth tied up
in the system for an unspecified
and deliberately randomized period of time.
And essentially, like if your wealth is tied up,
you really, you start really, really caring about it
because the illiquidity really makes you care about
A, maintaining the security of the system,
but B, also for the coin price to go up.
And of course, it's a much more experimental
than Bitcoin sort of rough like shelling point consensus.
But I think this should be explored
and I think at the very least, it has potential.
- Yeah, interesting.
So I like Decred because if you sit down
and think about how basically I should compete,
the intrinsically, it's just the security model
and the governance model and Decred is powerful
because it does both differently,
not just one of them, but both.
- Yeah, yeah.
So what's, I mean,
I'm gonna get burned by my Bitcoin friends here
for even having this conversation.
- Yeah, same, but I don't care.
- Yeah.
- Like I'm, here's the thing, right?
Like I need to admit this,
like I care about making money more
than I care about any particular coin.
Like that's just my truth.
So, and if I know that we still have like a couple more
of these crazy cycles
and illiquid altcoins will outperform,
then, and like I've done the,
I've done the statistical analysis, I've done it at all.
And I know that like this is likely gonna happen.
Then I'm like, it would be irrational for me
not to take advantage of it.
- Absolutely, absolutely.
So what's your one of the, one of the arguments that,
and I'm just gonna play devil's advocate here on Decred
is, you know everyone's got how many XA hash now
worth of compute power behind it?
Do you know how much Decred has on a?
- I don't know the exact number,
but it's gone 500 X in the last year.
- 500 X, okay.
And how does that compare to sort of Bitcoin's trajectory?
- You can't, you can't, it's hard to compare
because they are different algorithms,
which would like completely different mathematics.
- Yeah, okay.
- But the hashing algorithms are different.
But essentially it's exploding as we speak.
It's already up 250% since the beginning of the year.
- 250.
- It was 500 X, it was 500 X in 2018,
and it's 260% this year.
- Okay, interesting.
And because it's a different algorithm,
so is the market through which we're measuring Decred's,
I guess, overall hashing power,
it's different.
So we're not just gonna say it's got XA hash
the same way as we say for Bitcoin, is that correct?
- Yeah, I don't even look at hash rate.
Just look at cost of attack.
That's what really matters.
- Yeah, cost of attack, all right.
Okay, and that's where, so that's where you're at.
- The thing about this,
the thing about this like the hybridizing,
so I actually hate pure proof of stake.
I don't think it's gonna work.
- Of course, yeah, it's funny.
- Well, I don't think those chains
are going to become global stores of value.
- No.
- But the beauty of hybrid proof of stake
is that it doesn't suffer from any
of the problems of pure proof of stake.
So, you know, like weak subjectivity,
nothing at stake, randomness issues, oligarchy,
none of those are an issue in hybrid proof of stake,
because it's still rooted in electricity,
and proof of stake is only added
after the miners have proposed the blocks,
and it's only added as like a second layer,
you know what I mean?
- Yep.
- So, it's still technically rooted in proof of work,
and proof of work on miners receive 60% of the blocker word,
which also solves the oligarchy stuff
because the proof of stake people get continuously diluted,
which they don't in pure proof of stake.
- Yes.
- There's no randomness issues
because it's still based in proof of work caching
and electricity.
And last but not least,
there's no weak subjectivity either,
because once again, it's rooted in the electricity
as opposed to having people tell you
like what's the right chain, right?
And essentially, yeah, I'm bullish.
I think the beauty of this is that
it's one of those like one plus one
equals eight type situations, you know?
Decorate only needs to be like 7% the size of Bitcoin
to be as secure,
which I think is gonna be powerful.
- Interesting.
- And I think that the stakers can be far more deep.
Like the staking layer can be far more decentralized.
- In the mining layer, yeah.
- Then the mining layer.
And in Decorate, you have both,
which is like, it's kind of like,
it's multiplicatory, you know what I mean?
- Yeah.
What about the argument that, you know,
- And I would also add,
and this mathematics that I mentioned,
that's without adding the illiquidity issues,
which is what I'm trying to say is,
if anyone even tries to buy,
I'm not even talking about 51%.
If anyone even tries to buy like 20, 25% of the coins,
with every couple of percents that they buy,
they push the price so much higher
than every additional 2% that they're trying to buy,
is gonna be more and more and more expensive.
- Yeah.
- And this in itself,
this in itself as acts as a security, you know?
That's on top of the 23 X in security
that you get from hybridization, you know what I mean?
- Yeah.
So it's super, super secure.
- What's your thoughts on, you know,
when networks, when networks take off,
particularly when networks have a superiority
around one function.
So for example, you know,
Bitcoin is the most immutable, you know,
network on the face of the planet.
In fact, it's the only digital network that I know of,
where we can't turn back time, where it costs,
and the immutability is a function of that cost.
So therefore, it's kind of like real life.
We can't turn back time.
Now, for any application that requires that, you know,
and money being one of those applications
is the ability to have a final settlement.
You know, when networks start to take off and, you know,
run away, you know, the, you know,
the idea that, you know, the power law
is going to be even more pronounced, you know,
in a network as such, that is supposed to be, you know,
and I guess what I'm saying is Bitcoin,
and I heard Andreas say this, and it was really nice,
is Bitcoin's proof of work, you know,
it's significant now, because in the beginning,
it was insignificant.
And in other words, it's like,
it's too late to catch now.
So it crossed that inflection point.
And if you wanted to go and compete with Bitcoin
and try and buy up all the mining equipment, you know,
you would basically chase it asymptotically to infinity.
So it's sort of like the cat side of the bag
and we can't chase it because we gave it the opportunity
in the first place.
And that was just purely due to everyone's dismissal
of it as a phenomenon.
Now, Bitcoin got that because it was lucky
and it's already taken off.
You know, do you think, how do you think
you'd decret act in that sort of environment
in the sense that, you know, there's all eyes on it now?
So, you know, is there an opportunity to potentially,
is it, has it crossed the point of
too hard to shut down?
Or do you think it's still in the early stages?
Where do you think it is?
I think in one or two more bull markets, it'll be there.
- One or two, okay, cool.
And all right, so now I'm gonna tie the pieces together.
So in other words, because we're gonna have multiple bull markets
and this broader concept of cryptos, you know, out of the bag,
there is gonna be more capital coming in in total.
And as a result, some things that are gonna get extra capital
on the side whilst, you know, Bitcoin is probably gonna,
you know, assume the lion's share of it,
they're, by definition, gonna increase the network value
and cross that threshold of no return
because of, you know, the speculative fervor
that's gonna come across the next cycles, correct?
- Yes, but I like to invest in things I genuinely believe
in fundamentally for the long term, actually.
And even though we're, of course, I'm speculating,
I think declared will become a Bitcoin hedge.
- Okay, anything else other than Bitcoin and Decred?
- No.
- No, not even Monero?
- No, it's overhyped.
- Yep, okay.
- Privacy is not enough to compete.
- Okay, cool, interesting.
So--
- And I don't actually, I don't believe,
I don't believe the chances should be fully private.
I believe credibility of monetary policy
is more important than complete privacy.
And you want the money supply to be always
at all times fully verifiable.
- Yeah, yeah.
- That's the number one driver of the entire value
of the E systems.
- Yep.
- And also both base layers and lagging layers
are going to be increasingly private as well.
And also if you essentially sit down on a table
and write the top 20 aspects or criteria
that make the store a value.
- Yeah, sure, Monero, ZK or whatever,
they might be superior to Bitcoin in one of them,
which is privacy slash fungibility.
But Bitcoin is just so far ahead in the other 19
that it's not enough, like Bitcoin plus privacy
is not enough to be Bitcoin, like that will never happen.
These engineers, they don't understand
that how important monetary liquidity is,
how important these sort of more financial monetary dynamics are.
It's just going to be an uphill battle.
It's not enough, I'm not bullish.
- Interesting.
Look, here's the thing, like on-chain privacy,
on-chain throughput and on-chain programability,
they are decoys.
They are decoys to scam people and to make money.
They're not the value drivers.
Value drivers are security assurances,
guarantees and low inflation.
That's the true value drivers.
- Very nicely put.
I actually want to put that in the show notes later as yes.
My thoughts on the privacy thing is,
I think if you bake it in,
where Monero is trying to bake it in,
is you'll end up with a problem that broadly,
it won't be the financial network
upon which everything's built
because it's prioritizing the wrong piece.
Like you just said, it's not prioritizing the security
and the visibility of the monetary policy
versus trying to run the privacy.
But in saying that, I would posit
that there is going to be a bunch of applications
where, again, maybe Monero and Ethereum can work together,
is that Ethereum can be the place
where you build the network where terrorists can hire people
and you can pay them the Monero
so that no one can tell it through
and find out where the money came from.
- Yeah, even if you look at it,
so here's the thing, like, if Monero and Zcash,
if they don't become,
if they don't get a monetary premium
and if they don't become store of values in their own right,
they just risk becoming glorified mixers
to put money in, wander money
and get money out back into Bitcoin, you know what I mean?
And so even if you look at dark markets today,
like people use Bitcoin like four times as much
as they use Monero or whatever, or even more,
which shows to me that liquidity
is more important than privacy.
- That's such a good point.
It also could be that people using dark markets,
you know, probably a large proportion of them,
don't fucking understand
and they probably still think that Bitcoin's private
and they're wondering why the Fed is knocking
on their door after they.
- Well, totally.
The second and third world countries
probably can't even track this tech anyway,
even if it's transparent for now.
- Interesting.
All right.
Non-vungible tokens and collectibles,
what's your thoughts around that?
Not specifically premium, but broadly.
- I think they might become a thing,
but personally, I'm unexcited.
I'm not ever gonna buy something like that.
- Yep, cool, cool.
All right.
Do you want to add anything to that?
- There's probably, but I said the same
about like video games.
I'm not really a gamer, but there's people who,
like, we need to be self-aware
in our understanding that not everyone
in the world is like us.
- Yes.
- So who knows?
Maybe that's gonna be a two trillion dollar market
or all the digital arts and stuff,
but that's not like, that's not my thing.
- Yeah, yeah.
Well, I, you know, I'm not a gamer personally.
I'm not a bunch of a collector,
but yeah, if I look at Bitcoin and again,
if we think about it at its very essence,
it's effectively a collectible and...
- Yes.
- The scarcity thesis suggests that
if we can create digital objects
that, you know, whether they're artwork
or whether they're fucking tokens or games
or whatever, you know, non-fungible objects,
I do actually think there's gonna be, you know,
some form of market there,
not that I'm gonna personally be a participant,
but I mean, I didn't predict Snapchat,
but guess what, you know, there's millions of users.
So it's just, like you said, it's one of those things,
you know, if we have our own biases
and I think there's enough money to be made in Bitcoin itself
and to worry about that,
but I think it will be a thing that would be my guess,
although like you, not a big area of interest for me.
- I like, I like, like money competition
and payment stuff, that's what I like.
- Yep.
The next thing that I've got on here
is just a quick touch on market outlook,
you know, just talking about this year, next year,
the hardening, you know,
what sort of the next cycle's gonna look like.
Dude, you're a legend with this sort of stuff,
so I'll let you sort of talk us through, you know,
your, what you're envisioning, you know,
for this year and moving forward.
- No bull market until the middle of 2020.
- Sweet.
There it is.
(laughing)
- I reckon we can just leave it at that.
(laughing)
- No, my, so I'm starting a fund whose specialization
is on-chain analytics.
- Yep.
- We study what's happening on the chain,
like the addresses, wallets, exchanges, miners,
pools, volume, momentum, different kinds of like a thing,
a bunch of things we invented
that I can send you some material on,
but essentially it's not looking good right now.
- Yep.
- Yeah, and I agree with you.
I don't have the same level of tools or analysis or time
because I'm busy building a fucking startup,
but having been, I've been in market since I was in uni,
actually, this is 19 years old, so it's 12 years now.
And I think people don't appreciate how long winters last
and people think, and again, this is just a sign of,
people who've never been in markets,
who've never traded, who've never been anywhere near
any of this stuff, for the first time in history,
have come to a casino called Crypto,
and they think now that it's fallen,
it's gonna skyrocket back up.
And that's just not how shit works.
You know, the human psyche and collectively, particularly,
takes time to forget something,
or it takes time for it to become numb.
So even if I don't look at any of the tools or any
of the stuff that you guys have developed,
which substantiate this claim,
is I just think, people aren't bored of it yet.
The only time this is actually gonna turn around
is that when the washout, you know, completes,
and that takes time, it takes time for people to realize
that, hey, shit, I could've been doing something else,
so if I could, I'm just gonna leave this for now,
and I'm gonna go do something else,
before, you know, the price really hits the bottom.
So what's your thoughts on that?
- I think we'll bottom in the next three months.
- Okay.
And do you think that we might--
- But we'll have one year of flatness afterwards.
- Okay, yep.
And that bottom in process,
'cause that was gonna be my next question,
is this flatness or the sideways movement, you know,
again, I think that takes time,
because it takes time for, you know,
stuff to accumulate again.
This bottom in process over the next three months,
four months, five months, six months,
call it whatever it's gonna be.
Do you think that's gonna tumble,
like, so do you think that it's gonna be sharp
toward the end, or what's your thoughts there?
- Yeah, I think it's going to be quite sharp,
for maybe a bit less sharp than 2015,
because we are simply have more liquid markets now.
But, yeah, we need to see that final capitulation,
that high red volume, those wicks,
and just sort of that fear and panic,
because I would argue it's a good thing,
because you can think of it as a form of cleansing
and rebirth, and coins would obviously get transferred
from the weak and the impatient and the short-termist,
to the long-term-minded and the patient and the strong hands.
And that's actually going to build a strong foundation
for the next cycle,
because the people who buy those levels
aren't going to sell those those anymore,
and they would restrict the supply between that level,
and sort of a far away from there,
which is essentially healthy for Bitcoin's price.
- Exactly, each time that the,
I like to call it like a thermostat.
The thermostat rises during each cycle,
and we might come back to the thermostat,
but it's at a higher market than it was before.
- Right, right.
- Perfectly agree.
So, in this next cycle,
who do you think is the next adopter?
So, some people think that it's going to be
the retail market, some people say it's the early majority,
some people say it's the institution,
some people say, who in your mind,
what does the next cohort look more like?
- Institutions and the high network individuals.
- Okay, okay.
And what do you think is going to be the method
through which they start to acquire this stuff?
Do you think it's going to be,
they're going to go to the Fidelis to the world
and do that, or they're going to jump on finance
and, you know, buy some BTC, what do you think they're doing?
- Definitely more of the former than the latter.
OTC and custodians and some of the financial products
that will come up.
- Yeah.
What's your thoughts about it?
- There's a joke among my friends
that goes something like,
the Yale endowment isn't going to be bidding up
your shit-corn on Binance.
(laughing)
- Yes, yes.
So true.
- Yeah, look, I tend to agree with you.
My, I was on a podcast again the other week
talking about, you know, cohorts that are coming in.
I also think that
over when the next cycle starts to run away again,
I think we're going to start to see, you know,
broader retail market in the form of an early majority
start to get involved.
You know, I think that's going to sort of be an area.
But, you know, that's not going to be happening
for another, you know, 12, 18 months,
that usually comes when the train starts to really take off,
which, you know, again, is, I mean,
that's going to be a huge marketplace.
And I think that's going to help
with the broader overall perception of Bitcoin,
but, you know, at the end of the day,
the major capital that's going to be stored on the network
is going to come from, like you said,
the high net worth, Cesar, Cesar, which is,
where, I mean, that when somebody hears
that a major university, for example, has, you know,
bought up some Bitcoin, that in itself
is going to add layers of trust
and is going to help bring more capital into the system.
And that's the recursive effect that, you know,
larger institutions and larger players have,
as opposed to, if you heard that your friend
around the corner bought some Bitcoin,
that's not going to really, you know,
give you any reason to trust and put your own capital into it.
So I think, you know, the importance
of the sophisticated cohort coming in is underestimated,
I think, by the general populace.
And I think it's something that, you know,
you're one of the rare people actually talk about it
and say it as it is.
- Right.
- Yeah, I think that's definitely an important area.
So is there anything else you want to add to the outlook,
you know, and the cycles and, you know, anything like that?
- Yeah, we need more chain usage.
We need more people coming into sort of
for investment purposes.
We need for the price to, ideally,
for the price to go a little bit lower
and for the onshin volume to go a little bit higher,
in my opinion.
And yeah, we need, essentially,
we need people to think that Bitcoin is dead
or Bitcoin is dying.
We want the ownership of this asset
to be owned by people who are committed forever, essentially.
And the people who are here for extremely short-term issues,
we actually want them gone.
And I think you will see that happen.
I might be wrong, but I lean 70%
that capitalization is still to come.
And I think it's going to come this spring.
- Okay, spring on which side of the world?
Your side, right?
- Yeah, I think April, April, May or June.
- Yeah, okay, cool, cool, cool.
Do you have any ideas?
Would you like to speculate on what the trigger might be?
Or you don't care to make such guesses?
- So I actually don't believe in triggers.
I think that people like to assign narratives to things,
but really, I think it's things like time,
things like price exhaustion,
things like attention exhaustion
and simply the continuation of the trend.
Like people like to say, bull markets end
not because of some kind of news.
Bull markets end when there's no more buyers.
Similarly, bear markets end when there's no more sellers.
So what we need is for the sellers to go away.
And that's far more important than any one piece of news.
Frankly, I don't think any news in particular
is going to suddenly reverse this market at the moment.
- Yeah, very nicely put.
I think the time and the attention thing,
here's that time concept coming up again, right?
But yeah, like I said, the attention is
people just need to get bored with it or sick of it
or think that there's more opportunity elsewhere.
And it's those guys by their very nature of going away
who don't believe it or get it that are going to leave.
But what we've done through this cycle
is that the number of true believers has grown
and the next cycle is going to do the same thing.
The next cycle is going to do the same thing.
And it's just, I mean, it's so much like nature, right?
It's just cycles happen, you have an over exacerbation,
you have a cleansing, you have an over,
doing you have a cleansing and things just move
in the cycles, everything functions like that.
- Last things I wanted to touch on is,
we spoke a little bit earlier about,
so this is non-Bitcoin topics,
but we spoke a little bit earlier
about, you know, socialist and, you know,
versus capitalist and, you know,
how the incentives are malaligned in a socialist
sort of infrastructure because what you're doing is,
you're, and I think this is an important point
for people to realize is,
just because you don't incentivize something
doesn't mean you're not disincentivizing
something at the back end.
So for example, you know, one of the issues I have
with, you know, equality of outcome, for example,
is you might not be necessarily, you know,
you might be trying in your naive sort of frame of mind
to make it better for everybody,
but in the process of making it better for everybody,
like you said, the janitor versus the nuclear physicist,
what you're doing is you're actually disincentivizing
the nuclear physicist, you're putting a burden on them
and you're discounting them
by trying to even out this concept of, you know,
equality of outcome.
So, you know, did you wanna elaborate any further around
what we were talking about, you know, earlier?
- Well, yeah, first of all, I totally agree.
Like, if you make it easy for them,
like people grow through the struggle
as cold as it sounds, you know what I mean?
Or you need to, in order to grow, you need to overcome.
- Yep.
- That's fundamentally, but I would even push your argument
to even another level to say that, honestly,
I don't believe in equality, period.
- Absolutely.
- I don't think people are equal.
In any way at all.
And I actually think that inequality
is a natural fabric or reality.
- Yep.
- And I actually think it's even desirable
because nature wants the best man and the best woman
to reproduce and to create the next superior generation
of human genome.
- Nature requires differentiation,
not fucking equality.
- Totally, yeah.
- Totally, totally.
And no, nature wants us to compete
so that, and I'm not talking literally,
dying, but metaphorically, dying to a competition,
they want us strong to survive
and then to weak to be weeded out.
And that's cycled to continue again and again and again.
I think that actually inequality and competition,
they drive growth.
- Correct.
- They're completely, they're completely acceptable.
- Absolutely.
- I think the beauty of Bitcoin is that
- It magnifies.
- Well, it gives the 99% a money
that allows them to preserve the fruits
of their labor over time
and makes the tantalum effects manufactured
by the financial elite among the 1% obsolete.
But it also gives the 1% an asset
that is completely inaccessible to the seizure
by a potential populist uprising of the 99%.
And to me, this is monetary freedom and monetary justice
and it goes both ways and it's a fair win-win.
And I think it will be demanded
by both the rich and the poor alike.
- Oh man, that is so fucking good.
You know what, that is the light bulb moment for me today
is that it's so true.
Both sides of the equation,
it solves an incredible problem for both sides
'cause yeah, that's like, yeah, well,
you saw, I'm assuming you obviously saw the stupid thing
that's going around now in America.
It's about, you know, oh, let's take the money
from the billionaires or whatever it is, like some.
- Well, I actually, I, as a Bitcoin holder,
I kind of want to vote for that
so that people just buy Bitcoin.
- Yeah.
- I want them to succeed.
I want them to succeed so that they collapse the system.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Oh man, that is such a, such a true point
because, yeah, I hope that, I hope that sinks in.
- It's inescapable, it's going to happen.
It's just a matter of time.
- Yeah.
- We are, we're like 15 years early.
- Yeah, we are, exactly.
And we're gonna have to butt our heads
against the wolf in 15 years.
- But it's gonna be exciting.
We are going to have a, we're going to have an exciting youth
and an exciting life.
- Well, man, it's, yeah, look, like we were saying before,
is, you know, Bitcoin is not only, you know,
some form of new money, but it's this entirely,
it's a beautiful representation in, you know,
digital form in this, of how nature has functioned
and evolved over time, and it's now giving us an opportunity
to do some really cool shit and reinvent,
maybe not reinvent society,
but I think take the elements that function
and bring them into a part of the world
that has really only developed over the last 20, 30 years,
which is this, you know, digital software
is eating the world type thing is, you know,
in that world, you know, the laws of physics
haven't functioned very well in that world.
And Bitcoin bridges the real world
and the ephemeral digital world
and brings some of those laws of physics into it,
you know, for it to function better.
So, anyway, that's another tangent,
but yeah, I love your point about, you know, inequality
being absolutely fundamentally important
to humanity, to society, and to everything that we hold dear
because it's necessary.
It's 100% necessary and required.
And I always have this battle with people again,
you know, with people say, oh, you know,
I've always said this since I was younger,
is I believe in fairness.
I have no fucking time for equality
because equality is a insult or a slap in the face
to somebody trying to do more
versus somebody who doesn't give a shit.
Whereas fairness, in fact, I would say it's also fair
for inequality to exist because it would be unfair
for everything to be equal.
So people need to take a fucking side here,
they need to choose to either believe in what's fair
and what's right, or to believe in some veneer
of an ideology that suggests that shit's equal
in any way, shape or form.
- Well, the interesting thing is that
Jordan Peterson even talks about this.
He says that even if you had a government
that made everybody get the exact same salary
where the exact same clothes
and even have the exact same looks and bodies.
- Yep.
- People would still figure out some kind of a game
to compete and to create hierarchies
because we have a collective demand for inequality.
- 100%, 100%.
I actually Jordan was in Brisbane on the weekend
so I went and saw him.
- Oh, nice.
- Yeah, it was really good.
- I'm on the fact.
- He finished on that whole premise about,
I mean, Jordan's one of the most eloquent talkers
when it comes to discussing hierarchies,
the importance of hierarchies
and how absolutely ludicrous it is to think
that we don't have hierarchies
or that we don't have inequality
as part of a functional system.
Like, I mean, the way I always say it is
that if everything was equal, nothing would actually exist.
You know, if you wanna go find equality,
go out into the depths of space somewhere
where there's no fucking stars or galaxies
or anything anywhere near in the complete
out of vacuum of space, you have equality.
Other than that, nothing else is equal.
I'm sorry.
That's not how--
- Totally, hey, from a planetary level
all the way down to solar level.
That was just the way it is.
- Exactly, exactly.
Sweet man.
Dude, is there, I think we'll wrap it up here
because I'm gonna assume it's like 4 o'clock
in the morning or getting close to 5 o'clock
in the morning over there.
We could talk for ages,
but is there any other key things
that you wanna mention before we wrap this up?
- No, man, just wanted to thank you for inviting me.
This was a very nice and pleasant conversation.
- I understand, dude.
I've really enjoyed it.
Since the first time we had a quick chat on Twitter,
I've been looking forward to us having this conversation.
And I think A, we need to definitely do it again.
But I'll put your Twitter stuff on the show notes.
We get it out.
I'll send you the link so that way we can get it to everyone.
I think this is a really important, broad episode
for everyone listening here to go and share
and to spread out to other people as well,
because I think it's the concepts and notions
that we discussed here are really, really important.
Is there anything that you wanna talk about
with respect to the fun that you're raising?
Is there any reason people to contact you about that
or is that still something that you're working on
that's your thing?
- Yeah, we just actually started fundraising this month.
- Okay.
- You can reach me at info@adaptivecapital.co.
And of course, if that's easier,
you can always message me on Twitter.
My DMs are open as well.
- Sweet.
All right, my man.
Again, thank you so much.
Really enjoyed it.
And we will do this again,
maybe in six months or something.
- Perfect, and I'm looking forward to it.
- Cheers, bro.
