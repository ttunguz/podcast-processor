- Hosts and their backgrounds/roles:
David Lee Kim, Co-founder of Omniscient Digital

- Guests and their roles/backgrounds:
Senuka Karunaratne, Co-founder and CEO of Daydream (platform to automate programmatic SEO end-to-end). Previously founded Flix which used programmatic SEO to refer subscribers to streaming companies. Also was an Entrepreneur in Residence at Hustle Fund and Chief of Staff to COO at Pango (cybersecurity company).

- Featured company overview: 
Daydream is a venture-backed company automating programmatic SEO end-to-end. Senuka's previous company Flix was a bootstrapped company doing lead generation for streaming companies using programmatic SEO.

2. KEY INSIGHTS
- The way companies reach users through search is fundamentally changing due to AI advancements. Google is adapting with SGE while also being challenged by new AI-powered search experiences. Optimizing for search will expand beyond just Google to include alternatives.
"I think the way companies will reach users through search is just changing on two very foundational levels. So one is the place that people take their search queries to and the way that those questions are served is changing a lot... At the same time, now Google is being challenged by a bunch of other alternative ways to serve these search queries..."

- The way content is created to answer search queries is also evolving rapidly thanks to AI. Beyond templated programmatic SEO, AI enables creating higher quality, customized answers at scale to a wider range of search patterns.
"The other piece that is pretty important is the way that content is created to answer these questions that people have is also changing... now with AI, you can create much more like far more customized, flexible, and like in general, higher quality answers to a wider and wider range of search queries that are not so rigid in their structure."

- Despite short-term flux, search will remain a massively valuable acquisition channel long-term. But many open questions remain around zero-click results, market share between Google and alternatives, etc.  
"No matter how you look at it or what changes, it's pretty clear that search will remain like a massively valuable acquisition channel in the future. But there's a lot that's you know, a lot of like bumps and things that are changing in the short term, like, oh, well, you know, there's going to be more zero-click search results, what percentages will Google take, what percentage will go to other companies."

- For most companies today, Google is still the primary focus, so Daydream is focused on helping companies leverage their unique data/insights to produce high-quality content at scale to target long-tail searches. Optimizing for alternative search engines is a longer-term priority.
"On the daydream side, we've been less focused on optimizing for upstart search engines right now, mostly because we're focusing on the second trend that I mentioned, which is how do you actually absorb how you build a very good contextual understanding of what a company is doing and then produce really valuable content from that. And at the moment, Google still is the most valuable channel."

- Running a successful programmatic SEO program requires a cross-functional skillset spanning product thinking, marketing, SEO expertise and data - which is hard for most companies to assemble. Daydream helps bridge this gap.
"I think what I realized is a lot of heads of growth have a hard time assembling the right team to run the programmatic playbook, which is more complicated because it requires entry sources, product thinking, SEO expertise. There's a lot of distinct skills you have to combine to get it working."

3. TECHNOLOGY & PRODUCT DEVELOPMENTS
- Daydream can absorb any internal company data sources and external public web data (even if not in training data) to provide rich context for generating high-quality, unique SEO content. This solves a core challenge with purely AI-generated content lacking key context.
"Daydream currently is able to absorb any data source inside a company and any data source externally on the public web, even if the model's not trained on it. So between those two things, it actually solves one of the most foundational problems of creating great content using AI, which is context."

4. COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
[Discussion did not cover Daydream's specific competitive positioning]

5. TEAM & CULTURE SIGNALS  
- Senuka believes in taking a "calm" approach to running a startup - not getting overwhelmed by day-to-day ups and downs, but focusing on steadily solving problems. Learned principles of equanimity and non-attachment living in a Zen Buddhist temple.
"Buddhism a lot of it's about this idea that when you form attachment to things that creates like us like a it creates like suffering and so it's super easy if you're building a company to fuse your identity into it and then now you have an attachment and then once you have the attachment as the company goes up and down you go up and down and so what I found out with the Buddhist stuff is it's really about like letting that go."

- Wants to build a world-class, fast-growing venture-backed company without the typical startup founder lifestyle of being "super neurotic and like sleeping under my desk". Believes motivation from curiosity and meaning is more sustainable than fear and insecurity.   
"Can I build something that has like a world-class outcome but in a way that feels more aligned to my way of living because I don't think I can be like call it the more traditional archetype which is like super neurotic and like sleeping under my desk and all that stuff."

6. KEY METRICS & BUSINESS DETAILS
- Daydream has raised two venture rounds, one unannounced at the time of the interview.
"We various two rounds we have announced one but it'll probably be announced by the time this podcast comes out."

7. NOTABLE TECHNOLOGIES
- GPT-3.5 marked an inflection point in the ability to automate large parts of the programmatic SEO process in a way that was much harder previously. This was one of the catalysts for starting Daydream.
"Particularly around when GPD 3.5 came out, it really became clear to me that the technology was kind of in a place where you could now automate huge pieces of what was required to build programmatic SEO in a way that was much easier than in the previous generation."
