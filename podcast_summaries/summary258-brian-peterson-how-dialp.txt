   Peterson argues that voice communication is one of the last major untapped sources of business data.
   Quote: "Our other slogan is like, voice is the last offline data set. It was really, if you think about business, it's the only thing that isn't tracked."

2. AI Enhancing Rather than Replacing Humans:

3. The Importance of Owning the Entire Customer Journey:
   Dialpad's strategy focuses on providing a comprehensive platform that covers all aspects of customer communication.
   Quote: "That's kind of our other strategy is we want to own the whole customer journey because you've all probably had bad experiences too where like you start on like an online chat that is clearly a bot and it doesn't help you and you escalate and then you kind of have to repeat yourself right to the person you're now talking to or provide the same information again a lot of times it's because a completely different system."
