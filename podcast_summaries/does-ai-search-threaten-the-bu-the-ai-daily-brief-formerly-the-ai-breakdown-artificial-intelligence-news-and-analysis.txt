   - Traditional search engines are being challenged by AI-powered alternatives.
   - Quote: "Q mentioned that the search segment is more wide open than it's ever been, stating, 'Prior to AI, my feeling around this was none of the others were valid choices. I think today there is a much greater potential because there are new entrants attacking the problem in a different way.'"

   - AI is being developed to automate and optimize ad creation and targeting.
   - Quote: "Zuckerberg isn't trying to cut humans out of the Super Bowl ad process. He's not arguing that they can build a brand better than an agency can. Zuckerberg is focused on making the treadmill of social media advertising, in other words, direct response advertising, not brand advertising, direct response advertising, as cheap and efficient as possible."

4. **AI in Geopolitics and International Relations**
   - AI technology and chip exports are becoming key factors in international diplomacy.

## 2. Areas of Discussion/Debate

1. **AI Search vs. Traditional Search**

3. **Export Controls on AI Chips**
   - Debate over the effectiveness and impact of export controls on AI chips.
