3. Shifting Bottlenecks in Product Development:
   With AI handling much of the coding, new bottlenecks emerge in decision-making, alignment, and code review processes.
   Quote: "We really rapidly became bottlenecked on other things, our merge queue. We had to completely re-architect it because so much more code was being written and so many more pull requests were being submitted that it just completely blew out the expectations of it."

4. The Importance of Context in AI:
   Mike emphasizes the critical role of context and memory in making AI truly useful, highlighting the potential of Anthropic's Multi-modal Conversational Protocol (MCP).
   Quote: "My fake equation for utility of AI products, it's three part. One is model intelligence, the second part is context and memory, and the third part is applications and UI."

5. Rethinking Product Metrics for AI:
   Traditional engagement metrics may not be suitable for AI products, necessitating new ways to measure value and impact.
   Quote: "How do you think about product metrics when a good conversation with me could be two messages or 200? Traditional engagement metrics might be misleading when depth matters more than frequency."

6. AI's Impact on Future Skills:
   The conversation touches on the skills that will be valuable in an AI-driven future, emphasizing curiosity, independent thinking, and the ability to leverage AI tools effectively.
   Quote: "So I think nurturing curiosity and still having a sense of, I don't know, the scientific process sounds grandiose to instill in a six-year-old, but that process of discovery and asking questions and then, systematically working right through, I think will still be important."

7. The Challenge of Differentiation in the AI Space:
   Mike discusses the importance of finding unique value propositions and target markets in the competitive AI landscape.
   Quote: "How do we figure out what we want to be when we grow up versus what we currently aren't or wish that we were or see other players in the space being?"
