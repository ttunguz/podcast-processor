   Flock's approach to hardware development mimics software iteration cycles.
   Quote: "We treated hardware development like software until like we couldn't. And on some of our products, we don't anymore. But for most of our products, because of the business model we developed, you know, I think Peloton did a pretty good job of this too. Our customers have no idea what version of the camera they're on."

3. Customer Obsession:
   Langley stresses the importance of constant customer interaction for product development.

   Quote: "We just looked at our own balance sheet and said, like, we can't finance. Even today, even with a really, we have a lot of cash on hand, we raised a bunch of money. It still is prudent to force the customer to say, hey, like, you got to pay up front."

3. Investor Relations Strategy:
   Langley recommends regular, non-fundraising interactions with potential investors.
   Quote: "Early on, one day a quarter, I committed to like IR, you know, like spending time with investors. And I never shared numbers because as soon as you share numbers, you're fundraising."

4. Vision for Societal Impact:
