6. The Importance of "Mattering" in Tech:

**3. Actionable Investment Theses (Early-Stage VC Focus):**

1. AI-First User Interfaces:
   Problem: Traditional software interfaces may become obsolete for new users.
   Solution: Invest in companies developing AI-driven, natural language interfaces.
   Quote: "They will use voice agents, agent-driven interfaces, and national language interactions."
   Why compelling: This represents a fundamental shift in how users interact with technology.
   Relevant companies: OpenAI (rumored device)

2. AI Infrastructure:
   Problem: Massive demand for AI computing power and data management.
   Solution: Invest in companies providing AI infrastructure and tools.
   Quote: "The infrastructure spend is unprecedented in the history of internet."
   Why compelling: The scale of investment indicates a long-term trend.
   Relevant companies: Snowflake, Databricks

3. AI-Driven Business Process Automation:
   Problem: Traditional B2B SaaS models are threatened by AI advancements.

**4. Noteworthy Observations & Unique Perspectives:**

1. The podcast suggests that the rapid adoption of AI technologies may outpace human ability to process the rate of change.
   Quote: "I don't think as humans, we can process the rate of change of AI. It's so fast that we don't understand almost how quickly it's changing."

2. The discussion highlights a potential shift in how new users will interact with technology, suggesting that traditional software interfaces may become obsolete.
   Quote: "You really think that the next generation is going to even understand what a Salesforce UI is? It won't even make sense to them."

3. The conversation suggests that the massive investments in AI infrastructure by tech giants might lead to a period of high costs before significant revenues are realized.
   Quote: "If someone said to you, you can finance a $600 billion CapEx business, four or five years in, you'd have $10, $15 million billion in revenue and $585 billion in losses, you'd probably say, ah, no, I don't need that right now. But that's where we're at."

4. The podcast discusses the idea that many companies and products may not "matter" in the long run, challenging the notion of what constitutes an important or successful venture.
   Quote: "I think the default is that most of us don't matter, and most of the companies in the world don't matter. But the things that matter really matter, right?"

5. The discussion suggests that the increasing valuations of early-stage startups, particularly from Y Combinator, are forcing venture capitalists to adapt their strategies and potentially accept lower ownership stakes.
   Quote: "I've ended up owning about a little less than half of what I would have."
