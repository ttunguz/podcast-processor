# 2. Key Themes, Technological Insights & Core Discussion Points

1. AI Integration in Data Platforms
   - Starburst is focusing on making their platform AI-ready and helping users leverage AI.
   - Quote: "We like we started this with two goals in mind. One was to make Starburst better for our users by using AI, and the other one was to help our users build their own AI applications."

2. Importance of Metadata for AI Applications
   - High-quality metadata is crucial for effective AI use in data platforms.
   - Quote: "We say here at Starbucks that your AI is going to be only as good as your data is, but maybe it's even more true that your AI is going to be only as good as your metadata is at the end of the day."

3. Challenges in Data Privacy and Compliance
   - Sending data to LLMs raises concerns about privacy and regulatory compliance.
   - Quote: "Many of our customers have pretty strict rules about what data can be sent to an LLM. And they're even stricter than essentially the rules on what specific users can access."

4. SQL-Based AI Workflows
   - Starburst enables users to implement RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) workflows entirely in SQL.
   - Quote: "We're proposing is go the other direction, right? So you can, using Starburst, you have access to both. You can federate the data, you can join it, and then you can gather the data and pass it through a SQL function to the LLM and have it summarize it or whatnot."

5. Governance and Access Control for AI Models
   - Starburst provides granular control over AI model access and usage.
   - Quote: "We do offer governance at several levels. One is you can obviously control who can access specific functions, but then we take it a step further."

6. Challenges in Testing AI-Integrated Systems
   - The probabilistic nature of LLMs makes traditional testing approaches difficult.
   - Quote: "Being able to write tests is very challenging when you're back and when the system that you're testing is probabilistic and it's not deterministic, right?"

7. Future of BI Tools with AI Integration
   - AI is seen as the future direction for Business Intelligence tools.
   - Quote: "I personally think this is sort of the way in which BI tools are headed, right? So, like allowing users to provide ad hoc explorations just using natural language and visualizing the results of their questions."

# 3. Actionable Investment Theses (Early-Stage VC Focus)

1. AI-Powered Data Exploration and Visualization Tools
   - Problem: Traditional BI tools lack intuitive, natural language interfaces for data exploration.
   - Solution: AI-driven tools that allow users to explore and visualize data using conversational interfaces.
   - Quote: "Allowing users to provide ad hoc explorations just using natural language and visualizing the results of their questions."
   - Opportunity: Invest in startups developing AI-powered BI tools that make data exploration more accessible to non-technical users.

2. Advanced Metadata Management for AI Applications
   - Problem: Lack of high-quality metadata limits the effectiveness of AI in data platforms.
   - Solution: AI-driven tools for generating, enriching, and managing metadata.
   - Quote: "Your AI is going to be only as good as your metadata is at the end of the day."
   - Opportunity: Invest in startups focusing on AI-powered metadata management solutions that enhance data discoverability and AI model performance.

3. Privacy-Preserving AI for Data Platforms
   - Problem: Sending sensitive data to LLMs raises privacy and compliance concerns.
   - Solution: Develop privacy-preserving techniques for using AI in data platforms.
   - Quote: "Many of our customers have pretty strict rules about what data can be sent to an LLM."
   - Opportunity: Invest in startups working on privacy-enhancing technologies for AI, such as federated learning or homomorphic encryption applied to data platforms.

# 4. Noteworthy Observations & Unique Perspectives

1. SQL as an Interface for AI Workflows
   - Starburst's approach of integrating AI capabilities directly into SQL functions makes AI more accessible to data analysts.
   - Quote: "I think it's the easiest way to basically get started with an LLM. You don't need to know anything about APIs, don't need to know Python, nothing."

2. AI for Data Join Inference
   - AI can be used to infer join conditions between datasets with dissimilar column names.
   - Quote: "With AI, you can actually do some semantic analysis and find the matching columns that way and be able to join data, you know, figure out the join essentially, or have the machine figure out the join in ways that were not possible before."

3. Synthetic Data Generation Using LLMs
   - LLMs can be used to generate synthetic datasets for testing, avoiding the use of sensitive PII data.
   - Quote: "Using LLMs to generate synthetic data sets is another interesting use case that we've seen."

4. Challenges of Integrating LLMs with SQL Paradigms
   - The asynchronous nature of LLM batch APIs doesn't align well with traditional SQL query execution.
   - Quote: "These batch APIs are typically async, so they're not going to work well with a select statement. We are considering a slightly different paradigm there."

5. The Need for Intelligent Data Observability
   - Current tools lack semantic understanding of data relationships, which AI could potentially address.
   - Quote: "I think current tools still struggle at, well, while they're good at, say, syntax validation, basic data profiling, they still struggle at understanding, you know, semantic understanding of relationships between data."
