## Invest Like the Best with Patrick O'Shaughnessy - Podcast - Episode: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/cliff-sosin-investing-in-carvana/id1154105909?i=1000705376562
Host(s): Patrick O'Shaughnessy
Guest(s): Cliff Sosin
Here is a structured summary of the podcast transcript based on the requested points:

1. **Major Themes & Technology Trends:**

- Online used car retailing: Carvana's business model of selling used cars entirely online represents a major shift in the auto retail industry.
   Quote: "Carvana is an online retailer of used cars. It was founded in 2013 by Ernie Garcia, who you've had on. And if you were to broadly describe the company's history from 2013 to 2021, it was up and to the right."

- Economies of scale and scope in e-commerce: The discussion highlights how Carvana's business model benefits from multiple layers of scale advantages across inventory, logistics, reconditioning, and financing.
   Quote: "You can think about a company's profitability over time is kind of its market opportunity times its advantage."

- AI in investing: The conversation touches on the growing role of AI in investment research and decision-making.
   Quote: "I use various AIs every day. In particular for businesses where there's a lot of information on the internet, right?"

2. **Areas of Discussion/Debate:**

- Management quality vs. business quality: The guest discusses his evolving view on the importance of management teams in investment decisions.
   Quote: "If I rank things instead of how they ultimately turned out over the full span, the management teams were wildly predictive of my outcomes versus my expectations."

- Concentration vs. diversification in investing: The conversation explores the trade-offs between concentrated and diversified investment approaches.
   Quote: "On the margin, I think there's probably room to be a little more diversified. But, you know, like we've had a lot of success over the whole history of the fund, up to through and including this period, that success was because of how we did things."

3. **Potential Investment Ideas:**

- Contained businesses: The guest expresses a preference for businesses with advantages that are less susceptible to rapid change or disruption.
   Quote: "I have like a less of an interest I should say in investing in businesses that have narrower advantages. Because like life will throw massive curveballs at you."

- US-focused investments: The guest indicates a preference for investing in US companies due to familiarity and market size.
   Quote: "I just think that like the US is an enormous market, there's lots of interesting things to do."

4. **Surprising/Counterintuitive Observations:**

- Credit union pricing behavior: The guest describes how credit unions' slow reaction to rising interest rates created unexpected challenges for Carvana's financing business.
   Quote: "Navy Federal was offering car loans at a discount to the treasury of the comparable duration. And this is a big problem for us."

- Early adopter impact on demand: The discussion reveals how the surge in early adopter demand during the pandemic created unexpected challenges for Carvana later.
   Quote: "You pulled your demand forward. So from Carvana's perspective, even if this is like Carvana's 2021 had like 1% share. So even if this 0.3% of the market, this does not have to be a lot of the market for Carvana to feel this enormous demand poll, which they definitely saw."

Here's a structured summary of the podcast transcript based on the requested points:

## 1. Major Themes & Technology Trends

1. **AI Funding and Valuations**: Large funding rounds for AI companies, particularly in China and the US.
   > "XAI Holdings is reportedly raising the second largest private funding round in history. The company which encompasses Elon Musk's AI and social media business is in talks to raise $20 billion at a $120 billion valuation"

2. **AI Integration in Personal Computing**: Microsoft's launch of the "recall" feature for AI-enabled PCs.
   > "Microsoft has launched their controversial recall feature... It promised to keep track of everything users do on their computer and use AI to turn it into a searchable memory function."

3. **AI Model Behavior and Alignment**: Concerns about AI models being too agreeable or "sycophantic".
   > "Sam Altman certainly seems to think so. Over the weekend he posted, the last couple of GPT4O updates have made the personality too sickle fancy and annoying"

4. **Interpretability in AI**: The urgent need to understand the inner workings of AI systems.
   > "Dariomide recently posted that on his blog, a piece called 'The Urgency of Interpretability.' He writes, 'Over the last few months, I've become increasingly focused on the tantalizing possibility, opened up by some recent advances, that we could succeed at interpretability.'"

## 2. Areas of Discussion/Debate

1. **AI Model Agreeableness**: Debate over whether AI models should be more or less agreeable to users.
   > "When you're trying to do business with it, for example, using chat GPT as a brainstorming partner around a business strategy, things can get pretty pear shaped pretty fast if the model is trained to just agree with anything you say."

2. **AI Safety and Alignment**: Discussion on the risks of misaligned AI and the need for interpretability.
   > "Many of the risks and worries associated with generative AI are ultimately consequences of this opacity, and would be much easier to address if the models were interpretable."

3. **AI in High-Stakes Applications**: Debate on the readiness of AI for critical applications.
   > "AI systems opacity also means that they are simply not used in many applications, such as high stakes financial or safety critical settings, because we can't fully set the limits of their behavior"

## 3. Potential Investment Ideas

1. **AI Interpretability Tools**: Companies developing tools to understand and explain AI decision-making processes.
2. **AI Safety and Alignment Solutions**: Startups focusing on ensuring AI systems behave as intended and align with human values.
3. **Enterprise-Grade AI Agents**: Companies developing AI agents specifically tailored for business use cases with high reliability requirements.

## 4. Surprising/Counterintuitive Observations

1. The rapid shift in public perception of AI features from "creepy" to potentially commonplace.
   > "When this was announced, I said that it was the type of feature that would seem insane to people right now, and in the future would be incredibly commonplace and not controversial at all."

2. The possibility that average users might prefer more agreeable and effusive AI outputs, contrary to expert opinions.
   > "To be honest, one of the big insights out of the recent LM Arena scandal was that, yes, perhaps the average user does simply enjoy these kind of outputs."

Here is a structured summary of the podcast transcript based on the requested points:

1. **Major Themes & Technology Trends:**

- AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) revolutionizing industries
   Quote: "We have companies basically, you know, going from zero to $6 million in revenue in six months. We have companies going from $0 to $12 million a year in revenue in 12 months, right? And with under a dozen people, like, usually five or six people."

- The importance of founder-led companies and "founder mode"
   Quote: "You know, I, this is actually my company. I am actually going to have a hand and a role to play in all the different parts of this company."

- The potential and challenges of AI regulation
   Quote: "I think we're going into a very interesting moment right now with, you know, the AI czar is Sri Ram Krishnan, who, you know, used to be a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz."

2. **Areas of Discussion/Debate:**

- The role of human agency in AI development and implementation
   Quote: "And so, you know, the difference between what Jake did with GPT-4 when it first came out and what O1 and O1 Pro maybe is doing and what Deepseek R1 is doing clearly because it's open source. You can see it is that those steps, like breaking it down into steps and the sort of metacognition of like whether or not like it makes sense at all of those micro steps."

- The balance between AI advancement and potential job displacement
   Quote: "And then the scary version of this is like, yes, some of it actually is labor displacement, right?"

3. **Potential Investment Ideas:**

- AI-powered call centers
   Quote: "I funded a company in this very current batch that is called Leaping AI. They are working with some of the biggest wine merchants in Germany, which is fascinating."

- Companies focusing on AI applications in specific industries (e.g., legal tech, biotech)
   Quote: "So there's a cancer vaccine biotech company called Helix that did YC a great many years ago. But what they've figured out is they can actually hook up some of these models to actual wet lab tests."

4. **Surprising/Counterintuitive Observations:**

- The importance of breaking down complex AI tasks into smaller steps
   Quote: "If GPT-4 started hallucinating for them, they realized that they were doing too much work in one prompt. They needed to take that thing that they asked GPT-4 to do and then break it up into smaller steps."

- The potential for AI to increase human agency rather than decrease it
   Quote: "Like, all of the impediments to being able to, you know, all the impediments to fully realizing what you want to do in the world are starting to fall away."

Here's a structured summary based on the podcast transcript:

1. **Major Themes & Technology Trends:**

   a) AI-powered document processing:
   "Reducto is transforming the way how businesses handle document processing by reading complex docs like PDFs the way humans do and creating remarkably accurate LLM ready inputs."

   b) Rapid iteration in AI development:
   "The pace of iteration on AI teams in particular is a lot faster than I think people give it credit for."

   c) Importance of accuracy in document processing:
   "Given our team size, that's not the type of customer that we've decided to chase. We're very upfront about whether or not we are or are not the right solution for them."

2. **Areas of Discussion/Debate:**

   a) Vertical vs. horizontal product approach:
   "We did briefly on a go-to-market perspective. Obviously it would be easier to sort of be a healthcare specific document processing company and to be able to point to the in that entire industry for that."

   b) Hiring strategy for startups:
   "Hiring was the first thing that came to mind for where we went slow. I think we were at four employees when we crossed a million in ARR for the first time."

3. **Potential Investment Ideas:**

   a) AI-powered document processing for specific industries (e.g., healthcare, finance)
   b) Tools for improving AI model accuracy and efficiency
   c) Infrastructure for integrating human-generated data with AI systems

4. **Surprising/Counterintuitive Observations:**

   a) The importance of relationship-building in enterprise sales:
   "I don't think that that is true, at least in my experience for enterprise sales. Like it matters a lot what our accuracy numbers are in their benchmarks. But it's so clearly relationship driven in a way that I at least did not know as somebody that doesn't come from an enterprise sales background."

   b) The value of a small, focused team:
   "I generally think when you have a small set of people working on a really important problem, each person there is really forced to go deep into the nuances of what matters."
