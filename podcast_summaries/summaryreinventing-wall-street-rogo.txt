4. Future of Finance and AI:
   Gabe shares his vision for Rogo becoming the "most effective analyst on Wall Street" within 5-10 years. He also discusses the potential for AI to democratize high-level financial services, making them accessible to smaller businesses and startups.

**2. Key Themes, Technological Insights & Core Discussion Points:**

1. AI's Role in Financial Analysis:
   Rogo combines LLM capabilities with access to specialized financial tools and data sources.
   Quote: "We work with providers SP Global CapIQ to make sure that we have,, if they, if we have mutual customers, they can query the CapIQ data through Rogo."

2. Importance of Domain-Specific AI Training:
   Rogo fine-tunes AI models specifically for financial workflows and tools.
   Quote: "We teach the model how to do that by using a technique called post-training or reinforcement fine-tuning to learn how to use the tools that finance professionals use."

3. Balancing AI Innovation with Enterprise Security:
   Implementing AI in finance requires stringent security measures and enterprise-grade features.
   Quote: "We were forced to think about what it meant to be multi-cloud, what it meant to deploy on-prem, what it meant to have these enterprise-grade permissioning systems and R-backed systems and governance systems."

4. AI Augmentation vs. Replacement:
   The focus is on enhancing human capabilities rather than replacing jobs entirely.
   Quote: "It's going to replace workflows. I don't think it's going to replace people."

5. Challenges of Enterprise AI Sales:
   Selling AI solutions to large financial institutions requires navigating complex stakeholder landscapes.
   Quote: "Enterprise sales is difficult... It's political. You have to figure out what people want to hear. What are the pain points? How to thread the needle."

6. Democratization of Financial Services:
   AI has the potential to make high-level financial services accessible to smaller businesses.
   Quote: "If you have a $20 million EV HVAC business, who's running your sell-side process? No one. So you're getting a 20% worse price when you sell it to some private equity-backed roll-up."

7. Future of AI in Finance:
   AI is expected to become an essential tool for financial firms to remain competitive.
   Quote: "I think it will be very hard to run an investment firm or a bank if you don't employ Rogo, right? If you don't literally have an army of Rogo analysts helping you be smarter and more effective."

**3. Actionable Investment Theses (Early-Stage VC Focus):**

1. AI-Powered Financial Analysis Platforms:
   Problem: Traditional financial analysis is time-consuming and often inaccessible to smaller firms.
   Solution: AI platforms that automate and enhance financial analysis, making it faster and more accessible.
   Quote: "In Rogo, you can say, hey, take these 10 companies, make 10 PowerPoint slide pages, and you can get an output in 30 seconds."
   Why compelling: Increasing demand for faster, more accurate financial analysis across various firm sizes.
   Relevant companies: Rogo

2. Democratized High-Level Financial Services:
   Problem: Smaller businesses lack access to sophisticated financial services and advice.
   Solution: AI-powered platforms that provide high-quality financial services at a fraction of the cost.
   Quote: "If we have the technology to help folks do that, I'd love to directly offer it and help make private markets more efficient and help democratize some of these high-finance financial services that not everyone has access to today."
   Why compelling: Expands the market for financial services and levels the playing field for smaller businesses.
   Relevant companies: Not explicitly mentioned, but Rogo is moving in this direction.

3. AI-Enhanced Professional Services:
   Problem: Traditional professional services (consulting, legal, etc.) are expensive and often inaccessible to smaller clients.
   Solution: AI tools that augment professional services, making them more efficient and cost-effective.
   Quote: "We already have a few consulting firms on the platform. We have one of the big three who is rolling out the product, not just for their front office consultants, but for the,, the research teams they have internally."
   Why compelling: Potential to transform multiple professional services industries beyond finance.
   Relevant companies: Not explicitly mentioned, but Rogo's expansion into consulting suggests this trend.

**4. Noteworthy Observations & Unique Perspectives:**

1. AI's impact on job roles:
   Quote: "You might not spend as much time data cubing and preparing presentations and, in the thick of an Excel, and you might spend more time thinking about a company or a problem. You might spend more time meeting with stakeholders and founders and executives, forming those relationships."

2. The value of domain-specific AI:
   Quote: "Even if you had this ingenious LLM, if it doesn't have access to a tool Excel, can it really build a full three-statement model? It can in Python, but that's not auditable and it's not really built for that."

3. The challenge of selling AI to financial institutions:
   Quote: "But all the banks and hedge funds and private equity firms we spoke to, I think they thought. this guy gave us full of snake oil, not this is going to change the way we work."

4. The potential for AI to change financial services pricing:
   Quote: "What if you don't need to hire a banker to produce a fairness opinion, right? What if you don't need to pay $25 million to do that?"

5. The importance of human touch in certain financial services:
   Quote: "If you're brokering a transaction and it takes a human in the loop and you want to shake someone's hand and you want to trust who you're partnering with and negotiating with, that's when a banker is going to be invaluable."
