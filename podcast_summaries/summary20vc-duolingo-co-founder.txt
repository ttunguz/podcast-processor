He also shares insights on valuation considerations and the transition to becoming a public company.

3. European vs. US Startup Ecosystem:

5. AI's Impact on Education and Business:

The podcast concludes with Severin's reflections on personal growth, the impact of success on relationships, and advice on partner selection for both business and personal life. He emphasizes the importance of having a clear mission and purpose beyond financial success when building a company.

**2. Key Themes & Technological Insights:**

1. AI as a Game-Changer in EdTech:
   AI is revolutionizing content creation and personalization in education. Severin states, "We can really build an AI tutor that is as good as the best human AI tutors. And we can do it for everyone, not just the rich."

2. Data-Driven Product Development:
   Duolingo's success is attributed to running thousands of A/B tests. Severin explains, "We run a lot of experiments. This is also true for marketing. It's not A-B experiments, but it's more like, let's try this on TikTok, let's try this on Instagram, and then double down on the stuff that works."

3. The Future of Work with AI:
   AI is expected to significantly boost productivity. Severin notes, "We all need to become more productive. We don't have enough kids. And then, you know, like, how are we going to finance our? We need every single productivity gain we can get."

4. The Importance of Brand in Consumer Tech:
   Duolingo's strong brand has been a key factor in its success. Severin mentions, "I think at some point we were bigger on TikTok than Nike, a brand that has existed for a very long time."

5. The Evolution of Education:
   AI is changing the landscape of education, but human elements remain crucial. Severin states, "I think that there's still going to be this human element of what do I need to learn? Kind of guidance and coaching and motivation."

**3. Core Discussion Points & Debates:**

1. AI's Role in Content Creation:
   Severin discusses how AI has dramatically accelerated Duolingo's course creation process. He states, "It took us 12 years to build the first 100 courses or so. And now, within one year, we built another 148 courses."

2. The Value of Human Interaction in an AI-Driven World:
   Despite AI advancements, Severin believes human interaction will become more valuable. He argues, "I think the human-to-human interaction, the value of that will go up significantly."

3. The Future of Software Engineering with AI:
   There's debate about how AI will impact software engineering roles. Severin notes, "If you had asked me a year ago, I would have said 100% more [software engineers]. Now I'm a little bit less certain."

4. The Importance of Mission-Driven Companies:
   Severin emphasizes the value of starting with a purpose beyond financial gain. He states, "I think that the counterintuitively, the founders that start with a purpose and a mission and are not focused too much on money end up usually doing better."

**5. Noteworthy Observations & Unique Perspectives:**

1. On the value of details in product development:
   Severin states, "I think ultimately product quality is details. Luis, he's obsessed with details. He can spot something being not properly aligned within half a second. The details really, really matter."

2. On the importance of retention in consumer apps:
   "The only thing that matters is retention. You can spend as much money as you want. If you don't have retention, it's a leaky bucket. All these people are going to leave."

3. On the challenges of maintaining personal identity as a successful founder:
   "I feel like I'm reduced to just Duolingo. My identity is Duolingo. I'm the founder of Duolingo. Every international. And I feel there's much more to me, to my personal identity, than just Duolingo."

4. On the potential negative effects of having a Silicon Valley office:
   "You basically create a hiring of Publiore for Silicon Valley and you lose your talent. That was also new to me. And then I was like, no, no, no, no, let's not do that."

5. On the importance of prior working relationships in founding teams:
   "What is the best predictor of two founders working out? Like, you know, they're actually, they're not going to get into a fight and founder conflict. And the number one thing to look for is: have the two founders worked before they started this company?"
