   Quote: "While we've done a huge amount of work inside IBM leveraging AI and automation on certain enterprise workflows, our total employment has actually gone up. Because what it does is it gives you more investment to put into other areas." - Arvind Krishna, IBM CEO

2. **Shift from isolated AI experiments to coordinated deployment**
   Quote: "We're trying to bridge the gap from where we are today, which is thousands of experiments, into enterprise-grade deployments, which require the same kind of security, governance, and standards that we demand on mission-critical applications." - Vertica Gunnar, General Manager for Data and AI at IBM

### 3. Potential Investment Ideas

1. **Enterprise-grade AI deployment platforms**: Tools for scaling AI from experiments to full-scale operations in large organizations.

2. **AI-powered HR and procurement solutions**: Given IBM's success in these areas, there's potential for startups to develop specialized AI tools for these functions.

3. **AI upskilling and reskilling platforms**: With the increasing demand for AI skills, platforms that help workers adapt to the AI-driven workplace could be valuable.
