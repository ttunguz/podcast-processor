**Conclusion:** 
The conversation concludes with Wes emphasizing the importance of having a unique perspective and using personal frustrations or observations as inspiration for creating valuable content and solutions.

**2. Key Themes & Technological Insights:**

1. Effective Online Education:
   Wes discusses the development of Alt MBA as a response to low completion rates in MOOCs. She emphasizes the importance of engagement and live interaction in online learning.
   Quote: "I started digging into the completion rates of video courses and realized that they were abysmally low. I think 3 to 6% is completion rate."

2. Content Creation and Audience Building:
   The podcast highlights the importance of consistently providing value and having a unique perspective in content creation.
   Quote: "Having a spiky point of view is really valuable. And so when I say spiky point of view, I don't mean stirring the pot with controversial statements just for the sake of it. I mean having a unique stance based on your lived experience that you are able to back up with evidence, stories, logic, et cetera."

3. Communication in Digital Workplaces:
   Wes discusses the importance of clear, concise communication in digital environments like Slack and email.
   Quote: "The biggest bottleneck to clear communication, to being concise, is lack of preparation."

**3. Core Discussion Points & Debates:**

1. Authenticity in Leadership:
   The podcast debates the concept of authenticity in leadership and communication.
   Quote: "I think that we are sometimes different versions of ourselves in different settings, in different contexts, with different people. And so this idea of, you know, you are being authentic or you're not, or there's like one true way to be authentic or one true way that you are, I don't know if I believe that."

2. Strategic Thinking vs. Tactical Execution:
   The conversation explores what it means to be "more strategic" in business contexts.
   Quote: "I think on the manager side, getting more specific about what does that actually look like for you in your role in this context, what does not strategic look like or less strategic? And then what would more strategic look like?"

3. Personal Growth vs. Organizational Expectations:
   The podcast discusses the balance between personal development and meeting organizational needs.
   Quote: "If you find yourself having that ratio flipped where 20% of the time you're using your strengths, 80% of the time you're, you know, kind of feeling like you're flailing, kind of feeling like you're doing stuff that you're not very good at, not very naturally suited for, I mean, that's where a role change could make sense."

**4. Actionable Investment Theses (Early-Stage VC Focus):**

1. Innovative Online Education Platforms:
   Problem: Low engagement and completion rates in traditional online courses.
   Solution: Platforms that offer more interactive, cohort-based learning experiences.
   Why compelling now: Increased demand for effective online education post-pandemic.
   Relevant companies: Maven (mentioned in the podcast)

2. Tools for Effective Digital Communication:
   Problem: Inefficient communication in digital workplaces leading to misunderstandings and wasted time.
   Solution: AI-powered tools that help structure and clarify digital communications.
   Why compelling now: Continued growth of remote and hybrid work environments.
   Mentioned companies: None specifically, but Slack is referenced as a communication platform.

**5. Noteworthy Observations & Unique Perspectives:**

1. The "Meest Me" Approach to Leadership:
   Wes advocates for leaders to embrace their unique qualities rather than conforming to traditional leadership stereotypes.
   Quote: "One of my life mottos, especially in recent years, is a little bit silly, but I'm going to share it with you. It's be the meest me."

2. The Value of Frustration in Innovation:
   Wes suggests that personal frustrations can be a powerful source of inspiration for creating valuable content or solutions.
   Quote: "Everything, almost everything I write about, the root is something that annoys me. And then I turn it into something much more positive because the frustration part isn't always, you know, isn't always the best angle."

3. Rethinking Communication Training:
   Wes critiques traditional communication training that focuses heavily on public speaking, arguing for more emphasis on day-to-day business communication skills.
   Quote: "I feel like there's so much communication content, books, courses that basically roughly equate communication with public speaking and delivery... And it's just not that helpful for learning and improving your ability to do well in a high-stakes meeting that's moving quickly with stakeholders with different points of view."
