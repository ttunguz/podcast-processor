Host(s): Patrick O'Shaughnessy
Guest(s): Rick Ruback, Royce Yudkoff
Here is a structured summary of the podcast transcript based on the requested points:

1. **Major Themes & Technology Trends:**

- Entrepreneurship through acquisition (ETA): Buying and running small businesses as a career path
   Quote: "We really do believe that if you go out and you run a small business better, you're making the world a better place."

- Bifurcation in the search fund ecosystem:
   Quote: "The small firm acquisition space is really bifurcated with the funded searchers really moving up market into much larger deals... And the unfunded or self funded... deals have actually gotten a little smaller."

- SBA loan program enabling acquisitions:
   Quote: "In the United States, we have this amazing opportunity that's created by the SBA loan program, where every American citizen has the right to borrow up to $5 million in this government backed loan program."

2. **Areas of Discussion/Debate:**

- Optimal holding period for acquired businesses:
   Quote: "Will Thorndyke... has actually looked at a lot of the data and concluded that everyone sells too early, that the successful companies really compound their success in year seven, eight, 10, 12, and then really there should be much longer holds."

- Role of technology in small business acquisitions:
   Quote: "Many of our students want to go on a business, particularly if it's being sold by somebody who's in their 60s or 70s, it's probably technologically light. And our students always have this great desire to spend a couple hundred thousand dollars on a CRM."

3. **Potential Investment Ideas:**

- Niche software businesses:
   Quote: "They tend to buy niche software businesses. They're software for podiatrists. They're software for small municipalities."

- Service-based businesses with recurring revenue:
   Quote: "We direct our students to businesses that are capital light... we are nudging them to business service companies where EBITDA almost exactly equals free cash flow."

4. **Surprising/Counterintuitive Observations:**

- Multiples for very small businesses remain low despite increased interest:
   Quote: "If you want to buy a firm with $750,000 of EBITDA, that's a pretty good recurring revenue business without a lot of customer concentration, you can still do that for 4x."

- First-year performance often underperforms expectations:
   Quote: "They all project 5 or 10 percent growth in their conservative case their first year. And they all have 5 or 10 percent losses their first year."
