# 7. TomTunguz.com Style Blog Post Ideas

1. Title: "The Stablecoin Paradox: Why Circle's IPO Success Challenges Traditional Valuation Models"

   Quote: "Currently, 15X revenue of their 2024 revenue, 160 times net income. So if you compare that to Coinbase, Coinbase right now is 25 times earnings. Circle is trading at 160 times earnings."

2. Title: "The Crypto Treasury Playbook: Lessons from MicroStrategy's Bitcoin Accumulation Strategy"
   Core argument: Analyze the financial engineering behind MicroStrategy's Bitcoin accumulation strategy and explore whether this model is replicable for other companies or assets. The post would delve into the risks and potential rewards of this approach.
   Quote: "Sailor's a gangster. There will never be another him. And what Laura points out. It's not that there will never be. It will be a different game."

3. Title: "ICO 2.0: How New Platforms Are Reshaping Early-Stage Crypto Investments"
   Core argument: Examine the evolution of ICO platforms from the early days to current self-hosted models like Sonar. Discuss the implications for early-stage funding in the crypto space and potential regulatory challenges.
   Quote: "Now we have the adult version. And, I feel basically this is this long-term trajectory that we're seeing, where, back in the dot-com era, companies would, be startups and then they would go public early. Whereas nowadays, it takes forever."
