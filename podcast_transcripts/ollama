1
If you're building a consumer app, like the single most important thing is getting your initial user base.
2
And so it's a really hard, like cold start problem.
3
And we went through that ourselves: of like, hey, like, now I've released this app, and now I'm just going to start posting about it non-stop and like getting people to download it or use it.
4
But if it's within something like Farcaster, where it's, you know, you're never leaving the app, a user doesn't have to drop off and like download something, it's using the wallet that's already embedded to like participate in the app.
5
And then users can now share the mini app within the feed.
6
Like, we help with that virality for these users.
7
And so, this has been like a really huge selling point for a lot of developers.
8
Plus, like, Coinbase Wallet is being a Firecaster client as well.
9
So, they have like millions of users.
10
So, you're just getting in front of so many more users as a developer.
11
And so, to me, like, that's just been like a really like huge selling point to them.
12

Here's what SS Harvey Dude Muffin had to say on Apple Podcasts: I don't know much about crypto, but want to know literally everything about crypto people going rogue in crypto.
18
Laura, you're my new favorite podcast, especially because you talk like me and make me laugh as these wild details unfold.

Today's guest is Linda Shea, developer ecosystem lead at Farcaster.
29
Welcome, Linda.
30
Thanks.
31
Thanks for having me.
32
I've wanted to have you on the show for years, so I'm very excited to have this chat.
33
I know you're doing things with Farcaster now.
34
Previously, you were a crypto VC, but I want to start at the very beginning.
35
So take us all the way back.
36
How did you even get into crypto?
37
Oh, wow.
38
Okay.
39
I first came across crypto in 2011.
40
I was in college, and my friend came up to me and was like, hey, have you heard of the Silk Road?
41
And have you heard of Bitcoin?
42
And I was like, no, what is that?
43
And I was very intrigued by the concept, but thought it was pretty shady at the time because it was all associated with dark net markets.
44
And so I didn't end up getting us like buying it or anything, but I thought the technology was really interesting.
45
And I ended up writing an econ paper with the same person in it in college and kind of just like followed it along over time.
46
And then the pivotal moment for me was when Overstock announced they were accepting Bitcoin as payment.
47
And I looked at who did that and that was Coinbase.
48
And so that was like a very pivotal moment for me because I was like, this is the first time a legit company was willing to associate themselves with Bitcoin.
49
And this is the company enabling it.
50
So I got to join them.
51
And so just applied online, told them I would work in any role and then ended up joining them.
52
And that was my start to crypto.
53
That was 214.
54
And what were you doing there?
55
I told them I would work in any role.
56
So they said that what we need right now is someone to work on regulatory compliance investigations.
57
And so that was like working with regulators, law enforcement, and kind of on the compliance side.
58
I didn't really have a background in that, but I was like, I'm down to do.
59
And that was like a really interesting role doing like cyber crime investigations.
60
And so like in between that time you wrote the paper and then like you applied for the job at Coinbase, like were you just kind of watching Bitcoin or like why were you so certain that you wanted to work in Bitcoin once you found a legitimate company interested?
61
Yeah, so there was a few things that I think got me interested.
62
So one was my parents had been sending money out of China to the U.S.
63
for like decades.
64
Like it was just like, hey, there's caps on how much that can be sent out.
65
This is going to just take a really long time.
66
And that didn't really make sense to me as a concept of like you don't have control of your own money and it doesn't move across borders and governments have control over it.
67
So that was already something I just like grew up with.
68
And then during the cultural revolution, my parents were pretty young then and they would tell me stories how the government actually came and seized their assets because they were well educated and relatively wealthy.
69
Like they ran their own businesses.
70
And that also didn't make sense to me.
71
So I was like, that's crazy.
72
Like just some arbitrary education is bad by the government and all of a sudden you've lost your assets.
73
So I was already a little bit like crypto-killed in the sense that I was like, wow, you can control your own money and like Bitcoin enables this for the first time, but it's super shady and like I don't think it's going to take off.
74
So that was kind of just my thought and I was just keeping an eye on it over time.
75
And then not that this is super important.
76
Maybe it's too personal.
77
So we can cut it.
78
But like I'm confused about your, so your parents were here, but they were.
79
Like, they went even when they left China, they couldn't bring it, or oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
80
So, they have like Chinese bank accounts, just like any Chinese citizen.
81
And then, when they moved to America, like my dad moved for grad school, they just had money locked up in their bank accounts in China because there were withdrawal limits on how much they could actually move out.
82
And so, to this day, there's still money being moved out from their bank accounts.
83
Oh, my gosh.
84
Yeah.
85
And it's like this, like, really slow.
86
Wait, they must have been here for like decades by this point.
87
Yeah, yeah.
88
And there's like a cap on how much you can withdraw.
89
I don't know the exact cap, but like, we're not like insanely wealthy.
90
So, it's probably not too high of a cap.
91
But, okay.
92
I guess the other thing, and sorry if this gets just too personal, but I'm assuming by now they're American citizens.
93
So, I'm still confused.
94
Like, how?
95
Well, my mom is not, but my dad is.
96
And so, it's my mom's accounts that are still being pulled out.
97
Well, then, why doesn't she just become a U.S.
98
citizen?
99
And then she could probably just take the money, right?
100
No, it doesn't, it does not work that way, unfortunately.
101
In China, I don't know like all the logistics, but like, like they also inherited money from their parents.
102
And so, there's this huge process to like get the money from them to you.
103
And it's easier if you're a Chinese citizen and then you can get money to the U.S.
104
Like, it's a whole other deal, and it's like something that has been like the backdrop of me growing up for a really long time.
105
And so, I'm always hearing just like what of a painful process this is.
106
So, to me, just like digital currency and being able to move it across borders instantly without permission just like really resonates with me and with my parents too.
107
Like, when I told them about Bitcoin, they're like, oh my gosh, that makes a lot of sense.
108
This reminds me, I'm sure you have had this experience, like people from the US or Canada or whatever, they kind of like will shit on Bitcoin or something.
109
And then you're just like, okay, yeah, you are like showing your privilege here.
110
Yeah.
111
Yeah.
112
Exactly.
113
Because you're like, why would anyone use this?
114
Why would anyone need this?
115
And it's like, okay, go to a lot of other different countries and you'll see why, especially like, I mean, in Argentina, I spent a month there because I really wanted to get to know the crypto community more.
116
And like, it was so much more prevalent there as a use case in terms of actually using cryptocurrency.
117
So I think it just is so dependent on your upbringing and what you were exposed to.
118
Well, yeah.
119
So, but what's interesting is you started in regulatory compliance.
120
So like, did that change your view on crypto or what it could do?
121
Or like, what were your thoughts on that?
122
Because that must have been such a different experience.
123
Yeah.
124
I mean, the way that I viewed it is that it was really important to have a legitimate company in the cryptocurrency industry because it had been marred by so many scandals like Mt.
125
Gox and dark net markets.
126
And so I was really excited that Coinbase was taking the approach of, hey, we are regulated, we are going down the compliant routes.
127
And now, you know, they're part of the SP 500.
128
To me, this was a way of helping legitimize the whole industry and onboarding newcomers into the space.
129
So I was like, not, you know, I didn't like live and breathe compliance like before, but going through that process, realizing how critical it was to the company succeeding, I was happy to do that work.
130
And I also learned like through the process, yeah, like it is.
131
So, if I was a criminal, I wouldn't use a lot of these cryptocurrencies to be moving funds around.
132
Like, it's like it's all traceable.
133
And if people can't catch you now, they can maybe catch you like five years from now.
134
So, it was always something that I was like, I don't feel like this makes the most sense for a criminal to be using Bitcoin.
135
Yeah, yeah.
136
I've said this on the show before, but and I'm sure we've had prosecutors on the show say this, but I'm sure you know there are so many former prosecutors, federal prosecutors, who prosecuted crypto cases, and they'll all say things like, I would rather prosecute a crypto case than one involving the traditional banks any day.
137
And they would talk about how even to just get one hop in a transaction could take months from a traditional bank.
138
But, you know, with like the Bitfinex, you know, RazzleCon and Dutch, the way they like, you know, followed that, they could do it in real time.
139
And that just like blew their minds.
140
Yes.
141
Yeah.
142
That it's, it's, I mean, I think like when people talk, like, if they're anti-crypto, they'll be like, oh, there's all this like bad activity and money laundering.
143
And it's like a consistently point to like, well, people do that with, you know, the US dollar and they do that with cash.
144
And that's actually like way harder to trace and way longer of a process.
145
So I think, yeah, also goes back to like different perspectives.
146
You know.
147
So after you worked at Coinbase, you ended up founding a crypto VC firm, Scalar Capital.
148
Why did you decide to become a VC at that point?
149
Yeah.
150
So this was an era where like Ethereum was having like a bunch of these like ICOs on the network.
151
And it was a really interesting time where people were like, I'm building this decentralized project on top of Ethereum.
152
And I was just really excited by that as a concept of like, wow, if we extend this beyond just money and like, you know, the equivalent of payments, like we could apply this to everything, basically.
153
And so I wanted to just be able to spend my days like focusing on the cutting edge of what was being built in the space.
154
And so a VC role is great for that because you're constantly meeting with like the smartest founders and getting to your job is to just keep up with the space.
155
So I felt like that was something I wanted to do.
156
And I started with Jordan, who I worked with at Coinbase.
157
Did not really, like in retrospect, did not realize like what exactly like Intel's like starting a fund.
158
I think that process was like a very painful learning experience of like, okay, well, now people have to give you money to invest on their behalf.
159
And this was 2017 and there wasn't a ton of appetite for that on the institutional side.
160
And so I literally did 1,000 fundraising meetings and ended up with like 70 investors to get the $20 million fund going.
161
Wow.
162
And so like in retrospect, I wish I had learned more about the process where it's just like, oh, it'd be so fun.
163
Like my day is just spent researching all these cool tokens and projects.
164
And it was like, no, actually, you're just in institutional LP meetings all day.
165
So learned that process as well.
166
And so I'm assuming that's why you decided to leave and go back to becoming a founder?
167
Yeah, I miss the building side.
168
Like for me, just being like, first of all, like best part of the job is like just meeting with like the smartest people.
169
Like they're willing to talk to you.
170
But the part that was a little challenging for me was like, okay, now you're going to be spending time thinking about raising your next fund or getting that going or thinking through like managing LP relationships and making sure that they're going to be contributing more.
171
And that was just pulling away from the stuff I actually cared about.
172
Overall, I had a very positive experience for VC, but decided I need to be back on the building side and just hands-on.
173
Before we launch into what you're doing now, I did want to ask you because you talked about how you spent a month in Argentina.
174
And I know you were nomadic for quite a long time.
175
And I'm assuming you went to a bunch of different crypto communities globally.
176
So I'd just be kind of interested to hear maybe, yeah, what place seems to have the most crypto adoption to you?
177
Oh, I mean, so, yeah, I was nomadic for four years, and we would spend, like, my husband and I, Will, we would spend a month at a time in a different location.
178
And so we did the whole thing, like, people are saying there's the big LA crypto scene, there's big Miami, Austin, Argentina.
179
So we like Lisbon, we went to every place.
180
So people are like, there's a great crypto community here.
181
And for me, like, Argentina, like Buenos Aires specifically, really stuck out to me.
182
Like, that was where I just met so many people who actually use crypto.
183
And like, it is like in their genetics at this point to understand why something like this actually matters.
184
And so it just really resonated with me.
185
And I'm glad that DevConnect this year for the Ethereum.
186
And what were the four years where you were doing this travel?
187
I mean, I just settled six months ago in New York.
188
So it's four years up until then.
189
And I was just out of my backpack and living the nomadic, minimalist lifestyle.
190
So you basically started during the pandemic.
191
Yeah, it was right when people were like ready to leave their house.
192
And so the way it started was Will and I, we just left San Francisco to take a weekend trip to Santa Barbara because we've been cooped up for so long.
193
And we drove down there and then we were like, do you never, do you want to just like never go back?
194
And so we never ended up going back.
195
Wait, you must have gone back to like pack up your stuff.
196
No, I learned that you can actually hire people to pack up everything for you and put it in storage.
197
So I hadn't seen my stuff for four years and we were like, oh, maybe it's not even there.
198
How do we even know the storage unit exists?
199
We pay monthly.
200
So yeah, we literally never saw our stuff and never saw our place again.
201
Wow, that's so funny.
202
So I'm so curious because that really scrambled the crypto kind of community landscape in the U.S.
203
So what's your perspective on how the pandemic changed the crypto hotspots in the US?
204
I do feel like a lot of people ended up, like because you're not having to work an office anymore, a lot of people ended up just going wherever they wanted to live.
205
So SF, like, I felt like over time no longer became like the hub for crypto.
206
There's still a lot of people there, but I think it actually over time shifted to New York.
207
So that's, I'm, I'm living in New York now and like I literally run into people.
208
I don't know if that's good or bad, but it reminds me of San Francisco, actually, in terms of the crypto density here.
209
Okay.
210
Any other thing you want to mention from your travels during that time that pertains to crypto?
211
I mean, like Lisbon, or yeah, or I don't know where you went in Asia, or I don't think anything in particular, to be honest.
212
Yeah, it was just cool just meeting so many different people around, and there were crypto communities everywhere.
213
Like, I would go to Iceland, and I've met up with several crypto people there.
214
So, there's just crypto people, I mean, it's a global decentralized community, so it really reflected whenever I went somewhere.
215
That's so cool.
216
All right, so when you decided that you wanted to build again, how did you end up choosing to focus on Farcaster?
217
Yeah, so we built, my co-founder and I, Daniel, we built on top of Farcaster, so that was the first thing we did.
218
But to take a step back, knew that I wanted to go back to building, was kind of like casually looking for a co-founder.
219
I actually feel like for me personally, like co-founder matters like so, so much.
220
And that was what I wanted to find first before I had the idea.
221
I know a lot of people like do the other way around, and they're like, wow, I live and breathe this idea.
222
But like, for me, I'm not an engineer, so I definitely needed a co-founder to help me build it out.
223
And you're basically like married to this person for like a very long time, you know.
224
And so, for me, it was really important to make sure that we had values aligned.
225
Like, starting a company, in my opinion, is significantly harder than starting a fund, way, way more ups and downs.
226
And so, yeah, and it's a very important thing.
227
We couldn't align on like timelines.
228
One of them was like, oh, I'm actually, I'm down with crypto forever.
229
And I was like, okay, well, that doesn't work.
230
And Daniel, he used to work at 0x, where Will started 0x.
231
And so we were just eating a meal in New York for dinner.
232
And he was just talking about how hard it was to do co-founder dating.
233
He had already left 0x and had left Phantom already.
234
And he was just like, yeah, it's like so hard to find the right match.
235
And then I was just listening the whole time.
236
And then I asked Will that night, and I was like, is Daniel a good engineer?
237
And then Will was like, oh, he's really good.
238
And so then I just reached out to him.
239
And then we basically did the whole co-founder dating process.
240
So there's First Found has a set of 50 questions that all co-founders should ask each other.
241
So we went through all of that.
242
And you get to know someone really, really well through that process.
243
I highly recommend it to anyone.
244
And then we just did like hour-long walks, like daily for a long time, just syncing on values.
245
And we ended up deciding to work together.
246
And then from there, once we decided to work together, we came up with these, like, okay, here are all the things that we've wanted to see built in the past.
247
You know how like VCs have their like, you know, requests for startups list?
248
So I, I put, I had my list already of like, these are things I've always wanted to see built.
249
Okay, well, there's a reason they were never built.
250
Like, I went through that process and I speffed out a bunch of them and they were just not viable businesses.
251
It's like, this is a cool hackathon project.
252
And so that is something I also learned.
253
It's like, you.
254
So, we like narrowed down a few things of like, okay, these are things that we just aren't even interested in working on.
255
Like, they could be good businesses, but like, I'm not going to wake up every day getting excited by that.
256
So, we like knocked those out.
257
And then we refined it down to a few things.
258
And then we interviewed, like, okay, who's our user base?
259
So we would go reach out to like, you know, a small business, medium-sized business, large business, and see if this was something that even pay money for.
260
And those were no.
261
So we kind of like narrowed it down further.
262
And the one that like kept sticking was like building on Farcaster and building some sort of bounties product where you're helping people get paid.
263
Because the thing that is really beautiful to me about crypto is like, you know, the digital payments are global, permissionless, instantaneous.
264
And that means that if you are doing a really great job, no matter where you live, if you won the, you know, didn't win the geographic lottery, no matter where you live, if you're good, you can get paid out in crypto and build up a reputation for doing great work.
265
And so that's something both Daniel and I cared like so deeply about.
266
But this had been done a lot in the past before.
267
There have been like bounties platforms and it didn't end up working out.
268
So we felt like there was enough that had changed, specifically Farcaster, that would be worth trying again.
269
And what's amazing about Farcaster, so Farcaster is a decentralized social network.
270
So anyone can build on top of this network.
271
And so we've seen in the past with like Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, and other platforms, like sometimes people will build on top of them and they'll just get rugged, right?
272
It'll be like, yeah, we no longer support you or we're changing our pricing.
273
So it's really extreme and you can no longer afford it.
274
Farcaster is a network, like, why don't we try to do bounties on top of Farcaster as a go-to-market distribution?
275
So we did that for a little over a year.
276
And we got our first few thousand users going.
277
And it was like, we felt really proud of the product.
278
Ultimately, we were running to the issue of like, okay, now we just need more users.
279
And so we ended up joining the Farcaster team to accelerate user growth on top of Farcaster.
280
And so that's both Daniel and I ended up joining like two months ago.
281
Because like right now, so you know, both you and I have been in crypto for so long.
282
And as you probably recall, back when we first met, there was kind of just like a sliver of things.
283
And then now it's like, there are so many avenues.
284
So just to imagine you kind of, you know, making that decision, it's just so interesting how you narrow that down.
285
But you knew for, like, did you know that you wanted to do something that was more like a user app?
286
Or because you could have done, oh, I think I even heard you say in another interview that you were thinking about doing an L2 or like.
287
Oh, no, no, not an L2.
288
Oh my, that would be so hard.
289
Not an L2.
290
But we were thinking of infra for sure because we were willing to approach it from different angles.
291
Like I said, we narrowed it down and we were like, no one's going to pay for this.
292
And we just wanted to save our time really early and not even take that shot if we felt like no one was going to pay off the bat.
293
And then one thing, I spent a few, so I watched this A16Z talk that was really good.
294
And it was like, just run this exercise.
295
If this market were to 100x and you were to get 100% of that market share, is that still a viable business?
296
And there's a lot of cases where it's actually just no.
297
So running that exercise early on was really valuable in knocking some things out.
298
I mean, we ultimately, like, we weren't able to build like, you know, some giant company, but like, we certainly saved us some dead ends that we like knew for sure.
299
And this one was more of like, who knows?
300
And so, yeah, that was one approach that we took of just like, let's just run the knack and math like way ahead of time.
301
So, what are kind of like the main problems with social media today that you think Farcaster could resolve?
302
Yeah, if there's a few problems.
303
So, one of them I mentioned, like, developers building on top can just get frogged.
304
And I think that actually is a really painful process.
305
There's, you know, people spending like years of their time building.
306
They have many, many users, and all of a sudden there's platform risk where it's pulled out from under them.
307
And by that, you mean the classic example of like Farmville taking off on Facebook and then, okay.
308
Yes, exactly.
309
Or it could even be the platform seeing that you're doing so well, and then they're just going to charge you a ton because they know that they have that power dynamic over you.
310
And so we've seen this time and time again.
311
So I think that's just like from a developer standpoint, that's really risky.
312
And there was one recently where the Shapes team were building on Discord and they said they brought 100,000 users to Discord for building their AI agents.
313
And Discord just pulled them off the platform.
314
And so now that, you know, now that's like platform risk.
315
So I think from the developer standpoint, that's really concerning.
316
The other part that's really concerning too is like when you are a user just on like any social platform, let's say that you get kicked off the platform or you get shadow banned for some reason, which happens all the time on Twitter or X, you actually like to leave the platform, you have to now start over with your entire follower account, right?
317
Like no one, no one follows you over to this other platform unless you're like posting about it, but you're already shadow banned or banned, so you can't even continue to post about it.
318
Whereas on Farcaster, that I think is really, really special is that you have all of these accounts on chain where anyone can access this data.
319
So anyone can see who's following who.
320
And so any client built on top of Farcaster, so it could be like a Twitter equivalent, it could be TikTok, Instagram, Threads, like whatever, LinkedIn, all of them share the same follower graph.
321
And so as you switch across these different platforms, you're retaining your followers as you go to different platforms.
322
So let's say you're not even shadow banned, like, and you just want to start using the LinkedIn equivalent.
323
Instead of having to bootstrap everything from scratch, you can now just use this exact follower graph and just start with your same follower account.
324
And so I think that is just really powerful from a user perspective because distribution is so important at the end of the day for doing anything in the space.
325
And so I think from both developer and user standpoint, a permissionless social graph is immensely powerful.
326
Yeah, this is really interesting because I think of how, let's say that I discover somebody and I really start following them on like Instagram or something and I really like their content and then eventually I realize like, oh, they have a YouTube channel.
327
And then sometimes it's shocking.
328
Like I'll see, oh, the number of followers they have on like this one platform is like triple on the other platform or whatever.
329
Yeah.
330
So I imagine for them, it's kind of like, oh, you know, maybe I started this one platform later, but like I'm sure all my followers on the one would be interested in following me on the other.
331
Yeah, exactly.
332
And I have a concrete example where, so Coinbase Wallet is building a client on top of Farcaster.
333
And so it's in beta now and will be out in like a couple months or something.
334
But they're building like an entire social feed and social product within Quinbase Wallet.
335
So now when I make an account on Coinbase Wallet, it's actually the exact same follower graph.
336
So I don't even have to start from scratch.
337
So this is like already happening.
338
And I think over time as more and more people build clients on top of Farcaster, it's going to be really valuable to be able to just tap into that same user base.
339
And so one question is: you know, there have been news reports of different kind of blockchain-based, or really just blockchains that are trying to acquire TikTok.
340
So I have to admit, I haven't been following super closely like the flow blockchain's interest in TikTok, like how what they're planning to do with that.
341
And I don't know how closely you've been following it, but is that kind of a similar idea that you could port your users and things like that?
342
Or are there other ways of having a blockchain-based social media platform that isn't the way that Farcaster is designed?
343
I'm sure, I mean, there already exists other platforms out there that are decentralized structure, so I'm sure that that can exist.
344
I mean, I'm really excited by Farcaster for a few reasons in particular, and this is what I'm working on on the Farcaster team.
345
Like, this is what excites me so much: we actually have, so first, like, leaning into on-chain transactions.
346
So, by default, every user has a crypto address.
347
So, I think that's a powerful component that you don't even see on these like centralized platforms.
348
And this is global and instantaneous.
349
And so, Farcaster itself, like the team, we actually give out like $28,000 in weekly rewards for users.
350
And this just goes directly into their crypto wallets without them having to be like, here's all my, you know, like payment information, here's like my wire instructions, coordinating like, you know, cross-border and stuff like that.
351
So, that's really powerful.
352
And you see this like magical moment where people receive their first like crypto and they get really excited.
353
So, that part we're leaning into that I think that makes us really different than some of these like other decentralized social networks that maybe aren't doing on-chain crypto.
354
The other piece that I'm working on is like mini-apps.
355
And so, these are basically like WeChat or Telegram mini apps where you can just open up a full-on app within the social feed.
356
And so, this is like the early days of like Farmville on top of Facebook, but without Facebook being able to rug the Farmville developers.
357
And so, now we have this whole ecosystem of people building mini apps.
358
And it's really cool because now, in these like mini apps, when you open up the mini app, like it already knows who you are, so you're not having to like be like, enter your email address, and now, like, you know, check the email code that you just received.
359
Like, you just open it up, you can start using it immediately.
360
You have a crypto address connected, so they can start sending you rewards instantaneously, or you can just send funds to this mini app and make purchases.
361
So, that combination plus the social graph to me is like really, really powerful.
362
That makes a lot of sense.
363
So, in a moment, we're going to talk.
364

Here's another review of the podcast from Dutch Ladle on Apple Podcasts.
377
Dutch Ladle writes: I listen to about a dozen podcasts, none more journalistically, in the old-fashioned quality sense of the world, sound than Laura's.
378
She is a rock of Gibraltar in the killer seas of crypto.
379
If you want to hear a comment or a view featured on the show, leave your remarks on Apple Podcasts or read her a comment on an episode of YouTube, Farcaster, or X.
380
Back to my conversation with Linda.
381
In March, you announced that you were now going to work on growing Farcaster's developer ecosystem.
382
Why did you choose to work on that particular area?
383
Okay, well, first, I also said to Dan and Varun, because I was like, when I see something, and this is like Coinbase, I was, I'm all in.
384
Like, I will do anything for them.
385
Like, I secretly would have been like Dan's EA.
386
So, I was like, first of all, Dan, if you're lying, but this is Dan Romero, and Varun, is it Srini?
387
Srini Room.
388
Like, over a decade later, getting to work with them again.
389
We're both much older and slightly wiser.
390
So, yeah, so I was like, I know I want to work on Farcaster with them, like take any role.
391
But like here, you know, we did talk through like where I actually could be a fit.
392
And the thing that I was like really excited by was like the mini-app side.
393
And so I feel like that is just such a special component that does not exist like literally anywhere else in terms of the combo of like, you know, permissionless social craft plus on-chain payments plus the mini app.
394
And so to be able to like talk to developers and just help them build this out and like get distribution through Farcaster like to me is really exciting because like I went through that process already building on top of Farcaster.
395
And so that was really appealing to me.
396
And then it's actually like a pretty similar role to VC in a weird way because like you are just like talking to so many founders in the space and you are helping them just not with capital but with distribution, which in my opinion, distribution is going to be more valuable because capital, there's so many funds and you can kind of get that anywhere.
397
But we view it as like, the pitch has been, and I'm working with a lot of teams on this, is like get your first 1,000 users through Farcaster by building this mini app.
398
And when people use this mini app, they can then share it directly within the social feed.
399
So it helps with virality as well.
400
So basically, so did they just say this is where we really have a need and or something more interest?
401
Yeah, we kind of just like crafted it together.
402
It was really quick.
403
Like it was, it all happened within like a week or so.
404
And so we just put together like, here's Linda's role.
405
And it was just like listing out different things.
406
And I was like, I probably.
407
It's like, I forgot the exact quote, but it's like, if you're asked to join a rocket ship, you know, don't ask which seat, just get on.
408
And so that's kind of how I view Farcaster.
409
Like, I'm like all in, you know, double down on Farcaster because like I really think that this is just a much better situation for users and developers.
410
And so we just need to grind and like grow the network because it's only valuable as a social network if there's enough people on it.
411
And so right now we have like a really healthy user base of like, maybe it's like 60, 70,000 daily active users.
412
There's about 1 million accounts created total.
413
But that pales in comparison to the larger social media networks.
414
And so we as a team, there's 19 people on the team, just have to grind to get there.
415
And so to me, that's really fun to just get to grow it.
416
Yeah, is the theory that you will attract these developers and then they'll get creative and build apps and some of them take off.
417
And then for the ones that take off, they'll kind of go viral and then bring more users to Farcaster.
418
Is that kind of the theory?
419
Yeah, that's one theory.
420
And that's the side I'm working on.
421
We're kind of working in parallel of like, so Ted on the team, she's doing like new user onboarding, where it's like, okay, we're actually trying to onboard a lot of non-crypto people as well.
422
And so they've been bringing in journalists and different people who maybe won't talk as much about crypto.
423
Like I try to onboard my sister-in-law and like she just like the moment she landed on the page, she was like, I don't understand any of this stuff.
424
And so we're trying to improve that side of it.
425
And then the side I'm working on is, yes, I really believe that like people will come to Farcaster to use specific mini apps.
426
And we actually are seeing some of this happen at a small scale where people told me, like, so there's games like Farcade, which is literally you can just play like arcade games within these mini apps, or Farville is the Farmville equivalent.
427
And so people actually come to this, of course, they're going to recreate that.
428
They come to this to actually just play the mini apps and they don't spend as much time on the social feed.
429
So if we can bring in more and more of these, that's going to be compelling for users.
430
And if on top of that, you can start earning directly into your account for playing these games.
431
Like let's say it's giving you rewards for participating in like streaks or daily like prizes or something like that, you're going to keep coming back even more.
432
And when you have crypto payments, it's easier to facilitate that.
433
So I'm like so bullish on this.
434
Okay, yeah.
435
So you have like rewards.
436
You're trying to also like increase usage of the WarpCast wallet.
437
So that's all like with frames.
438
Yeah, actually, let's talk about that because that was kind of a breakout moment for Farcaster in the winter of 2024.
439
So describe what Frames is.
440
And then it looks like mini apps was kind of like a natural extension from that.
441
Yeah, so frames, so Frames V1 was announced and there was like this like huge excitement around it.
442
What it was at the time was four buttons and like a static image, which is what we actually had built our platform Bounty Caster using.
443
And so people kind of saw that vision of like, whoa, now instead of just like pure text, I can now have these like little applications where I can have people click on buttons, like do an NFT mint or send an on-chain payment or things like that.
444
And so I think everyone like kind of saw that vision.
445
But the problem at that time is, well, it is only four buttons and a static image.
446
And the image took quite a while to load.
447
And so there's no way you can actually really build anything close to what it is today, where we have mini-apps where it's a full-fledged, basically web app.
448
So you can convert any web app into a mini-app now.
449
And so the design space is immensely larger now.
450
And so you can have full-on games in this mini-app version.
451
Whereas Frames We won, you couldn't have had these kind of games.
452
Okay, yeah.
453
And so we've kind of talked about the problems that developers face on traditional social media platforms.
454
But there are certain ones it sounds like they're kind of already solved.
455
Like the thing about porting your users or your followers to different apps or things like that.
456
So do developers kind of just continue to reach out to you with new features that they want?
457
Yeah, they reach out with features we want.
458
We're doing a lot of work.
459
So Worbcast Wallet got released a few months ago, and that was a really big game changer.
460
It's an embedded wallet within the Worbcast app.
461
And so you actually, anytime you connect to your wallet, you don't have to get kicked out of the app to then connect something, which we've all experienced that pain point and then brought back.
462
There's a lot of user drop-off there.
463
So it's actually just a click within the app itself.
464
And so we think that that's a really powerful mechanism for developers to retain users.
465
And so we've been doing a lot of work on Worbcast Wallet and making it better.
466
And we actually are right now adding more chain support.
467
And so that's something we've been focused on because if you are a really good app developer, we want to be able to support.
468
So that's something we've also been working on as well.
469
We added Monad Testnet recently.
470
I've been chatting with a lot of developers in that ecosystem and have been really impressed by the developers there.
471
So that's been another approach that we've had as well.
472
And so how do you decide which chains you're going to add?
473
Yeah, so EVM is definitely the easiest because we already have that support.
474
Non-AVM is a lot harder, but we actually are like in the middle of looking at working on Solana.
475
So hopefully that should be ready as well.
476
But yeah, things like that just take a lot more work and we want to make sure it's a smooth experience for people.
477
So the team is so, so good.
478
Like I really want to emphasize how fast the team ships.
479
Like they like to add like a non-EVM like wallet and mini-app support, it's been like the timeline has been like the two-week kind of mark versus months.
480
And that's a result of the structure that Farcaster team has had where, I mean, just for context, most of the people on the team are staff software engineers.
481
So they actually just are very autonomous and can kind of just like run something from start to finish.
482
And then a lot of the people that were hired recently too, which has been really cool, is like former founders building on top of Farcaster, like us.
483
And so people are just like so stoked to just like see Farcaster grow and just like ship really fast.
484
So anyways, so we're working on it.
485
But yeah, the timelines are in the weeks.
486
So at the end of March, Farcaster launched Snapchain.
487
Explain what that is.
488
Yeah, so all of the accounts that were created on top of Farcaster.
489
But when you actually have all of this cast data and who's following who, we use another layer called Snapchain.
490
And so you can kind of think of those as just nodes in the network that people are running to then access this data.
491
So developers can run their own nodes in Snapchain or there are services like Nainar that help developers run for them.
492
We used Nainar when I was running my company.
493
And so Snapchat, you can kind of think as this blockchain node layer that stores all of this decentralized social network data.
494
Okay.
495
Yeah, I didn't know.
496
So on Dune, it looks like some of the different little kind of actions on Farcaster, like a cast or a reaction or a link, there were these big drops suddenly, like at different points.
497
But I didn't know if it had to do with the rollout of things like that.
498
Like if that was kind of making some of that more efficient.
499
Yeah, it might have been the rollout just because this just got released and we're still making improvements to it.
500
So I'm not sure exactly the reference there, but like I would say there's going to be more like stability and improvements like in the future.
501
But the team that ships Snapchain, which is literally like a blockchain, is two people.
502
So it's just insane.
503
Wow.
504
Well, so as you mentioned, you guys are so you're you know, Farcaster's on Optimism.
505
And just the account creation is on OP Mainnet, but then everything else is chain agnostic.
506
Okay.
507
Yeah, so so that's how you support all these other different chains.
508
But, you know, do you find that like most of the developers that are interested are also Ethereum developers?
509
Or like who?
510
So I think that there's a really, really strong base community.
511
And they've done such a great job of helping consumer app builders and just growing their ecosystem.
512
So I'm not surprised at all that there's such a heavy base community.
513
I am also seeing a lot of developers reaching out to me that are from the Telegram ecosystem actually that have been like, we're being kind of like forced into the ton ecosystem and we just want to be able to reach users without worrying about like them pushing us into some ecosystem.
514
We're interested in building on top of Farcaster.
515
There's also people that are in other ecosystems, the whole in crypto that are like, we just want users for our app and we're built on these other chains.
516
That's the most important thing to us is distribution.
517
So it's really like a wide mix, but at the end of the day, if you're building a consumer app, the single most important thing is getting your initial user base.
518
And so it's a really hard cold start problem.
519
And we went through that ourselves of like, hey, like now I've released this app and now I'm just going to start posting about it non-stop and like getting people to download it or use it.
520
But if it's within something like Farcaster, where it's, you know, you're never leaving the app, a user doesn't have to drop off and like download something.
521
It's using the wallet that's already embedded to participate in the app.
522
And then users can now share the mini app within the feed.
523
Like we help with that virality for these users.
524
And so this has been like a really huge selling point for a lot of developers.
525
Plus like Coinbase Wallet is being a Farcaster client as well.
526
So they have millions of users.
527
So you're just getting in front of so many more users as a developer.
528
I was also wondering, so for these different developers, like, you know, when you talk about the ton developers, I was thinking earlier in the conversation that some of what you were talking about reminded me of that.
529
But, so it feels to me, like, Farcaster and the ton ecosystem are starting kind of with the same goal, but like, it's super, like, your advantages are like very flipped or something.
530
Yeah, it is.
531
And ours is different in that it's like we do have this like social feed.
532
Like, people are coming to the app just to use the feed just like you would Twitter.
533
And so, you're meeting users where they already are.
534
I'm not like going through Telegram personally beyond people messaging me to just spend a lot of time there.
535
Like, I know there are a lot of people that do mini-apps, but like, I spend way more time as a crypto Twitter user on a text-based social network.
536
And so, the idea is like meet users where they already are.
537
But, yeah, I have played around with a bunch of Telegram mini-apps, and they do look like a lot of them are really cool.
538
But, yeah, the ton ecosystem push, like I think that's just really hard for developers because they just want to not have to be pigeonholed into some ecosystem there.
539
So, I noticed in your Twitter feed, you're doing things like live streaming your onboarding sessions and stuff.
540
How do you think about your job?
541
What are kind of all the different ways that you think about approaching your job?
542
Yeah, I mean, I think that it really is important to explain to people why Farcaster is valuable to them either as a user or developer.
543
And I definitely acknowledge like it's off the bat you're like why would I switch to a way smaller social network if I already have a following on Twitter.
544
And so like I just do a lot of just like public educating in the space.
545
And if I'm already having like the same conversation with someone, might as well live stream it.
546
That's how I'm thinking.
547
And then people can watch the video if they have the same kind of questions.
548
Like for example, really common questions that people ask is like, why is it called Forecast?
549
Like why am I downloading Warpcast?
550
But the network's called Farcaster.
551
And so we then have to be like, oh, well, it's actually the client built on top.
552
And then you start getting to this decentralization angle that we've talked about.
553
But if we can actually make it easier to just have people download the app and just like start using the product, like that's going to reduce drop-off and confusion.
554
So we're actually in the process of like, okay, we're going to rename Warpcast to Farcaster in terms of the app so that now when people hear Farcaster, which already has the most brand recognition, they go to the app store, they just download Farcaster, and then they don't get confused.
555
So having more and more of these conversations is really valuable.
556
For example, having a lot of conversations with developers, trying to get them to build on Farcaster, they were like, what is a frame?
557
Like what's a Farcaster frame?
558
I've never heard of that before.
559
And I was like, well, it's this, you know, like the web app, you convert it.
560
And then if you just use the term mini-app, a lot of developers are familiar with that term because they've seen that in Telegram or World or somewhere else.
561
And so just like terminology matters a lot.
562
So like as we have more and more of these like conversations, I think just like realizing where there are drop-off points is really valuable.
563
And so yeah, that's kind of how I think about approaching.
564
Like, are there things that are like potential quick wins of like explaining?
565
Okay, yeah, I do feel like there's just a lot of ways that social media exists today.
566
That I almost realize that in a Farcaster world, those distinctions may not exist or be needed.
567
And so, you know, earlier when I was talking about like Instagram versus YouTube, or we could even think about X, like right now, already X is, yeah, it's mostly text-based, but people put like full-on podcast videos in there, like we do.
568
Or, you know, they'll put like little mini shorts where, so it's kind of like a mix between YouTube and Instagram and or TikTok or whatever and text-based.
569
And so I started realizing, like, oh, the way we think of our current social media, where it's like videos are on YouTube, and then, you know, shorter form visual content is on Instagram or TikTok, and then text is on X.
570
Like, on Farcaster, I could see those distinctions maybe not even happening that way.
571
And so, do you like, like, I almost, what I'm trying to say is, like, we talked about how Farcaster is trying to solve for this problem of like, you want to be able to port your users wherever you go.
572
But could it, couldn't it also just kind of build this sort of like app where there's multiple different ways you could use it?
573
And so then you wouldn't even need to port your users.
574
I mean, you could, but it is really hard to be really good at a lot of different things.
575
Like, I think the same team that's building TikTok maybe is not as good as building LinkedIn because you just have a really different audience and vibe.
576
So I do think that there are going to be specialized clients and platforms.
577
They're leaning way more into videos than we are doing on Workcast.
578
And so that's actually really cool where users can discover videos a lot better than we're doing right now.
579
And so I think that each client is going to specialize or just have different ways or opinions of approaching how they want to interact with their users.
580
And I think that's awesome because now the user just has more choice and they don't have to like worry about losing followers wherever they go.
581
So I think that's just giving users the choice.
582
Okay, so since you spend a lot of your time exploring the different mini apps and things, what are some of the mini apps that you're most excited about on Farcaster?
583
Yeah, there's so many, honestly, because I could talk about this for hours.
584
But one of them that's that's just going viral right now within the feed is actually just like crossword, like a New York Times Crossword Puzzle equivalent mini app.
585
And so people are just like racing and there's a leaderboard.
586
And what's cool is like because anyone can pull in the social graph, the leaderboard built by the developer just pulls in like all the Farcaster users automatically and what scores they got.
587
And so people have just been like comparing like their scores and like competing against each other.
588
So that's been really fun.
589
And I'm like so bad at crossword puzzles.
590
And so it's been fun seeing like I literally am like 10x worse than like some of my teammates.
591
And so that's been like just going like completely viral.
592
In terms of recent mini app that I've gotten really excited by is Pay-per-view.
593
And so they're actually doing a mini app where you can pay to unlock content.
594
And so you can pay people to like five cents to view a photo or to like view any like writing that they are doing.
595
Because I'm just paying through my WordCast wallet.
596
I never had to leave the app itself.
597
I'm able to now do an on-chain transaction that's like five cents.
598
It would not be worth any other platform to be facilitating.
599
They live in another country.
600
They're receiving these funds instantly into their wallet.
601
And now I'm able to unlock this content and view it.
602
And then once I view it, I can now share that image into my feed for other people to unlock.
603
And I can earn a percentage of that revenue from people using my link to view it.
604
And I just receive micropayments from that.
605
So I think that is just like a use case that highlights what's powerful about crypto and permissionless social really, really well.
606
The other one that I play regularly is Fargesser, which is like GeoGuesser, but built on top of Farcaster.
607
So every day there's a geographic location that it shows like a very small snapshot of it and you have to guess where that is.
608
And so that one's really fun to, yeah, also similarly there's a social leaderboard and you can, there's literally a map where you can see where everyone guessed with their like little Farcaster profile icon.
609
And you can just see like how far off you are with your friends and things like that.
610
Is that like that Google Maps person who can freakishly look at a set of pixels and then know where in the world that is?
611
Or is it literally like an image of the place?
612
It's an image of the place.
613
I have no idea what you're talking about.
614
There's literal competitions for GeoGuesser where people can just like in a moment, it's just like grass and they're like, this is like, this isn't Russia.
615
Like and it's just like, I don't know how they do this, but it's the equivalence game on Farcaster, which is really cool.
616
And then there's others like DeFi, like Morpho has a mini app where you can deposit your USDC and start earning yield on it.
617
I showcase that a lot because it's like, hey, like, never have to leave the app and you now are just like earning yield on your USDC and it's like 6% yield.
618
So there's a lot of different apps right now that I'm super excited by.
619
So it's like, I feel like it's a dream job just to be able to like play around with mini apps all day and like talk about something I'm already so excited by, which is like crypto and Farcaster.
620
So dream job.
621
So you are Farcaster's third most popular user.
622
What advice would you give to people who are interested in joining Farcaster?
623
I didn't even know that I was, but I looked this up on Dune.
624
Oh, wow.
625
Okay.
626
Yeah, I didn't even know.
627
But I mean, the advice is like, yeah, just treat it as like any other social network where you don't just want to shill for something and not like engage with other people.
628
But one thing on Farcaster is like people are so, so nice.
629
So it's a result of like also just like an early community, but also Dan seeded the community by literally getting on video calls with like the first few hundred Farcaster users.
630
And so it's just built like a really nice like user base of like the most followed accounts are generally nice people and not people that just like rage fate and just get a lot of followers.
631
And so it incentivizes like it like nice behavior.
632
People sometimes call it Christian rap.
633
And so we're trying to work on like, it's okay to have it be like hot takes every once in a while.
634
But anyways, my point is like because people are so nice, like I think that works really well where it's like if you're helping others, like if they have a product and someone's launching a mini app, you can reply to them, use it, give feedback on the product.
635
Like, you're connecting with builders directly, and some of these are like really great builders, VC funded, and you can give feedback and support others, share things that you've learned, kind of treat it as a way of just helping others in the network.
636
And I think that that lands really well.
637
Because I'm always building in public, like when we're building Bounty Caster, it was all about these are the pain points we're running into, and this is how we're thinking about things, and we don't have an answer, but like, this is like the struggles you have as a founder.
638
And there's like a founder's channel, there's a channel for basically everything, and you kind of like document your journey of just building public or doing something in crypto in public.
639
And I think those kind of things land really well.
640
And actually, I was curious: do you feel like most people on Farcaster are more like Ethereum community members?
641
Because that was definitely the perception for quite a while.
642
And I don't know if that's still currently the majority of the community.
643
Yeah, that's definitely the early user base.
644
But as we've been expanding to more chains, and that's something that I've been working on directly, we are bringing in more ecosystems to me.
645
Like, if like we really should be getting like the entire crypto community onto Farcaster, like, if we want to have conversations that are actually meaningful about crypto and moving the space forward, like having it only be like a segment of the community to me is such a, it's a kind of a waste, honestly.
646
And so, like, bringing in like all kinds of different voices is really valuable.
647
So, over time, it's not going to be just Ethereum.
648
And I think that's valuable in the same way that people, as much as they hate crypto Twitter, still spend a lot of time on it because that's where there are so many different voices and perspectives.
649
So, over time, that'll change.
650
And do you know kind of what the percentages of users are?
651
Oh, I mean, that is like the vast majority right now.
652
Like, I don't even have the exact percentage, but it's like you land in the feed, and right now, it's more likely to be an Ethereum user for sure.
653
Okay.
654
And then, just this bit about like people being nice on a platform.
655
I'm sure you're very well aware there's been a lot of criticism of like the direction that X has taken, where it feels like it's kind of more rage baite-y.
656
What are you guys prioritizing in the algorithm in Farcaster?
657
We're not even like prioritizing the algo in that sense, but it's like the most, like, it's like you're seeding this like early community of really nice people, and those are like the most influential accounts.
658
So, to get them to engage with you is not going to be through like rage baiting.
659
Like, so I think it's just like it's like a behavioral community aspect, where it's like, imagine, like, it's like you're, it's like, there's like 50 really nice people, and then you're like a super mean person.
660
You walk into the group and you just start yelling at all of them.
661
Like, they're going to be like, whoa, like, why are you doing that?
662
You know?
663
So, I think that it's just a matter of community and how it was built early on.
664
And so, yeah, I don't think it's an algo thing.
665
But another thing that also I think helps a lot is sharing links on Farcaster.
666
You don't get de-boosted in the algo.
667
And so, that allows people to cross-pollinate ideas as a whole.
668
And it's like okay to push people out to different platforms if they want.
669
And so, I think that also lends to like more sharing.
670
Like, I'll share like, you know, like Reddit articles, a Reddit post that I read or news article I read.
671
And, like, that just helps with more sharing of ideas versus just sheer rage bait text.
672
Yeah, yeah.
673
So, last question is just about the identity of Farcaster.
674
You know, there are elements of it that are similar to us and elements that are more similar to Reddit.
675
Why were those the two social media platforms that you decided to emulate?
676
So, this was done like well before I joined the team, but in terms, I would say it's like closest to Twitter by a long shot.
677
The Reddit piece comes in because there are channels in the network, and so you can kind of think of that like as a subreddit.
678
So, if you're really into gardening or you live in New York, you can join the New York channel.
679
And so, this is where it's like a Twitter feed, but contained in a certain topic where everyone has the same interest.
680
And so, that kind of reminds people like subreddit, but by far, people treat it more as like a Twitter than a subreddit, subreddit.
681
But that's kind of how I explained channels.
682
But not everyone uses channels.
683
Okay.
684
All right.
685
What have I not asked you that you would want people to know about?
686
No, I feel like it was very comprehensive.
687
I'm just really passionate about Farcaster, and like people can message me anytime, like on Twitter or on Farcaster itself.
688
I'm at Linda on Farcaster and at LJXIE on Twitter.
689
