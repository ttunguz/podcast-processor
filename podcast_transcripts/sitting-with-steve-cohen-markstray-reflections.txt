1
So?
2
Let's start with the present moment, Steve.
3
Yeah, let's start.
4
This year has been defined by a persistent tension.
5
Are we in a recession or not?
6
Is this a bull market or a bear market?
7
How do you see it?
8
God, if you asked me that question a week ago, two weeks ago, I might have given you a slightly different answer.
9
I mean, the whole thing with Trump and what happened with China was a little bit of a surprise to me.
10
I didn't expect things to unfold the way they did, you know, where it basically capitulated.
11
But it's still, I look at it pretty simply as far as is this, we're not in a recession yet.
12
I think we are going to have significant slowing growth.
13
We think it will probably be like a 45% chance of recession, right?
14
So that's not insignificant.
15
Even if it's not the definition of recession, it's definitely going to be slowing growth.
16
And so I think it's almost unavoidable.
17
When you add up the tariffs, you add up the 10% rate, sectoral tariffs, and whatever happens with China, you're probably going to end up somewhere in the, I thought it was going to be like the 16 to 20 range, and now it's probably lower, 14 to 17 percent rate, perhaps.
18
That's hard to know, hard to be exact when things are jumping around like they are.
19
But we think growth is going to slow, and we don't think the Fed is going to act right away because they're still going to be worried about inflation from tariffs.
20
And then next year we think growth is going to be in the 1.5%, maybe lower range, which is okay but not phenomenal.
21
And then the question becomes: what kind of multiple do you put on these numbers?
22
And so, you know, I would call it much slower growth, but I'm not, you know, the chance of recession have lessened given what's happened recently.
23
Is there anything about this moment that feels familiar when you look at the price action?
24
Yeah, I mean, it feels, you know, we had that, I mean, we've seen other periods where you've had significant drops and then the markets somehow rally in a significant, I mean, this is unusual for something like this to happen, where you drop significantly and rally back as quickly.
25
I mean, the closest thing might have been a pandemic.
26
But, yeah, I mean, I still think multiples matter here and growth is going to slow.
27
And what I'm looking for is, yeah, the markets have rally.
28
It's great.
29
We may see some more deals.
30
That's great.
31
I want to see when the data turns down how the market's going to react.
32
And that will tell me a lot about whether we're priced correctly or not.
33
And, you know, obviously, if the markets hold up when the data turns down, then you've got to go, wow, what's going on here?
34
I'm not convinced that's going to happen.
35
Now, I don't expect a significant decline.
36
I think it's possible we can go back toward the lows, which is 10, 15 percent, so it's not a calamity.
37
And what Trump did recently actually raises the floor and eliminates perhaps the dire scenario.
38
And so, but I just view it as we're sort of in the trading range for a while.
39
So, what changes the most in terms of how one should think and act in this environment?
40
Yeah, I think, I mean, I'll tell you how my PMs think.
41
I mean, we came into 25 and they had a phenomenal 24.
42
Multiples went up, everything worked.
43
And I was trying to get them to think that we're in a different regime, and what worked in the past is not going to work this year.
44
Obviously, names that are data-dependent, that are impacted by these tariffs, you've got to be careful here.
45
A lot of them have rallied back significantly.
46
But with slowing growth, and like I'll say it again, multiples being on the higher side, I think that's kind of a mix that doesn't give you much upside.
47
Obviously, each sector is a little bit different, but on an index side, I'm a little bit more up here, a little bit more conservative.
48
So, it's a sideways market.
49
I think so.
50
I think we're going to be, there's no, like, markets don't have to go up every year.
51
I mean, like, there's no, like, it felt that way for a while, but you know, when you look back in history, markets can go sideways, and that's perfectly normal.
52
Hold on here.
53
I thought I'd turn my phone off.
54
All right, there you go.
55
When the noise gets loud.
56
That was an important call.
57
I should have taken it.
58
Anyway.
59
But when the noise gets loud, what do you trust first?
60
Your analysis, your instincts, the tape?
61
Well, I think the first thing is your analysis, right?
62
I think it all comes back to facts or what you perceive to be facts.
63
And then the second part is, I think, pattern recognition, right?
64
I mean, it may not exactly look the same, but if you've been around for a while, and I've been trading markets for almost too long, but like 47, 48 years, you've seen a lot.
65
And so there are moments that look that.
66
Has it helped you, or have you found a way to overcome it?
67
I mean, you always have doubt.
68
I mean, the way I equate it, you know, I own a baseball team, right?
69
And I've had some of the greatest players in baseball, and they go through slumps.
70
And they start to doubt themselves.
71
And so when things aren't going right, the only thing you can go to is go back to your process.
72
And what is it?
73
Are you doing your process?
74
And sometimes, you know, nothing's 100%.
75
And so I can have ball players and they go, oh, for 20, and yet it's okay because they've been hitting the ball hard.
76
They just got unlucky.
77
And so it gets back to you're not going to always get it right, but if your process is consistent and you believe in your process, you can always have self-doubt.
78
I mean, that's a whole nother topic, right?
79
I mean, you could be doing phenomenally, you have two bad days, and start to have self-doubt, right?
80
You've got to remind yourself that this is going to happen and it's perfectly normal.
81
And just like when ball players go through slumps, you're going to go through slumps too.
82
There's also often this need to keep proving yourself, especially when expectations rise after a great run.
83
So for the people you mentor, how do you help them manage the sort of internal or self-imposed pressures?
84
Well, I'll go back to 24.
85
I mean, our PMs all had years that were, a lot of them that are 50, 75% of normal average.
86
So now they get into 25 and they're starting to put pressure on themselves to.
87
Instead of that, what I would say is you say thank you, you know, for an environment that was fairly easy to make market, make money.
88
But the reality is that's not the way it normally works.
89
And so you've got to be a little bit more pragmatic and a little bit more, just, you know, I always say, you know, I don't create the world, I got to live in the world.
90
And if the world gets presented to me, that's more difficult.
91
You've got to lower your expectations.
92
What else have you found in terms of common limiting beliefs, self-sabotaging patterns that hold talented industries back?
93
Yeah, I think, you know, I mean, I've run into all types.
94
I mean, some people, they hit a certain number and they've made a certain amount of money.
95
And somehow making that, they have some notion in their head that making that type of money is they're done.
96
You know, like they accomplished what they wanted to accomplish, as opposed to the people who are passionate about what they do and constant, you know, adapting, evolving, constantly learning new things, where it's about challenging yourself, right?
97
And I mean, the beauty of what we do for a living is dynamic.
98
It's always changing.
99
And so the ability to kind of embrace that and enjoy it for what it is and not feel like, you know, I'm done.
100
I'm at a certain point.
101
There may be people around you that say, oh, you know, what do you need it for?
102
I had people along the way.
103
I was building my business.
104
You know, you're doing just fine.
105
What do you need to keep going?
106
Because they don't know what it's like to take it to the next level and to build something.
107
Maybe they've never done it.
108
They don't even know what the experience is like.
109
And so, yeah, there's always people around there that are people.
110
You have these notions.
111
I keep coming back to that internal conversation, the notions in your head that somewhere you learn that may not be true.
112
It just may be something that you thought was true or something someone told you, but doesn't necessarily mean that's the way it is.
113
Have you ever hit an upper limit in your own journey?
114
It doesn't mean you have to work your way through.
115
Yeah, I mean, there's always moments when you take the foot off the gas a little bit or give yourself a break, right?
116
And I just find that boring, though.
117
Unless I'm hardwired, I can't help it.
118
If I start slacking off, then I start reminding myself what it takes and then get back on the horse and get going again.
119
But then when did you realize that success doesn't guarantee peace?
120
Well, I mean, you know, you can be successful and be miserable.
121
You know, like I know plenty of people like that.
122
And so, right, and I'm sure you do too.
123
And I mean, peace is something else.
124
You know, peace is being happy in your life, being enjoying what you do for the sake of doing it.
125
You know, having people around you that care about you, that you care about them.
126
You know, sort of building.
127
I mean, if everything's just focused on work, well, when you're working with a lot of work, great family, you know, and so I can go home and feel comfortable and safe and happy and laugh, and that just makes it so much better because then when I go back, you know, when I go back to work, I'm feeling good, rested, feeling good.
128
You know, I don't have these other stresses that other people may have, and I think that's probably been helpful, really helpful, in being able to do the things I want to do.
129
Let's touch on that, because what people admire publicly is made possible by how we spend our time in our private moments quietly.
130
So, what role has home life specifically played in helping you sustain your drive and allowing you to perform at a high level over the years?
131
I keep coming back to it.
132
I have such little stress at home, okay?
133
I mean, you know, I have a great relationship with my wife.
134
We like, we love spending time together.
135
And so, this is my second wife.
136
My first wife wasn't that way.
137
Okay, so I mean, I call that my blue period.
138
But, you know, it was just the opposite.
139
And so, when you're stressed, and you know, let's say you have a stressful job.
140
I mean, there are times when you're under stress at work, whatever reason.
141
Then you're stressed at home.
142
That's hard, right?
143
I mean, it's hard to deal with all of it.
144
And, you know, you're a human being.
145
How much stress can anybody take?
146
And so if you can eliminate or make your life better in the places that are, you know, that are important to you, and it just allows you.
147
Is there something you appreciate more now than you did earlier in your career?
148
I mean, listen, as I get older, I'm much more appreciative of everything.
149
I mean, I can pinch myself.
150
I'm a lucky guy.
151
I mean, I don't know how this happened.
152
I mean, I know I worked hard, all that good stuff, but it didn't have to turn out this way.
153
And so, yeah, I'm just love everything I'm doing right now.
154
And yet, I've expanded what I do and give myself time to explore other things.
155
And it's just a great place to be.
156
It's been a year now since you stepped away from the screens.
157
If you were to look out the next five years as a chapter in your life, what will be the central theme?
158
Wow.
159
You know, I mean, it's weird because I'm going to be 69, right?
160
And so time is not forever.
161
And so I'm much more cognizant of where I spend my time, what I do with my time, making sure that I'm spending it with the people I want to spend it with.
162
You know, there's no time to waste.
163
What else comes to mind?
164
As far as what?
165
In terms of what's important to you in the next five years?
166
Oh, I mean, I don't know.
167
I want to win a World Series, right?
168
That would be kind of fun, right?
169
I mean, you know, I think at this point, it's more about, I mean, the whole Mets thing, as an example, is taking advantage of doing something.
170
I said it at my original press conference to do something that.
171
I mean, no one would run a sports team the way I'm running this right now.
172
Okay, I mean, it's a little insane, okay?
173
But it's worthwhile because when I go to the stadium, when I go see people's faces, when I see how much enjoyment they're getting out of the team, out of being, you know, following the Mets as an example, and I mean, it's cool.
174
And it doesn't just have to be running a hedge fund.
175
There's so many different ways, so many different, the skills that I've learned running a hedge fund is now I can do in so many different places.
176
And as, listen, I'm out here speaking.
177
I never used to speak.
178
I was petrified to get out in front of an audience.
179
And now, like, I don't care.
180
And I mean, I'm actually like, yeah, sure, happy to do it.
181
You know, I call it now I'm on the rubber chicken circuit.
182
But it comes from stretching yourself a little bit, doing things that you never used to do that don't feel very comfortable, and then realizing, hey, I could do this.
183
And that's kind of fun, you know, and it's kind of empowering.
184
It kind of emboldens you to go, okay, what's next?
185
And so, you know, I'm trying to build at the stadium, trying to win the casino license and build a hotel music venue, 5,000 seats, you know, with my partner, the hard rock.
186
And it's going to be a tremendous project that's going to employ people, that's going to, you know, create a destination around the ballpark that New York doesn't have.
187
And as an example of taking some of the skills that I have in one place and transporting to another place and making something happen that seems impossible, but might just happen, which is kind of cool.
188
Let's end with a few quick hits to say the first thing that comes to your mind.
189
Yeah.
190
Right now, the market feels toppy.
191
The part of the process you cannot skip is preparation.
192
Great preparation takes care of a lot of potential mistakes.
193
When a young investor faces their first real drawdown, the most important thing to remember is that it's not the end of the world, right?
194
Like, guess what?
195
Everyone has scars in the markets.
196
And guess what?
197
You should take it as a badge of honor.
198
One thing I'm still trying to figure out.
199
One thing I'm still trying to figure out.
200
I don't know.
201
I mean, I deal with a lot of people, and trying to figure out what's going through their mind is a tough thing to do.
202
The habit that has made the biggest difference in my career is.
203
Habit.
204
God, I'm relentless.
205
It's just, I'm hardwired.
206
You know, like, I just don't give up.
207
I mean, I've gone through some trip, you know, stuff along the way that wasn't fun.
208
And, you know, I'm still here and doing stuff that I'm excited by.
209
And I'm just tenacious.
210
I can't help it.
211
If the real game isn't money or markets, but becoming who we're meant to be, what would the younger Steve be most proud of, not in terms of what you've achieved, but in terms of who you've become?
212
God, that sounds so a little bit of bragging or something.
213
Yeah, you know, it's not about me anymore.
214
You know, it's about how I affect other people and how do I do things that are bigger than me.
215
And I consider myself irrelevant.
216
It's about everything else.
217
Steve, thank you.
218
Yeah.
219
Not just for sharing your practical wisdom on how to navigate this market, but on what it takes to navigate a life in this market.
220
Thank you, Chiro.
221
Thanks, everybody.
222
Keep going.
