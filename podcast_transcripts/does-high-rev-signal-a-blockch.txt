1
So what are we arguing here?
2
That fees are going to go to zero and REV is a useless metric.
3
I don't think REV is a useless metric.
4
I also don't think it's the only thing you should value a network on, of course, right?
5
But like, look, if all I tell you about a country is you can be born in a high GDP country or a low GDP country, which one would you pick?
6
Generally speaking, you want to be in the place where there's more economic activity.
7
And that's why REV is important.
8
If you're thinking about like a discounted cash flow model or revenue model, you are never going to value these assets the way that I think this industry or folks in this industry think they should be valued.
9
Because I believe that these fees are across the board going to zero.
10
Hi, everyone.
11
Welcome to Unchained, your no-hype resource for all things crypto.
12
I'm your host, Laura Shin.
13
Are you leaving comments on social?
14
We read every one, and some of them end up on the show.
15
Today, we have some comments responding to my recent interview with NYU professor Austin Campbell on the stablecoin bill's ban on yields-bearing stable coins.
16
On X, AAMA in turn said, Stablecoins should innovate for user benefits, not just banks.
17
Also in X, Zero X RWA said, If the Senate allows yield-bearing stablecoins, credit costs in the entire USA economy will shoot up.
18
Not a great economic policy when T-bill yield is already flirting with 5% barrier.

26
Here to discuss are Tom Dunlevy, head of ventures at Various Capital, and Austin Federa, co-founder of DoubleZero.
27
Welcome, Tom and Austin.
28
Thanks for having us.
29
Hey, happy Memorial Day.
30
This podcast was sparked by a debate that Tom and Austin had on X, and they tagged Haseib Qureshi of Dragonfly Capital and the shopping block to moderate.
31
And we initially were going to co-moderate.
32
However, Hasib claimed that he was sick and asked if he could bail.
33
I actually also developed a gigantic headache after we had that conversation, so ended up sleeping a fair amount during the time that I was supposed to have been writing the script.
34
So we'll see how well I managed to do.
35
And Haseb also sent questions.
36
So, okay, before we dive into this debate, let's just define what REV or REV is.
37
Tom, do you want to start?
38
Sure.
39
For me, and I think for Blockworks, which really defines REV as the seminal metric that they like and others, I think, should use and have a lot of others have used, is MEV plus transaction fees on these networks, which primarily today is the execution fees they have on top of L1s and L2s.
40
Yeah, first let me start with the disclaimer that Dragonfly co-led are round.
41
So Hasib's questions, if they seem biased, you know, you can blame him for that.
42
And then I would say for Rev, like, it is an evolving metric, I will say.
43
We don't have great economic metrics in the macro standard world, let alone in the crypto world.
44
But yeah, it is a combination of MEV, it is a combination of transaction fees, priority fees, other protocol-native incentives on a protocol, or functionally protocol-native incentives like MEV systems.
45
And then, you know, depending on some metrics, you can include some form of app revenue on that as well.
46
But the standard basis usually doesn't include that.
47
Okay, so I'm actually going to reveal at this point that both Hasib and I, when we were kind of chatting about the questions, we were trying to look at everything, but actually, if anything, the bias was more the other way where we kind of landed on hmm, like it doesn't feel like it's stacking up that Rev is that important, but we'll get into all that.
48
So let's just actually talk about one other thing for a moment in terms of this definition or what's included.
49
And this is a question that comes from Hasib.
50
He said, why do we think it's appropriate to include out of protocol payments such as Jeeto tips if those payments aren't getting internalized by all holders of the native token?
51
Well, I guess let me start off with this.
52
Protocolization is just a fancy term for nationalizing stuff.
53
Ethereum has done this a lot.
54
There's stuff that starts out not partisan's core protocol spec and then it sort of gets nationalized, right?
55
The same way that the Mexican government might take over the railways because it's very important.
56
And we don't really do that in the United States.
57
And so, but we have a lot of things that are integral to the functioning of, say, the Department of Defense that are not part of the U.S.
58
government in the explicit sense.
59
And so I do think there's a little bit of wiggle room for things.
60
I mean, I think 85% of Solana's stake runs JETO at this point.
61
So, it is not a permission system or a protected system.
62
It is a system that any staker could participate in simply by choosing a validator running the software.
63
I think it's very different than including something like trading fees on Uniswap or pump.fun revenue or something like that, because those are fundamentally, they're not exactly permission environments, but they're much more restricted and they have kind of more verticalized benefits.
64
Tom, do you have any comment on that or further question?
65
Yeah, so I think more broadly, the point here is that if you're not staking, you're not getting a lot of these fees, right?
66
So, 65% or so of Solana folks are staking on a much lower validator set than someone like Ethereum, who has roughly 30% stake.
67
Other networks have varying degrees.
68
But I think the first caveat in a lot of these cash flow metrics is it's only going to a small portion, and potentially for some of these networks, a larger portion, but still not the whole portion of the network, which then does not have direct value accrual to the entire base of the asset, whether it be Ether, Soul, or whoever.
69
I mean, you could expand that out in a lot of different ways, right?
70
Like that in that method, we maybe shouldn't include staking.
71
We shouldn't include inflation as a cost, right?
72
Because that's only going to a certain percentage of holders, in a sense.
73
So, I think we have to kind of look at like opportunity and availability, right?
74
Like, you are like, the treasury rate is still meaningful in the United States, even though not everyone has exposure to treasury to get yield outside of staking and outside of exposure to these core protocol or almost core protocol systems.
75
Like, if you can get 14% on a lending pool, that's going to beat MEV and transaction fees and staking rewards on Solana.
76
That doesn't necessarily mean that there's no benefit to the protocol from that, right?
77
So, if we were to take your analogy there with the U.S.
78
government, I would say you actually would have a direct tie, even if you don't own treasuries, because you own dollars, which are effectively yield-bearing treasuries, which is how I like to think of these things more broadly, is effectively as nation-states.
79
And these are the underlying currencies for the nation states, perhaps with some commodity-like qualities that these things depend on.
80
And the underlying value generated by these little nation states is the economic activity built through the users, the transaction volume, et cetera, and all of the future volumes and values that you think will come in the future, but not just some one individual level of cash flow today, right?
81
Like, if you were to look the U.S.
82
government cash flow today, that would be a very sad story, and you would not want to invest in the U.S.
83
government and buy treasuries or buy dollars.
84
So, you have to think about the confluence of the economic activity on these networks and what is going to be there in the future.
85
Yeah, I guess just one other thing, too, is like the way you talked about the staking example, you know, that is inflating the supply, which is, it's like it's affecting the overall token.
86
It's not just going to the validators in some kind of like, like it is affecting all users rather than.
87
The way you described that, it seemed like you were saying, like, you know, this is only affecting these people, whereas like the JITO tips is, that's not quite the same thing.
88
JITO tips affect everyone who is staking to a validator using JITO, which is the majority of like the 25%.
89
Yes.
90
So I think maybe this is like a good place to draw like some definitions, right?
91
Because, you know, if we're thinking about what affects supply, right, there's inflation and there's burn.
92
And those are the only two things that go into that, right?
93
And so there was a world back in, and I guess like lost tokens, right, in some ways, but like there was a world back in like, you know, two years ago or so where the burn with Ethereum exceeded the inflation rate, right?
94
And that had an effect globally on token holders.
95
And that was a, you know, a deflationary pressure.
96
Now that's no longer the case, right?
97
So if what we're really talking about there is like the only things that we can include in a metric is net net token issuance, whether positive or negative after burn or inflation is applied.
98
I mean, that's sort of one way to look at it, but I don't think that tells like a complete economic story because there's a lot of networks that have that dynamic, that have functionally zero economic activity taking place on them.
99
And if we're going to call those like an apples-to-apples comparison, I don't think that's a useful metric at that point.
100
So I don't really think the inflation rate matters a whole lot, to be honest, which is like a contrarian point of view.
101
I think between two and six, seven percent, whatever we land on is fine.
102
That's the denominator of these assets.
103
I mean, that's the inflation rate of most.
104
Like, yes, it'll it'll matter, but this year, these are like high-tech growth startups or countries, whatever you want to call them.
105
So, the very small inflation rate you're going to have in single digits is not meaningful in my mind.
106
What is meaningful is understanding like what we're evaluating them on at the top level, so like disaggregating what we mean by those fees that we got in briefly in the beginning.
107
So, this is the part where I start to like break down what the folks who are looking at long-term fees and discounting them today and saying, Great, like, these are going to be investable assets based on this, um, these principles.
108
So, if I just look at transaction fees, today, globally, we have 200 to 250 million daily active transaction fees occurring in equities.
109
If we're charging a penny on that, like you know, roughly so on is today, the goal I think is a tenth of a penny.
110
That's two to three million in revenue in the future.
111
Great.
112
Yeah, so we get to a billion dollars.
113
Very low, very low.
114
If we expand that to all transactions, global credit card transactions worldwide, this is my recent Capital One study.
115
We have 2 billion in terms of aggregate transaction volume.
116
That's 20 million days in fee and a day in fees at a penny.
117
Again, probably going to go lower if that's the goal.
118
That's only $7 billion annually in fees.
119
So, we add those two together, we do all of the world's equities, all of the world's credit card transactions, we get to something like $10 billion annually in transaction fees in terms of just execution and fees.
120
And I'll pause there, but we can go to the MEV fees too.
121
And if we're looking at the aggregate value of all L1s today, which is $700 billion or so, if you're looking at $10 billion in fees in the future, steady state for everything, and versus $700 billion in assets, you can see why the numbers are really hard to make sense at a 70X revenue multiple.
122
Sure, but that's actually not what the transaction fees and equities are.
123
If you're looking at the exchange-build fees, certainly, but there are so many forms of ancillary monetization that are effectively fees in equities, right?
124
You get into lit pools and dark pools and HFT firms with what they're doing with both market making and trading.
125
And then you get even more than there into the infrastructure side of the actual investments and advantages and capital that goes into things like microwave towers, shortwave, private fiber.
126
I know I've gotten pretty deep in that in the last few years.
127
But, you know, but when we look at these types of things, I think it's not exactly like on centralized trading venues, what we see every time trading fees are lowered, volume skyrockets, right?
128
These are sort of, this is the thing you see on CME or NYC when they drop the fees.
129
And what that does, that creates a lot of revenue, a huge amount of revenue through things like HFT firms that are now able to make trades that wouldn't be economically profitable before because of the trading fees.
130
And so we can look at that and say, are we, if what we're doing here is trying to put a value on how valuable is the New York Stock Exchange as a company, not as a trading venue, but as a company, sure.
131
I think that's a totally viable way to look at it, which is why to get back to this whole thing where people are like, Ether needs to be worth a trillion dollars to have $999 billion of assets on it.
132
I think that's totally wrong because that's not the way that any centralized venues work on this.
133
Okay.
134
We've kind of moved past a little bit of just the rev, but I think these things are very related.
135
I do.
136
So let's do this.
137
I do have one more question.
138
And then I want to get, we've already kind of moved into the debate portion, but I want to officially move into it.
139
So, and this goes to where you were headed because it's sort of like you know, one other thing here to define is just how do we appropriately apply this metric to Ethereum, which also has all these roll-ups.
140
So, you know, what do you guys think on that score?
141
I could start by saying I don't think any L2 should have tokens.
142
Everything should be settled in Ethereum, should be one base layer.
143
You're already paying all the call data fees in Ethereum.
144
Eventually, the sequencers are all centralized.
145
We haven't made people argue with me, but I don't think we've made real meaningful progress on that in a very long time.
146
And all these tokens are not worth anything.
147
But that's a contrary view.
148
So I don't know.
149
How's it going?
150
I'm actually 100% aligned with you on this.
151
Spicy view.
152
No, I'm perfectly aligned with you on this.
153
On Twitter, and people will be mad at me for something that you said.
154
But anyway.
155
Well, that's always the whole point of the chopping block, isn't it?
156
But I actually completely agree.
157
If you're not going to use it as a gas token and you're not going to have any meaningful form of governance that isn't controlled by one centralized entity by virtue of running one sequencer, I'm not really sure what any of these tokens are doing.
158
I mean, base has got a run rate of, what, about $750 million in Ether fees in the last 12 months.
159
Like, sure, it would be nice for OP holders if some of that got burned.
160
Burn runs 80% of the volume right now on Ethereum L2s.
161
Yeah.
162
To go back to your definitional question, Laura.
163
Sorry, just on this piece.
164
Like, I think if, for example, that would be a slightly different story, right?
165
And that's where I actually think, like, the question is kind of like, what can your average Joe do if they deploy the native asset of the token using like pretty bog standard methods in order to generate some form of yield, income, revenue, however the tax people want to define this stuff?
166
That for me is like the fundamental question.
167
And we can bring that lens to bear on Ethereum, Solana, XRP, pretty much anything out there.
168
Okay.
169
Okay.
170
One last question, though, and maybe this is more for Tom.
171
Like, because we are in this world where there's all these L2 tokens, like, how would you account for that?
172
I said we should retire them all and denominate a native-based asset.
173
I mean, that's like, again, super controversial.
174
But, like, what purpose of these things?
175
I don't want to go off on the tangent, but what purpose of these things served before governance votes are really minimal?
176
They're accruing revenue directly to a handful of individuals.
177
Like, they're not sharing that.
178
Like, I just, they're not preserving any of the decentralization qualities that tokens are actually built for.
179
And they're effectively 90% profit margin on Ethereum right now.
180
So, like, I don't get it personally.
181
And so, would you, so Max Resnick was on the show and said something like: if Ethereum were a company, then a CEO would come in and quote-unquote fire all the L2s.
182
So, like, now that they exist and many of them have tokens, like, what would you propose?
183
So, actually, we're already firing the L2s in a sense that we're moving towards base roll-ups on Ethereum, which is natively enshrined execution and sequencing on the base layer.
184
So, like, they're sort of firing L2s, but it's just kind of taking time.
185
So, I don't know what the role of the L2s is going to be once base sequencing comes in a year or two.
186
There's some social consensus, I guess, advantages in having those, but I would do what Coinbase does effectively.
187
Like, Coinbase does not have a token or base does not have a token.
188
We should retire all the other ones, move to sort of the base model.
189
And that would be my view.
190
Interesting.
191
Okay, okay.
192
So, now we've spent like 17 minutes on just the definitional part, so we have to get to the debate.
193
But why don't you just each kind of lay out your main argument?
194
So, I'll just harken back to the initial post that sparked this whole thing, which was Tom's tweet, in which he said, Any L1 fees are a meme and going to zero, in my honest opinion, REV or otherwise.
195
What matters is the amount of value you secure as a chain and the downstream economic security needed for the L1 asset to justify that security.
196
So, go ahead and elaborate on your view on this.
197
Yeah, so it goes back to a little bit what I said earlier.
198
So, if you're thinking about like a discounted cash flow model or revenue model, you are never going to value these assets the way that I think this industry or folks in this industry think they should be valued.
199
Because I believe that these fees are across the board going to zero for some of the execution fees that we talked about, even priority fees, even MEV.
200
And we can unpack why I think that going forward.
201
So, if you think these assets have value more broadly, you have to come up with new and interesting frameworks.
202
These are brand new assets.
203
I think we should come up with new frameworks.
204
We are.
205
So, the only metric that I could come up with with why these total assets should be valued commensurate to billions or trillions of US dollars is they have to be tied to the economic security of the underlying assets that actually transact and are built on that network.
206
So, today, if you're building on Ethereum, as Austin noted, you know, does it matter if Ethereum has a billion dollars of economic security or 100 million or a trillion?
207
Well, the answer would depend on what you're actually building and what it's worth and what it's worth to attack Ethereum, the chain that you're actually building on, and affect consensus to meaningfully disrupt your business.
208
Now, that's not going to be a trillion dollars if Ethereum is worth a trillion dollars because it doesn't cost that much to affect consensus.
209
And presumably, it's almost impossible to try to do that, right?
210
So, like, there's some middle ground there.
211
So, is it if Ethereum secures a trillion, maybe it has to be worth 300 billion or 200 billion?
212
It's a moving target.
213
But tying the underlying value of the assets to the economic security of the chain is a pretty reasonable and meaningful metric to me, and it's not something you can do in equity world.
214
If I, you know, you can't say, if I acquire more Apple stock, I'm going to take over the company and stop producing all iPhones and have no revenue going forward, right?
215
You would maybe go in and say, Okay, I'm going to change some things about Apple and I'm going to keep it important.
216
I could presumably take over one-third of SUI or something, stop finality, maybe even get to 51%, and disrupt some of the biggest individual assets on that chain.
217
So I think the analogies are very different than equities.
218
The security portion is something that's very different in blockchains than it is in our great world.
219
So, I mean, I think you're right that we need to think of these things in slightly different ways.
220
But to me, this kind of just feels a little bit like digital mercantilism.
221
Like, we just need more of the thing because that's where the economic security comes from.
222
The economic security of Ethereum does not come from the market cap, right?
223
Like, here's the question.
224
Is Ethereum less secure today than it was in November of 2021?
225
Certainly not, but does it have the same amount of economic activity it does then as well as lower market cap, right?
226
It has lower economic security.
227
So this is the challenge.
228
Like when Ether was down at, what, $1,800 a few months ago, it was not half as secure as it is today, right?
229
These arguments don't actually scale.
230
Because in some ways, if you look at the cost to attack Ethereum, it is almost certainly not acquiring Ether.
231
It is almost certainly hiring enough hackers to find bugs.
232
It is a nation-state-level attack, which is code-based, it's not economic-based, because the vulnerabilities in all of these systems are undiscovered code exploits, which even Bitcoin has.
233
They're still patching Bitcoin Core every once in a while.
234
And so the cost to attack Ethereum or Solana or SUI or pick your smart contract network isn't actually acquiring enough hash power or acquiring enough asset to actually attack the chain.
235
It's acquiring enough software engineers, right?
236
It's still very hard to attack it, but as we've seen, North Korea is not a rich country.
237
They do not have a lot of economic force to put to bear to effect change, and yet they're actually quite effective at compromising a whole series of different types of protocols.
238
Now, there's a whole other way to look at this.
239
Social engineering, so it's not quite just somehow the way it is.
240
It's the same thing.
241
Like, if you hack the New York Stock Exchange because I find a code exploit in the exchange and it managed to steal a bunch of stuff, or because I stole someone's password via social engineering attack, they're both attacks on that institution.
242
It doesn't matter if I cracked the quantum security code to launch the nukes or if I did it because I social engineered someone.
243
What matters is there's suddenly nukes flying.
244
You were talking about it's a very direct linear relationship between price and like what the underlying asset should be valued.
245
I'm saying that underlying asset relationship to the market cap is certainly evolving.
246
But if Ethereum was worth less than the total value of the assets secured, or better said, if it's lower than the biggest asset it actually secures, then there is incentive to actually attack the network to presumably get some level of value from that asset.
247
I'm not saying it's a one-for-one.
248
I'm not saying it's a one-for-10.
249
I'm just saying there's a serious, there is a causal relationship there.
250
Yeah, I don't think I would deny that there's some form of causal relationship there, but I don't think, I mean, for starters, there's not that much Ether actually on the market, right?
251
So if you think about cost to attack as like, what would it actually take to acquire this much?
252
In theory, I can spin up enough hash power to attack Bitcoin, and no one knows until the moment I flip the switch live, right?
253
In theory, I could have an entire Kazakhstan of miners sitting out there somewhere.
254
But that's not possible on proof-of-stake networks, right?
255
The act of acquiring enough Ether to attack Ethereum or acquiring enough Sol to attack Solana would send the asset price so astronomically high that effectively you gain more economic security in the process.
256
And the cost to actually attack Ether, if you wanted to run a, let's say, a 30% attack on it, would drive the price up to $20,000 a token because there just isn't that much supply.
257
Which is why it's not one-for-one.
258
If it was only one-for-one, but that doesn't mean that the security necessitates a price increase, right?
259
This is the piece that I think is like, as an investment thesis, to say if we are going to have, let's say, $10 trillion come onto Ethereum and trade on Ethereum, ergo, the price must go up.
260
That's where I start running into issues.
261
As a reason to say that Ether is going to go up in price because there's more assets on the chain now, right?
262
This is especially not true for real-world assets where the assets aren't really even on the chain, right?
263
If you add up the sum total of like everything that trades on Ethereum today, let's exclude the L2s.
264
Let's just look at the L1s.
265
I would be pretty sure it's more valuable than the market cap of Ethereum.
266
Yeah, I'm not sure if we would have to look that up.
267
But I think so.
268
So the way that you responded to Tom in that tweet was: you want the sum total of stuff built on the network to be worth more than the network.
269
You want iron beams to be worth more than the mines their raw materials come from.
270
So you're saying that, like, I guess what I'm a little bit confused by here is: so, Tom is saying that he thinks like the security needs to have some kind of relationship to the economic activity or the value of the assets on the chain.
271
And you're also saying that you want the same, and it should be more than the value of the network.
272
Yeah, I'm saying that if you need Ethereum, Ether, the sum total of the market cap of Ether, to be more valuable than the, let's just say, like the largest BlackRock fiddle fund deployment or the largest stablecoin deployment on the chain, if those necessitate a direct relationship there, right, and that you need Ether to be worth more or 50% as much, this is extremely capital inefficient, right?
273
If we required banks to have one-to-one deposits or even 50% deposits, right, this is the fractional reserve banking is what generates huge amounts of wealth and capital liquidity and movement in America.
274
And if we, and that's because fundamentally, like the security of the banking institution is not the one bank that you're banked at, right?
275
And so it's a sort of, again, like I hate these analogies because they all start to break down pretty quickly.
276
But if it would be unsafe, right, effectively what the argument is, it would be unsafe to deploy multiples of Ethereum's market cap on Ethereum today.
277
I don't think that is a message that is accurate nor one we should be touting because like that it just these systems don't work that way.
278
Their security doesn't come just from that.
279
Yeah, let's take the converse of that, right?
280
If you were to have Ethereum be much, much, much less than individual assets that are built on the chain, then the attack vector is there to presumably attack those assets.
281
So, I agree with you.
282
It's pretty capital inefficient for that to be one-to-one, one to ten, one to a hundred.
283
I don't know.
284
And that's where the complication comes in these valuation models.
285
There is a tie there.
286
I think we agree on that.
287
And then the additional incremental value that Ethereum has at the asset to get to its monetary value, we need to add those things on, right?
288
It's commodity value.
289
Great.
290
It's using settlement on the L1 layer.
291
Great.
292
There's probably some monetary premium for holding that.
293
That's a little fuzzy.
294
There's probably some consensus premium there too.
295
But that's where you start to get the incremental things that you should value these assets on.
296
It's not the only thing.
297
It's one of the things.
298
The thing that I'm saying is less valuable than all those other things is fees.
299
Because fees, as you noted earlier, are detrimental to network effects, which overall grow the things that I think matter, which are growing users, growing applications, growing value on the network.
300
And so, Tom, just to understand, you know, if, as you said in your tweet, if you think fees are ultimately going to zero, then how will security be financed?
301
So security will be, so right now, you know, what are Ethereum stakers getting paid today?
302
It's effectively zero.
303
And there's still, there's still a million, roughly, of stakers who can, there's mining pools, whatever, right?
304
There's a there's a lot of them out there because they still have economic interest in securing this broad network that they're doing activity on.
305
And this, this, this then gets into the argument is: okay, how much economic security and how much decentralization is enough?
306
My argument would be we're probably there already.
307
At this point, you know, these people are not doing it for the percentage they're getting in terms of fees and revenue and you know, inflation or whatever.
308
They're doing it because they have an economic interest in the broader network.
309
And then there's, of course, other people who said, you know, are doing it because they believe in decentralization and all those properties, whatever.
310
There will always be people out there like that.
311
But I would argue we've already reached those levels.
312
Respectfully, I don't think that's why anyone's staking Ether.
313
I think they're staking because they think Ether is going to go up in price and they want direct exposure to the asset.
314
They don't want to hold something else.
315
And if they can get...
316
I wouldn't have to stake to do that.
317
I could just hold it.
318
I'm talking about the 0.5%, 1% yield.
319
Yeah, why would you not?
320
Right?
321
Like, this is, this is, like, there's no reason, if someone can offer you a 0% interest rate or a 1.5% interest rate, and again, because of the way this works, there's not very much risk in staking.
322
Like, no one's going to not take it, right?
323
Especially if you're a large institution that holds a significant balance sheet, that 1.5%, that covers your custody fees, suddenly.
324
How much did the Ethereum staking rate drop when it went from 7%, 8% to effectively 2%?
325
And the answer is it grew slightly.
326
So I think you going from 2 to 0 would...
327
Not too many.
328
Personally.
329
I could be wrong.
330
On inflation rate.
331
Sure.
332
But what I mean is, I don't think people are...
333
You sort of asserted that people are holding Ether because they want to secure the network that they do other, sorry, they're staking Ether because they want to secure the network they do other types of economic activity on.
334
I have seen nothing in the history of crypto that shows that altruistic self-interest, altruistic, let's better the network, you know, is pervasive in the space.
335
50% of Ethereum nodes are run on AWS or other cloud providers, right?
336
Like, you know, Lido has all the keys and can run away with your Ether at any moment, right?
337
There's a lot of these types of components where like what we what we don't actually see here is people acting out of some sort of altruistic value structure for this.
338
I think what they think is they think Ether is going to $10,000 and thinking at 1.5% yield versus 0% yield, they're going to do it.
339
So I don't think that's.
340
So I think the biggest stakers on Ethereum are the restaking providers, their Coinbase, a lot of those bigger entities.
341
And are they doing it?
342
They're doing it for their underlying customers, yes, but are they doing it because they're moonboys?
343
Like if they're doing it off their balance sheet, probably not.
344
I think a lot of these, almost all of these actors are doing it because they have some broader economic interest in securing the network.
345
So in a moment, we are going to talk more deeply about REV in particular.
346
But first, a quick word from the sponsors who make the show possible.
347
Hi, I'm Matt Hogan, CIO of Crypto Asset Manager BitWise.
348
Look, crypto can be confusing.
349
There's so much noise and the space changes so quickly.
350
That's why, every week, I write a five-minute memo on the biggest stories impacting crypto in plain English.
351
Why is Bitcoin up or down?

358
We have another listener comment in response to my interview with Austin Campbell on the stablecoin bills ban on yield-bearing stablecoins, in particular, our discussion on why older lawmakers don't get stablecoins.
359
On X, Mr.
360
Samuel, said, Imagine surviving the dot-com bubble just to fear a savings account on chain.
361
Senator Warren still thinks Venmo is cutting-edge tech.
362
Let us know your thoughts on the podcast overall or on a specific episode by writing a review on Apple Podcasts or with a comment on YouTube, Farcaster, or X.
363
Back to my conversation with Tom and Austin.
364
So I actually, I just, you know, I feel like we're veering a little bit away from this REV question.
365
And I'm just going to quote Zero X NGMI, the founder of DeFi Llama, who tweeted: quote, since Ethereum has roll-ups, many of which are first-come, first-serve, and do not have MEV.
366
Sorry, this is my paraphrasing.
367
It's not a quote.
368
And since Ethereum also has more MEV protection, such as on CowSwap, it's natural that Solana would have higher REV.
369
So, Austin, do you still feel that REV is a good metric to judge Ethereum by?
370
Like, his point was like, this is just apples to oranges.
371
That's what he was saying.
372
Ethereum used to have REV, right?
373
Like, it used to have significant amounts of it.
374
And then there was a conscious decision made to push execution off onto the L2s and to do a bunch of things that basically like pushed all of the value creation onto the L2s.
375
So I think Ethereum used to have REV.
376
I still think it actually is a decent metric to evaluate it by being.
377
It is giving you less than US dollar inflation.
378
Now, people hold it for mostly because they think the price is going to go up at some point, at least back to 2021 levels, if not way beyond that.
379
So you don't, like, there's another argument to be made here, which is that the high REV on Solana is a reflection of kind of like how immature the chain is, just how much newer it is in its development compared to Ethereum.
380
You know, things like I mentioned about the MEV protection on Cowswap and stuff.
381
You know, there's many ways that Ethereum is trying to protect against MEV.
382
And so, you know, do you would you expect that Solana's REV over time would go up or down?
383
And what would you want to happen?
384
Would you want it to go up or would you want it to go down?
385
It's a good question.
386
So there are right now, like Jeeto has a bunch of parasitic mev prevention systems that they use.
387
There are still what you would call sort of like, you know, rogue like relayers out there that are doing things like sandwich attacks.
388
It is a very low percentage of validators, but they can make a lot of money doing that, right?
389
Sandwich attacks are quite profitable and are just detrimental to pretty much everything on a network except those individuals.
390
MEV is not bad.
391
Like I don't know where this is, like as soon as Ethereum lost MEV, everyone decided it was bad, it feels like.
392
It's like saying HFT is bad, right?
393
High-frequency traders are not a negative.
394
So, I guess the question is, I'm one of those people that think it is negative for users, you know, by and large, for retail users, I should say.
395
You know, I know Tarun has his arguments about how if you don't try to exploit it, then you end up with inefficiencies.
396
But, you know, I do think basically, depending on where you're sitting, you know, and to my mind, like trying to prioritize the desires of like an everyday user over kind of like the more institutionals, I think, especially because like they just come in with inherent advantages.
397
And so, trying to lessen that gap rather than widen it is a worthy cause.
398
I mean, the fees that users pay on like name-brand DEXs on Solana or SUI or Ethereum nowadays, not in the old days, are lower than the fees retail pays on any centralized exchange.
399
So, I think we have to kind of be a little bit like, what are we really talking about here?
400
Like, we should be very mad at Coinbase and Binance if we're upset about MEV-related fees on other L1s, which is not to say that it's like the goal.
401
I think over the, like, look, it depends on what you're making fees on, right?
402
The fundamental reason that there are things like priority fees on Solana and the reason that what you see is you see like Geeto tips used to land specific transactions at specific moments are because you have fundamental hotspot problems in all of these systems, right?
403
And when you have it in the REV system, it's internalized.
404
When you have it in TradFa, it's externalized, right?
405
The priority fee that is paid at the New York Stock Exchange, first off, there's your co-location space, which is quite expensive.
406
And then there's your priority data feed from them, which is quite expensive.
407
But a lot of those costs are actually externalized onto things like private fiber, shortwave, and microwave tower providers.
408
And so basically, your argument is: if they're going to pay this money for these advantages, then it might as well go to the chain.
409
Is that what you're saying?
410
100%.
411
I would much rather have the sort of value chain of execution, especially for professional traders, be internalized into the economic system than externalized.
412
Yes.
413
Tom, do you want to respond?
414
A lot there.
415
A lot there to go into.
416
So I think MEV inherently, most of it, isn't that bad, and that is front-running and sandwich attacks, which is something like 50% plus of most MEV, at least on Ethereum and Solana today.
417
I think that is hard to argue.
418
It's not net bad for end users.
419
Things like SexDex Arbitrage and other things that have better price discovery, I think that presumably is good MEV.
420
And I don't think that goes away.
421
I think all of the quote-unquote bad MEV that I mentioned earlier goes pretty close to zero.
422
So you're having a lot of technological advantages that make this happen.
423
So you have private dark tools, as Austin mentioned earlier, coming on chain.
424
Private order books, ZKTAC is making a lot of these things obfuscated before they're actually entering the mempool.
425
So very, very close to going.
426
So, that is what I think Multicoin and others coined the gold standard of like, here's what MEV could be in the future.
427
So, across all of finance today, HFT firms in aggregate in revenue only make about seven to ten billion dollars every year.
428
And that's by a Chicago booth study.
429
That's not me just like pulling a number out of the air.
430
And there are a number of others who like range in that sort of range from seven to ten billion.
431
So, if that's like the gold standard in traditional firms and that's what we want to ascribe to, I still think that number falls very short of adding to the number I mentioned earlier on transaction fees and aggregate looking at how we provide some level of multiple to making this basis.
432
But again, to my earlier point, I don't think that that's going to happen.
433
I think these are going to, MEV in aggregate is going to be reduced pretty close to zero as we have a lot of these technological advances that we keep along with.
434
And Austin, just to make sure I understood, so over time, you want Solana's REV to go up?
435
Yes.
436
So, the short answer there is yes.
437
Okay, I do.
438
And there's more we can go into that.
439
I also agree that things like parasitic mev are going to very low percentages over the next few years.
440
Completely agree on that.
441
Okay.
442
And so basically, in that regard, like you're saying that you expect that things like sandwich attacks will lessen?
443
Yes, I do.
444
Okay, okay.
445
But I don't, I disagree that.
446
I also would say Jane Street's profits last year alone were, or revenue last year alone was $20 billion.
447
So there's no way that's all from high-frequency trading.
448
I mean, most of the stuff they do is prop, arbitrage, things like that.
449
Prop trading is still high frequency, but yes.
450
Not to be directional.
451
It doesn't have to be high frequency.
452
Totally.
453
Yeah, I mean, folks can look up the study I mentioned, just Booth, HFT, and you can look at the profit.
454
It's very hard to estimate these things, right?
455
They're all private firms.
456
As you mentioned, yeah, it's very hard.
457
Okay, well, so I guess, like, so you're saying that you would expect that even as Solana matures and infrastructure matures, that at that time, the trajectory for REV would not look the way it's looked for Ethereum where it's gone down.
458
You would hope.
459
Yes.
460
Okay.
461
I would say it would not, because Ethereum, like Ethereum chose to offload all of its execution onto layer twos.
462
And so if you look at, like, for example, where does the $750 million in sequencer fees that base takes in a year go, right?
463
That doesn't show up in your traditional way of looking at this stuff.
464
But if, for example, when we get back to based roll-ups, I expect the REV of Ethereum will go up when we switch everything to based roll-ups.
465
Tom, do you think that's not what's going to happen?
466
I agree.
467
That's my earlier point.
468
I totally think Dell 2 should come on board and.
469
I just think the fees are going to zero still.
470
It doesn't matter.
471
It's L2, L1, because it's net parasitic for the network.
472
And it's the history of literally every technological innovation ever.
473
So just to understand here, if we're all saying that sort of the parasitic MEV will go away, but you're also saying the fees will go away, then where is the security coming from?
474
So there will be, I think when I said it's going to zero, I meant very, very close to zero.
475
And to our earlier point, the security, I think, is already at a baseline level that is sufficient in my mind.
476
And I don't think folks are doing it for the net revenue they're actually gaining from staking right now.
477
And stinkers are the owners of the network.
478
So you would say that the security budget of Ethereum comes from charity in the future.
479
Absolutely not charity.
480
It is based on the economic aligned interests of the individuals who are staking.
481
That's charity.
482
How is that charity?
483
Because if I'm in Coinbase, and I have, you know.
484
It's not in Coinbase's interest to stake their Ether, then, right?
485
Like, you have to assume that these are rational, self-interested actors, in which case, if I can have someone else secure the network and not have to do anything myself, as a profit-driven corporation, I will always pick that.
486
As a self-interested actor, I will always pick that, right?
487
This is like, if that were the case, like, we would have solved climate change in the 80s.
488
So I think there's a lot of consensus broadly to figure out here, but there's already a broad level of security on the Ethereum.
489
And the reason, to me, is that they have an economic interest and they need to secure, who want to secure, these huge assets that are already building on top of it with many, many more coming.
490
So, I mean, that I think is secondary, though, to the broader point of do you think these fees are going to zero for the two major buckets, which are revenue and MEV?
491
And it sounds like you think they're going to grow, and I'm not sure why.
492
So I think if you think they're going to zero, you also have to think the price of Ether is going to crash, right?
493
Because there's, look, people hold these assets because they think they're going to be more valuable than they are today.
494
If you polled institutions in crypto, if you polled individuals who hold crypto, like please, in the comments section, let me know if you hold Ether because you think it's going to go down and you want to secure other assets you're building on the network.
495
That makes no sense.
496
That's not my argument at all.
497
I'm saying if Ethereum one day holds $100 trillion, let's call it, let's go extreme.
498
Why would the price go up?
499
Why would the price of Ether go up if?
500
Because you need to secure the $100 trillion attack vector that is there.
501
So that could be $100 trillion.
502
It could be $10 trillion.
503
I don't know what that is.
504
But I'm just saying, it can't be zero.
505
It can't be zero.
506
That's an argument.
507
We'd all be on private blockchains.
508
I know we wouldn't even have crypto.
509
Correct.
510
So this is an argument not to say, this is not an argument not to say the price of Ether needs to go up.
511
This is an argument to say institutions will not feel comfortable deploying significant amounts of capital until the price goes up.
512
Those are two very different things.
513
Like you've created a causal link here that says if more assets come on chain, therefore the price will go up to secure it.
514
Why would the price go up?
515
Are institutions buying Ether to secure other assets they're bringing on chain?
516
That's extremely capital inefficient.
517
So, okay, here's a positively reflexive argument, right?
518
So, if I wanted to bring assets on chain today for all of the advantages we know blockchains have, what are my choices?
519
And this has become an Ethereum versus Solana argument, which I didn't want it to be.
520
But could I bring it to Ethereum?
521
Could I bring it to Solana?
522
Okay, where am I going, right?
523
If I've made the decision to go on chain, I'm already going to say which chain am I going to use.
524
So, that's the first decision point that these folks are making.
525
Or I could do a private blockchain, which doesn't have a token, holds everything, right?
526
So, but the decision point is between these ecosystems.
527
So, I think they're making that decision already, regardless of the other people.
528
I mean, Securitize just announced support for Solana as well, right?
529
Like, these institutions, there are like PayPal's building stuff on Solana, right?
530
They're building stuff on other networks as well.
531
Like, I don't think it's fair to say that just because someone started on a specific network means that's where they're necessarily going to keep deploying everything.
532
But, this is, again, these arguments are, I think, structurally backwards, right?
533
Like, if we require security for something to be deployed, right?
534
It's like, you know, if you decide, look, I'm going to move my family to Cape Town, because it'll mean Cape Town has to get safer.
535
That's not the way it works, right?
536
You move to a place because you think it's safe, not because your presence necessitates an increase in.
537
It's I'm moving to Africa.
538
Where do I want to move in Africa?
539
Cape Town's the best town.
540
Great.
541
That's exactly, I mean, you know, Cape Town has better restaurants.
542
Cape Town has better infrastructure because more people are paying taxes.
543
Suddenly, Cape Town is fantastic.
544
But the decision was: hey, I want to move to Africa.
545
And guess what?
546
There's a lot of people moving to Africa.
547
Taxes are a form of revenue that are net, they reduce economic activity.
548
They're a way to press the break, right?
549
And that is what transaction fees are.
550
That is what MEV is.
551
They're pressing the break on the ecosystem.
552
So let's say we, so let's go back to the exact example that, you know, I think illustrated this in my mind.
553
And why I first got in this industry, I looked at Ethereum's revenues in 2021 and I started doing DCFs and I got all excited.
554
These revenue multiples are going to go crazy, right?
555
And you could look at the same chart today with Solana's REV from late December of this year.
556
And it's, wow, if you just model these things out, look at some growth rates, this is going to be fantastic going forward.
557
But what did that do?
558
It actually constrained the network, at least on Ethereum in 2021, because the fees were way too high.
559
Now, Solana has certainly solved a lot of those challenges, which is super exciting.
560
But if the fees go up commensurate with network activity, it constrains network activity.
561
That's not what I'm saying, though.
562
The fees on Solana, actually, the median fee paid on Solana is not higher than it was in 2021, right?
563
Because Solana is doing something Ethereum never did, which is scale capacity.
564
And so as long as what you have, this is the classic Oracle versus Salesforce or AWS argument that you would much rather sell small transaction values to a significantly larger market.
565
And so my argument is not that you have.
566
What we will see is a massive scaling of capacity, which then leads to higher REV than we have today without necessitating an increase in fees.
567
I actually, sorry, just to be very clear, I don't think fees should go up.
568
I think fees on Solana are probably a little too high right now compared to what they really should be.
569
But we have 100x capacity available to scale the software package.
570
So I do want to ask one question, which is, do you also feel like REV is high on Solana now because so much more of the transactions come from meme coin traders than on Ethereum?
571
Meaning retail is like more subject to paying this than an institution.
572
So isn't that a reflection just of kind of like the user base and sort of that maturity issue that I was talking about?
573
I think it's a reflection of economic opportunity.
574
Right?
575
So the reason people are willing to pay high fees on meme coins is because they believe, rightly or wrongly, usually wrongly, that they're going to make generational wealth on a specific trade, right?
576
But if you really think like that.
577
Right.
578
So there's like a lack of sophistication or like an insensitivity to price because it's not, it's more like a, you know, for lack of a better term, more of a gambling type of situation than some kind of like more strategic, you know, here we are, this big institution, we've done like all kinds of math.
579
We've analyzed all kinds of things and like we're doing these bigger trades that are more efficient.
580
Like, am I wrong?
581
I think you see the exact same dynamic on Ethereum with FrontTech.
582
Like, this is not like a Solana thing, right?
583
Right, but what I'm saying is, like, as a percentage of all activity, that's a greater percentage on Solana.
584
So that's why Solana has higher REV than Ethereum does now.
585
That's what I'm saying.
586
No, I would say the reason Ethereum has low REV is that they intentionally offloaded execution to the L2s.
587
There's no way they should bring back on to the L1s.
588
Yeah, 100%.
589
Right.
590
So, for example, if all of the base meme coins, Zara, whatever they're promoting nowadays stuff was happening on the Ethereum L1, there would be more fees on the Ethereum L1, and we'd probably be back to the Apecoin-level airdrop fees, which were not good, but that's because Ethereum has not scaled, right?
591
So I think.
592
But isn't that the same argument that I'm making?
593
That, again, a greater percentage of the activity on Solana comes from retail than on Ethereum.
594
It's basically the same thing I'm saying.
595
Oh, yes.
596
I would say that retail has been forced off of the Ethereum mainnet.
597
Yes, definitely.
598
Okay.
599
But so this goes back to my question of over time, you still feel like Solana would want to maximize that, even though, like, for instance, Hosep sent this question and he said, one way to think of REV is that this is a lower bound on the value provided by the blockchain.
600
But if we want to measure user surplus, REV is more like the blockchain surplus, or in other words, a measure of user pain.
601
And so then he felt like REV is more like a measure of the unhealthiness of a blockchain rather than its health.
602
But I think this is like a very, very like, I hate to use this term, but I can't think of it, but it's like a very ivory tower way to look at one of these systems.
603
Because it's not like there's alternative access channels that retail has for these types of things, right?
604
Like, if you look at Robin Hood, right, or you look at credit card fees, transaction fees, and you think of these as predatory, right?
605
There's a world in which you can say that those are quote-unquote predatory compared to what you may be able to access through alternative ways of buying equities or options fees or something along those lines.
606
But the thing about Solana is that the institutional users and the retail users are on the same chain, right?
607
They're in the same market with one another.
608
And that does create differences in access and differences in ability to transact, right?
609
All these different types of things.
610
But it captures everything on that one layer.
611
And so I don't think this means fees are going to go down.
612
If this were the case, then the sequencer fees on base should be functionally zero.
613
So how much does it cost to create block space today?
614
Effectively too much.
615
Yeah, I would say effectively zero, right?
616
I mean, you can, how many chains are there out there right now?
617
L ones.
618
Apto, SUI, you know, literally, you can name 50, 60, whatever.
619
So block space is already effectively zero, and it's a competition on user growth and adoption.
620
And you don't get user growth and adoption by charging high fees.
621
It's state contention.
622
That is what people pay for.
623
The reason it is so cheap and so, you can create new block space.
624
Anyone, like S3 has tons of block space, right?
625
Block space is fine.
626
The thing is state contention.
627
And state contention is the thing people are always willing to pay for, whether in charge of the control.
628
What would you call state contention?
629
Is that security?
630
When two people want to do the same thing at the same time, one of them will pay more to go first.
631
That right contention, right?
632
When you have an NFT meant it is sequential and there are a fixed number of them, when you have an arbitrage opportunity, if it's a $10,000 arbitrage, there's always someone willing to pay $9,990 to make sure they get it, right?
633
This is like the whole thesis of HFT as well, is that mass volume, small margins.
634
And so you can have these things coexisting in the same place because there's competition for state does not box out other things, right?
635
You can have your Apecoin airdrop moment where gas goes to $3,300, but if you have a parallelized network like Solana, that spike in fees is limited to just that state that the fees spike in, and you can have USTC transfers continue to go through for fractions of a penny.
636
And that is how you see REV increase on these chains without the median fee increasing in these systems, is that you have good old-fashioned capitalism fighting it out for economic opportunity, and everyone else can keep doing their thing at the same time.
637
Agreed.
638
So I think there will be some level of fees close enough to zero, is what I'm saying.
639
Now, taking it to the logical extreme that I said before, doing out all of the numbers in terms of like looking at all equity transaction volumes more broadly, all transaction volumes on credit cards, we still get to a number that makes no sense for the current level of multiple that even just Solana is at.
640
So I just struggle to see, like, if you believe that these networks are so amazing and enormous that they're going to net 10x world GDP and transactions and bring on board the third world, like totally amazing.
641
But just doing it, even on 100% of the world's transaction volume today, you don't even get close to the numbers that you need.
642
I mean, I'm not arguing that, though.
643
So, what are we arguing here?
644
That fees are going to go to zero and REV is a useless metric.
645
I don't think REV is a useless metric.
646
I also don't think it's the only thing you should value a network on, of course, right?
647
But look, if all I tell you about a country is you can be born in a high GDP country or a low GDP country, which one would you pick?
648
The quality of life in a high GDP country, you could be in an authoritarian country that's quite wealthy, like Singapore.
649
You could be in the United States, right?
650
There's a huge amount of differences between those.
651
But generally speaking, you want to be in the place where there's more economic activity.
652
But yeah, I guess like this goes back to our earlier point about how a lot of the activities that kind of are trying to accomplish the same thing of like paying more for some kind of advantage that they're not necessarily being captured on the chain, but they are happening.
653
It's not like this one metric, because of the way it's defined, it's not capturing all the activities in the same realm on Ethereum.
654
But I just wanted to ask Tom about, you know, you talked about the base roll-ups for Ethereum as like being something that you feel like will help bring more economic activity back to the chain.
655
So do you feel like it would be better if those had centralized or decentralized sequencers?
656
And I just, for context, I just want to point out, you know, Jesse from Pollock, sorry, Jesse Pollock from base tweeted, since base launched 18 months ago, swappers have lost zero dollars to sandwich attacks.
657
And, you know, obviously, the timing of his tweet was in the context of this whole discussion.
658
So.
659
Yeah.
660
So I think like all, I think they'll start off centralized, but need to move to decentralized, because the reality is, I think, for base roll-ups, you're going to have to have some level of involvement from the L2s that exist today, which have centralized sequencers.
661
But the end goal should be decentralization, or I'm not sure we're doing it, right?
662
Like centralized servers will always be faster and cheaper than we are today.
663
Always.
664
It's decentralization, it's censorship resistance.
665
That's the whole reasons blockchain, the whole reason blockchains exist.
666
So having those be centralized as a major portion of the biggest network on blockchains doesn't make sense to me.
667
It's also just not true.
668
Like, how are they protecting against blind sandwiching?
669
Wait, I'm sorry.
670
You're saying that on base, you think people are doing what?
671
There's absolutely sandwiching going on on base.
672
And that they're not protecting against it?
673
Yeah, because it's extremely hard to protect against blind sandwiching.
674
And so just define blind sandwiching?
675
So, you know, your typical attack structure is bad transaction, user transaction, bad transaction.
676
You can space these things apart with a bunch of things in between, and it's much harder to identify.
677
But in the case of somebody who's transacting on base, they're doing it without knowing about the middle transaction?
678
Is that yeah?
679
So if you control the RPC that someone's going through here, you can still choose the ordering that you send transactions in on.
680
You can still create price movements, all sorts of these things, right?
681
Can still happen.
682
It isn't necessarily determined on just simply, you know, like a sandwich attack, if it is explicit, you know, is very easy to detect.
683
It is much harder to detect these types of things if there is some amount of spacing between the various sandwich attacks that are being run on these things.
684
So look, when you run a centralized sequencer, yes, you have a lot more control over what goes into the block, but it also doesn't mean that you're perfect, right?
685
Just because someone's in charge of a thing doesn't mean they have perfect observability over infinite time horizons.
686
As far as I know, base has not put out any data or information on how they actually enforce this to back up these claims.
687
I'd love to see it if that is out there.
688
Okay, interesting.
689
One other question I had for you was: there's this proposal by Anza to create a consensus change, Alpenglow, on Solana.
690
How do you think REV would change if Solana goes forward with that?
691
I think part of the goal of Alpenglow is to make things like parasitic mev harder to do.
692
This is part of this whole system with like relays where the whole data package is not actually reconstructable until execution.
693
And so there would be some effect of decreasing sandwiches and other types of parasitic mev because of that.
694
I think that is definitely the case.
695
The best data we can see is that it's.
696
So it may have a small decrease, but certainly not going to zero or effectively zero.
697
Okay.
698
So basically trying to make things more efficient while not necessarily taking away from what you were talking about in terms of like the value of MAV activities being captured on Solana.
699
Yeah, I think there's this like, there's this fundamental, I think the point of maybe contention or disagreement or misunderstanding in this conversation revolves around how scale impacts REV.
700
Right?
701
Is that like, you know, if I 100x a chain's capacity and I drop the fees down by 10x, I have still 10x fees.
702
Right?
703
And that's kind of what I mean by like, I don't think, I think in a vacuum where you look at block space as a fixed supply and you look at the scalability of a network as a fixed unit, like, yes, you could look at a system and say, like, okay, fees have to keep, you know, decreasing or something along those lines.
704
But you can actually build systems nowadays for users where their average fee, the median fee paid on chain, goes down and the aggregate fees to the network do continue to go up, in part because you have a mix of high-value transactions.
705
You look at like, like, Dan Smith from Blockworks had a really good tweet a few weeks ago about this, where he was looking at like the fees paid in a base block.
706
And 65% of the fees were, I think, the first like 10 transactions in a base block.
707
And so you can have this dynamic where you have a mix of high economic value, high opportunity.
708
And then the end of the block is just a numbers game.
709
It's charge every user $2 per month for the app subscription, and suddenly you have a huge amount of revenue that comes in on these things.
710
So I'm somewhat sympathetic to that argument.
711
In terms of like, okay, I said, what would happen if we did all of the transaction volume today in the world?
712
I think the argument from Washington is we could grow that volume with more new and efficient systems.
713
Certainly sympathetic to that.
714
I don't think anywhere in the near term that is realistic, right?
715
If we have 10,000, 100,000 TPS per second, is it realistic to think that that demand will be there every second going forward, or even some meaningful portion of seconds?
716
And my contention is no, because if there was that demand, we would have much more transaction volume than I quoted earlier on credit cards, on equities, on whatever you want to, whatever you want to say, right?
717
Like the volume is not there yet.
718
So if we onboard the 30 to 40% of the world that's unbanked today through crypto, 100% could have the transaction volumes we're talking about.
719
Then we'd have to assign, okay, what portion goes to Solana, Ethereum, maybe it all goes to one, whatever.
720
There's some world there where you could probably get to those numbers.
721
I don't think those numbers are very realistic to have in any meaningful timeframe that you could discount to some level of revenue or cash flow analysis.
722
Yeah, I guess I'm not like that's a fair position.
723
I don't think I've made that argument or making that argument.
724
I just don't think REV is going to zero.
725
The question is more: not is it going to zero?
726
It's more: is this one of the most important metrics by which to value blockchains?
727
I think it's hard to argue that assets secured by the L1 is a better metric for the future financial performance of an asset than REV.
728
Okay, but here's one thing that just is kind of a little bit weird to me in this whole conversation.
729
So, a number of people, including Matt Wong of Paradigm, who is saying he thinks it's important to maximize REV, a number of these people, or just like anybody, say that REV doesn't apply to Bitcoin.
730
So, what do you guys think of that?
731
Do you agree?
732
And why or why not?
733
Like, there are people saying this is so important, and then they're like, but it doesn't apply to the most important crypto asset.
734
I think Bitcoin's like always been in a lane of its own.
735
Like, I'm kind of curious to see what happens if some of the programmability layers on Bitcoin actually come to fruition.
736
Are we going to see suddenly DeFi quote-unquote on Bitcoin in some way?
737
You know, who knows, right?
738
I think it's very hard to predict.
739
I don't, like, I think REV does apply to Bitcoin, right?
740
I think if Bitcoin had more REV, it would be more valuable.
741
I don't think that means the lack of REV does not mean Bitcoin is not valuable, though, right?
742
So, like, it can be an important, like, this is like any metric that you rely on as your sole metric for a decision-making point is very flawed, right?
743
All models are wrong, some models are useful.
744
It's entirely possible that when you're looking at Bitcoin, we can say, look, zero REV.
745
Does that mean it's a useless asset?
746
No.
747
Does that mean that if it had REV, it would maybe be valued more than it is today?
748
Potentially.
749
How much is that?
750
So, you are saying you still think it's important, but just not for Bitcoin.
751
Is that kind of like the short way to argue that?
752
No, I wouldn't say it's not important for Bitcoin.
753
I'd say it doesn't exist on Bitcoin, right?
754
These are like two different things.
755
Like, how much does Bitcoin, quote-unquote, secure on top of it?
756
Right?
757
To go back to Tom's preferred metric, there's nothing deployed on top of Bitcoin.
758
It doesn't secure anything.
759
It secures Bitcoin.
760
Sure, right?
761
But that's like a tautology.
762
Yeah.
763
Yeah.
764
So, Bitcoin, as usual, is the special, and I've always thought of this and somebody described it as like if there's Bitcoin, then there's the rest of crypto.
765
Like, I just think it's so different, right?
766
It was first, it's digital gold, it's marketed that way, it's bought that way, it's you know, secured that way, it's very different.
767
So, I don't think Bitcoin L2s are enormously useful because there's inherent social consensus advantage problems that are going to happen there to actually get those advanced.
768
And I don't think that's what the network is built for.
769
People want to buy and hold Bitcoin to have more Bitcoin because it's the thing.
770
It's like, why do I buy and hold more gold?
771
It's because I have this thing gold.
772
That's it.
773
And so, I think REV is effectively useless there.
774
I don't think it makes the same sense.
775
Okay, so we're already past an hour, but I just want to talk about like just let's talk about other metrics for a moment.
776
So, this is a question by Haseib.
777
If REV becomes the dominant metric that everyone decides to value blockchains on, as we used to do with TVL, then how can it be gamed?
778
What are the degenerate cases for REV?
779
Yeah, I mean, there's tons, right?
780
GDP can be gamed as well, right?
781
Like, if I give you 20 bucks, you give me 20 bucks back, that's $40 of GDP, right?
782
You can, so like all metrics are gameable, right?
783
As we saw in the last in the last cycle, TVL stacking became like a huge problem on like both Ethereum and Solana, and like DeFi Llama actually changed how they count as a result of gaming of that, of that metric.
784
Um, I think REV is absolutely gonna be susceptible to the same things.
785
Um, the difference with it is if the if the fee paid involves burning of an asset, I it's much harder to game it, right?
786
So, for example, like base fees on Solana, 50% are burned, 50% are not.
787
It's very hard to game that without losing money.
788
Um, that's not necessarily, you know, with Jito, there's a take rate on the tips, but it's only about 2.5% or so.
789
So, there are some costs to doing this.
790
Priority fees on Solana, weirdly, there's actually no burn on those, and the validator receives 100% of it.
791
So, that is something that certainly could be gamed from that perspective.
792
So, I think it's like the quick way to do this is if you look at REV that has some sort of fee attached to it, the gaming becomes at least expensive.
793
Doesn't mean, I mean, look, the Shanghai attacks took place on Ethereum where people just paid for block space and effectively DDoSed the network.
794
Like, that wasn't economically optimal.
795
The question is: how much is a potential person trying to fake metrics willing to pay to fake those metrics?
796
Tom, what do you think?
797
How can REV be gamed?
798
I would say, since I believe fees are going to zero, I think I've made that very clear.
799
I think the MEV avenue, I would say it's effectively, if you're using it as a metric today, it's already been gamed.
800
So, if you look at Solana Q4 of this year and you use that to project forward what REV would be going forward, that would be gaming, right?
801
If you are launching all of these.
802
Or January.
803
Launching, treating, washing meme coins.
804
Yes.
805
So, 60, roughly 60 to 70%, or it's around 60 most days of Solana volume based on the Blockworks dashboard I'm looking at right now is meme coins.
806
So, if you believe that meme coins are an avenue through that, you could very easily say that it's already being gamed today.
807
Why are meme coins not legitimate?
808
So, I think, I guess I'm in somewhat of a minority here.
809
I think they're actually really effective actors to stress test the network, particularly on Solana, to show it can do a huge amount of economic activity.
810
So, I don't think they're completely meaningless, but if you're using them inherently as a long-term sustainable metric, I feel like they're inherently as useful as NFTs were.
811
I think when something happens on Solana, it's usually seen as short-term and gameable and something that's not to be taken as seriously.
812
And then, when it happens on an Ethereum chain, it's like the next great wave.
813
I mean, like, I don't know if Friend Tech had any greater staying power.
814
I mean, meme coins have probably performed just as poorly.
815
Or you go back to all of the DeFi protocols that were launched in 2020 that went to zero or just got hacked.
816
So, I don't know.
817
Like, is it going, are meme coins going to be a part of every like the majority of everything forever?
818
No, the same way NFTs are, but NFTs aren't like completely gone either.
819
The same way DeFi is not completely gone either.
820
Yeah, I don't know.
821
Like, yeah, I think there's certain advantages that I probably should have disclosed in minute one of this episode that actually holds slightly more Solana than Ethereum, which you wouldn't probably think from a lot of my comments here.
822
That's why you don't think Ethereum is going to go up from staking.
823
Slightly more, very, very slightly more.
824
But I think both networks have inherent advantages.
825
And I think the arguments are that for a lot of these, or PVP, when I think we're going to grow a whole lot from here as a community, 10, 50, 100x, whatever it is, and there's going to be a lot of winners.
826
And I think these were probably going to be the two biggest.
827
But it should be about growing the aggregate pie, and you do that through lower fees and more useful applications.
828
Importantly, in this discussion, I didn't hit on as well that I think L1 fees should go to zero or close to zero to incentivize broader user activity.
829
But application layer revenue and metrics is immensely important.
830
I think we should be valuing these things more like companies than we should be for the L1 layer.
831
So like great hyperliquid and others that are making a ton of money, like super impressive, like more power to you.
832
We need more of those.
833
So at that level, I think that's where we should actually be looking at cash flows and revenue.
834
Okay.
835
Well, so if you don't believe REV is the best metric for valuing a blockchain, then what do you think are some of the better metrics?
836
Or whatever.
837
And hopefully that's what this discussion has brought out: we need to have a more blended metric of what these things are, which is some GDP kind of aggregate scoring plus some level of other things, right?
838
Add-on models of monetary premium, other things that folks have railed against that I think are somewhat useful.
839
They need to be sort of add-on models because these aren't just equities.
840
They're not just commodities.
841
They're not just assets.
842
They're sort of all three.
843
And they're not just networks, right?
844
They're sort of like all three or four.
845
So they need to be sort of add-on models of what you think each one of those pieces are, which is using one simple metric that, again, I think is going to be very low, lower.
846
If you follow this metric, I think it's going to be much lower in the future.
847
You're going to be very disappointed.
848
Well, I think the value in these chains is growing.
849
So we have to come up with new metrics to actually effectively do that.
850
I don't think we've been there yet.
851
And Austin, what other metrics do you think are important?
852
Yeah, I mean, I guess there's just a few things I think are worth kind of like responding to directly, which is like Solana has lower fees and higher rev.
853
Like you can have your cake and eat it too to some extent with some of these types of systems where you can decrease user fees and you can increase chain revenue.
854
Solana also over the last seven days, I think it's 53% of app revenue as well.
855
The app revenue is actually higher than the rev on Solana.
856
And so like things are very much trending, I think, in the right direction when we look at this stuff.
857
I also think it's hard to look at hyperliquid and say all that REV is bad.
858
It's clearly very helpful for Hyperliquid to have the second highest REV in the industry at the moment.
859
And so if we look at what metrics really matter, the outcome you are looking to determine determines what you measure and what you care about, right?
860
If you're trying to assess what chain is going to have the broadest base of user adoption, you look at one type of metric.
861
If you're trying to look at what asset may perform best over a certain financial time horizon, you look at a different kind of metric.
862
And so, like, what metrics are we missing here when we look at this stuff?
863
I mean, I really do think we need some metric around how isolated can fees be from users, right?
864
Like, when a chain gets congested due to a Trump airdrop or an Apecoin airdrop or something like that, like, will that impact other businesses building on it?
865
Will the fees to trade the biddle fund go to $500 if there's a big airdrop?
866
Well, that's suddenly, that's like extremely business hostile, right?
867
It's extremely hostile to trying to get like Visa or a MasterCard to build something on a blockchain if fees can't be at least fairly predictable for them over that time period.
868
I haven't seen a good quantification of like almost some type of installation metric.
869
I think that would be really interesting to see as well into the future.
870
But I really like stablecoins deploying, right?
871
Stablecoin volume and stablecoin deployment.
872
I think right now, if I have to hang my hat on one important metric, and if I'm only allowed to pick one metric, that might be it.
873
Interesting.
874
Okay, okay.
875
Well, any last thoughts that either of you didn't get to say during the episode that you want to mention?
876
I think Austin and I agree on a lot of things directionally.
877
I think we're both in the space because we think it's going to grow a lot, and we just want to better understand the metrics that folks should be looking at when making these investment decisions.
878
My vocal support is for folks to dig deeper.
879
And I think we're right now still at the surface level understanding of where these things are.
880
And as we get more data points, and that's naturally just been a problem: we don't have a lot of data points, and most of them have been pretty noisy and short sample size and all that.
881
But as we get more data, we should be more diligent in trying to actively back into these things and how to effectively sell them to bigger participants who are going to come into the space.
882
Yeah, I think the only thing, I totally agree that we're mostly aligned on a bunch of stuff.
883
We just differ on where we think fees are going over the long term.
884
I would also say, as we get into a little bit more bully, a little bit more frothy market, the signal-to-noise ratio goes almost incomprehensible pretty quickly in this industry.
885
And so I would almost say that positive metrics are not worth looking at anymore.
886
If you really want to figure out how something is going to do or where it's going, look out for metrics you would consider to be like five alarm fires and track those.
887
Because the positive ones get gamed, but no one ever games the negative metrics.
888
Okay, that's a good point.
889
Although I think some of us differ on whether RAV is a positive or negative metric.
890
But anyway, okay, well, where can people learn about each of you and your work?
891
Dunley V89 on Twitter, and lots of thoughts and analysis there.
892
Barries.capital for.xyz is the project me and my co-founders are working on, which is a physical fiber infrastructure network for high-performance distributed systems.
893
Perfect.
894
It's been a pleasure having you both on Unchained.
