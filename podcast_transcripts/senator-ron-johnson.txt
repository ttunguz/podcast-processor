1
Power corrupts.
2
Government is power, and it's been corrupt.
3
Nobody knew in total how much we spend because we never even talk about it.
4
The first goal of this Republican budget reconciliation should be don't add to the deficit.
5
I voted for President Trump because I wanted him to defeat the deep state.
6
You don't defeat the deep state by continuing to fund it at Biden's levels.
7
Our base is going to go, why did we elect you guys?
8
You're really no better than Democrats.
9
I don't think President Trump, he's not focused on reducing spending.
10
This is our one opportunity.
11
And right now we're blowing it.
12
And I'm going to do everything I can to make sure we don't blow it.
13
I can't be pressured by President Trump.
14
He's willing to sit down with me, look at the numbers, acknowledge them, working for it in a reasonable plan forward.
15
That's the only way he's going to get my support.
16
So everyone has assumed that the House passage of the reconciliation bill is going to go to the Senate with some minor changes and then make its way to President Trump's desk for signing.
17
But that may not be the case.
18
There are several hardliners in the U.S.
19
Senate who have made it very clear that the budget and the fiscal deficit problems that arise from this bill are insurmountable and they're going to take a very hard stance on voting no on this bill.
20
Taking the lead on that point of view is Senator Johnson from Wisconsin, who's going to join us today for an emergency pod to talk about what's next with the Senate review of the reconciliation bill, what his thoughts are, what's the future of the Republic, and what's ahead.
21
We're really excited for this emergency pod.
22
Thank you for joining us.
23
I'm going all in.
24
All right, besties.
25
I think that was another epic of discussion.
26
People want the interviews.
27
I can't hear talk for hours.
28
Absolutely.
29
We crush your questions in a minute.
30
We are giving people rounds data under your honesty.
31
What are you going to say?
32
That was fun.
33
I'm going all in.
34
Senator, thanks for joining Chamothan for this conversation this morning.
35
Good morning, guys, and thanks for having me on.
36
And just by way of background, Senator, you were elected to the U.S.
37
Senate in 2010.
38
More recently, we've taken notice, and I gave a shout-out to you for your comments on the scaling of the deficit and the U.S.
39
federal debt.
40
And as a Republican, against the stated intention of getting this bill passed and through the Senate as is, and we'd love to kind of hear from you today about your points of view on the bill that was passed in the House this week, the Reconciliation Bill, and then take a step back and talk a little bit about the fiscal picture for the United States and where things are headed.
41
So thanks for that, and thanks for joining us.
42
Maybe we could just start a little bit with a very basic primer for our audience, something that we don't talk about very much on the show.
43
Can you just tell us what a reconciliation bill is and how it's used so folks can understand a little bit about the process that the House just undertook and what's ahead?
44
Sure.
45
Let me start.
46
You talked about when I first ran for election in 2010, I sprang out of the Tea Party, never been involved in politics whatsoever, and didn't even decide to run until the end of April, announced in May, started a campaign during the summer, did all those parades.
47
What I would shout during the parades was: this is a fight for freedom.
48
We're mortgaging our children's future.
49
It's wrong.
50
It's immoral.
51
It has to stop.
52
That was my campaign theme in 2010.
53
I still view myself more Tea Party than the Republican Party.
54
We have a lot of big spenders of the Republican Party as well.
55
And I ran, again, because of Obamacare, which I knew would not work.
56
And it's not working.
57
That's, by the way, that's the problem with Medicaid right now: Obamacare is now called Medicaid expansion.
58
But to answer your question, budget reconciliation was set up in the Budget Act, I think it was 1974.
59
It doesn't work in terms.
60
We'll get into that in terms of we've never had a process for actually controlling spending, but it allows us to pass a budget and then to reconcile the budget.
61
You're able to, and you can pass a budget, it's not a law, but you pass this budget with just 50 votes, 51 votes, majority.
62
And then you can reconcile to that budget, also avoiding the Senate filibuster.
63
So that's the main component.
64
What's weird about it is you pass this budget, but you can only, through budget reconciliation, address mandatory spending.
65
You can't touch the discretionary spending accounts, which is about 25% of our budget.
66
That's one of the ways the budget has gotten completely out of control is we put so many things into the mandatory category.
67
Initially it was entitlement, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, but we have, I would say, deviously slid all kinds of discretionary spending into other mandatory that really exploded during COVID, where I think other mandatory hit well over $2 trillion.
68
Last fiscal year was about $1.3 trillion.
69
This year it'll be over a trillion.
70
So it went from $642 billion in 2019, other mandatory, again, not Social Security, Medicare, or even Medicaid.
71
Went from $642 to last year, $1.3.
72
This year is going to be over a trillion dollars, and it's going to keep pretty much at that level as far as the eye can see.
73
So again, that's a trillion dollars of other non-entitlement spending that we never looked at.
74
And that's the whole point about mandatory spending.
75
It's never looked at.
76
So anyway, so we can address mandatory spending, not Social Security, through this reconciliation process, change programs, do whatever we want to do as long as it has a primarily budgetary impact, not changing policy.
77
So, you can change policy as long as it has a budgetary impact.
78
I know that's reasonably complex, but it's an insane system and it doesn't work.
79
What is the alternative?
80
Well, right now we don't really have one.
81
Again, let's just go through why we've never had a process to control spending.
82
We don't have a balanced budget requirement like the states do, and we have the capability of printing money, which we're doing, incurring this enormous debt.
83
So, we don't have a balanced budget requirement.
84
I didn't realize this until just recently.
85
The appropriation committees were literally set up because the authorized committees were big spenders.
86
So, they set up appropriation committees to control spending.
87
That didn't work.
88
The Budget Act didn't work.
89
Simpson Bowles didn't work.
90
The Budget Control Act didn't work.
91
It did restrain discretionary spending for a couple of years until we weaseled our way around it.
92
So, again, we've never had a process to control spending.
93
And one of the things I've been arguing in some Wall Street Journal columns is: let's use the example of Doge.
94
I come with the private sector.
95
We probably spent more time reviewing my line-by-line budget for my business.
96
And I think other private sector businesses spend more time analyzing what they're going to spend than Congress spends over the entire federal budget.
97
So, we've got to develop a process.
98
Doge has shown us how to do it, go contract by contract, expose the grotesque waste, fraud, and abuse.
99
But we've got to do that through thousands of lines through the federal budget, but nobody's willing to do it.
100
Nobody's willing to take the time to do the work to do it.
101
They try and tweak them, try and get a big score out of CBO so they can say, hey, look, we saved $1.5 trillion, and yet that's completely divorced from reality.
102
$1.5 trillion sounds like a lot, but over 10 years it's $150 billion against a $7,000 billion dollar year budget that only six years ago was $4,400 billion.
103
And if I've got one complaint in terms of the process in the House, it's basically a void of reality.
104
We're not talking about the numbers we should be talking about, which is a 10-year deficit projected by CBO of $22 trillion, averaging $2.2 trillion a year.
105
We don't talk about, say, we folks are on $1.5 trillion, and then they're patting themselves on the back that they didn't even achieve $1.5 trillion.
106
I just want to make sure, Senator, then, that we're on the same page with respect to the math.
107
If this bill passes as is, can the general public take the 33 or 34 odd trillion that we have in debt?
108
Should we add 22 trillion and say we'll be at 58 trillion by 2035?
109
Is that the right math or the wrong math?
110
That understates it.
111
Now, they'll talk about dynamic scoring, and I believe in dynamic scoring as well.
112
But in this case, if you take a look at the tax cuts that President Trump is proposing, they're not going to generate growth.
113
They're just going to reduce the deficit.
114
The CBO projection I'm looking at assumes we're going to gain another $4 trillion from increasing taxes.
115
So, again, we may not get that $4 trillion, but no matter what, the CBO projection right now that is adding another $22 trillion to our debt, it certainly would add.
116
And the CBO scores assume the interest rate on the federal debt, I believe, is an average of 3.6%.
117
And now we're seeing the 30-year trading above 5%, meaning that if we trade up to 5% for the cost of debt for the federal government, we're probably going to add another $5 trillion of incremental interest expense over the period, another half trillion a year on average over the next 10 years.
118
And I would agree the current CBO projection, that's what I'm talking about here, you know, going from $37 to $59 trillion in debt is a rosy, you know, the rosy scenario.
119
That's as good as we're going to do.
120
So this does not mean the moment in terms of what we have to do.
121
Senator, let me just ask, I think one point of clarification on your earlier comment, which I think would be important for the audience.
122
What has been put under mandatory that should be discretionary?
123
It covers the entire gamut of federal spending.
124
Education, welfare, food stamps, veterans' benefits.
125
Again, they've just transferred that into mandatory spending.
126
So it's completely out of sight, out of mind, and unaccountable.
127
When it sits in discretionary, maybe just help folks understand what does it mean if it sits in discretionary?
128
Does that mean that then the administration under the president has the authority to spend up to that amount to administer the law, to administer the statutes, but doesn't necessarily have to?
129
And the mandatory demands that the capital goes out, just help us understand for the audience what the difference is.
130
Well, discretionary is actually supposedly passed.
131
We generally, at best, which is awful, minibuses or omnibuses.
132
These are these multi-thousand-page bills that get dropped on our desks and we have to vote on them literally within 24 to 48 hours.
133
Nobody reads them, nobody knows what's in them.
134
That process is pretty broken down.
135
Right now, we are operating for this fiscal year under a continuing resolution, which tweaks a few things, but is basically spending at last year's levels on all those appropriated accounts.
136
So, again, that's about 25% of our budget.
137
Then, 75% is in the mandatory accounts, the entitlements, and just other mandatory spending.
138
So, the arithmetic indicates we're entering into a debt-debt spiral in the United States with the interest rates climbing, the deficit climbing, and we then need to spend more money to pay our interest on the existing debt.
139
That increases the deficit.
140
We need to borrow more.
141
The debt spirals up, interest rates climb, and this becomes an insurmountable hill to climb.
142
As you have the conversation with members of the Republican Party, what's the point of view?
143
What is the motivating factor for business as usual?
144
Why is it so difficult to get folks to see the basic arithmetic in front of them?
145
Well, let me give you an example from about three years ago.
146
This is after COVID, and on a bipartisan basis, we're in a massive spending spree in 2020, but then the Biden administration discontinued that.
147
So, we were in omnibus spending debate.
148
And for the first time, even though the Republican Senate conference, we have a resolution against earmarks, McConnell.
149
So I asked my colleagues at that time, I said, hey, anybody know how much in total we spent last year in the federal government?
150
Room was dead silent.
151
I went out to Washington Press Sport, asked the same question.
152
I mean, hey, anybody know how much we spent last year?
153
And one reporter said it was over a trillion dollars.
154
No, that's just discretionary spending.
155
The answer was something like $6.3 trillion because we had gone from $4.4 trillion in 2019 up to $6.5 trillion, and we've never looked back.
156
And the analogy I used to is: no family, if they had an illness, borrowed $50,000, pay medical bills, if they got well the next year, they wouldn't keep borrowing $50,000 to spend that level, but that's exactly what we've done.
157
But the point of my story was: nobody knew in total how much we spend because we never even talk about it.
158
Never even talked about it.
159
So that's out of sight, out of mind.
160
So it's completely out of control.
161
I mean, I am the guys, you know, starting with my Wall Street Journal column of January 1st about returning to a pre-pandemic global spending.
162
I mean, I've been hammering the Senate Republican conference on a weekly basis and just, you know, ad nauseam, quite honestly.
163
But what's the pushback?
164
What do they say?
165
They've thrown the towel.
166
They go, well, it's too hard.
167
I mean, that's unrealistic.
168
You just can't do it.
169
Even though I lay out, so let me just tell you how I laid out my pre-pandemic levels of spending.
170
This is between Christmas and New Year's.
171
I'm trying to figure out how can I communicate this?
172
How can I justify this?
173
What kind of control can we put on things?
174
So I literally went back in history.
175
I went back to Clinton in 1998, Obama in 2014, and Trump in 2019.
176
And I exempted Social Security, Medicare, and Intercontinental.
177
But all other actual outlays in those three years, I increase them by inflation and population.
178
You know, reasonable control, right?
179
It's what we should have.
180
We don't have a balanced budget.
181
amendment.
182
At least we should have some reasonable control over outlays.
183
Population growth, inflation would make sense.
184
Senator, if we take your math and say that we are headed to, let's take the midpoint, $65 trillion of debt by 2035, I think it's fair to say that the bond market will have a negative reaction to that.
185
And what Dave just talked about, which is a 5% borrowing rate for America, could be on the low side.
186
And that's the spiral that he's talking about.
187
On Friday, Secretary Besson tried to get in front of this, and his commentary was: we will grow our way out.
188
Can you talk to us about what he means by that and what the boundary conditions need to be to grow our way out?
189
First of all, by my calculation, our average interest rate over the last 50 years on government debt is about 5.8%.
190
So that's 50 years, and we're down here about three, somewhere around 3%.
191
Those are not exact calculations.
192
Listen, that is the hope of all of us.
193
I mean, I will absolutely agree that the number one component of a solution to our enormous debt-indeficent problem is economic growth.
194
We have to grow the economy.
195
But here's the problem: when the government is sucking out of the private sector, we're the ones borrowing the money, so there's not a whole lot of money left for businesses and the private sector.
196
Now, you can print more money, but then that sparks inflation.
197
And that, of course, erodes everybody's balance sheet.
198
It also makes our debt less expensive as well.
199
But because we're so in debt, that drives up the interest rates.
200
And again, it ends up being a death and debt spiral.
201
So nobody can predict this.
202
But I mean, that's just the wishful thinking of people putting forward a policy, a one big, beautiful bill that doesn't live up to its name, but actually exacerbates the problem.
203
What are the tools then in your toolbox?
204
So you get back in the next week or two and you talk to your colleagues, and now it's on your desk.
205
How do you start getting your arms around this?
206
What do you do starting on Monday or next Monday?
207
So I try to lay out the basic numbers.
208
That's what I was talking about.
209
You know, my pre-pandemic process of spending, Clinton, if you use that process, go from $1.7 to $5.5 trillion.
210
That's how you plus up there.
211
That's been Obama would be $6.2 trillion, Trump's 2019, 6.5.
212
So now you've got a baseline budget.
213
You've always heard these Republican members of Congress running for office saying, we're going to go to zero-based budget.
214
They're not even willing to go to 5.5 to 6.5 level baseline of budget.
215
So again, what is the process that just might work?
216
Does this kind of show it to us, you know, line by line?
217
You have to scrutinize all this.
218
It takes a lot of work.
219
It takes a lot of time.
220
And that's why I've always argued for a multiple approach here, multiple steps.
221
Provide the border funding.
222
I would just extend current tax law.
223
I mean, again, I would have voted for that if we'd have been smart enough to use current policy back then we wouldn't be even having this conversation extend current tax law takes an automatic massive tax increase off the table increase the debt ceiling enough for a year to keep pressure on the process to do the work to go line by line, expose spending.
224
I've got to believe, when you've gone from $4,400 billion to $7,000 billion worth of spending, if you start scrutinizing that line by line, there would literally be hundreds of billions of dollars that the public wouldn't even know we're not spending.
225
The only people who would know would be the grifters who are sucking down the pork.
226
So when you say the folks in the Republican Party that aren't willing to do the hard work, it's just so obvious how big of a crisis we are in and everyone's kind of being blind to it.
227
So I'm just trying to understand what is it that's keeping the blindfold on?
228
Is it that there are donors, that there are constituents?
229
I'll give you an example.
230
A couple years ago, I went in for the Farm Bill review with the Senate Ag Committee 2012, so a long time ago.
231
And we started talking about one of the agencies in the USDA, and they have 10,000 employees and said, you know, why does this make sense in a digital age?
232
And the answer was it doesn't.
233
It's like, well, why is the agency still running and employing all these people?
234
Well, because the senators don't want to lose the jobs in their state, because that's 10,000 jobs split amongst roughly seven states, and it's really important to those seven states to keep those jobs.
235
Is that the motivation that there's economic dollars flowing into the states that keeps the representatives and the senators from making the tough decisions?
236
Is it that they're getting donor dollars?
237
What's the real motivation here that's keeping everyone from tackling reality?
238
Well, again, as I pointed out, most don't even recognize the full reality.
239
I've heard it said, I didn't hear McConnell say it personally, but I've heard him say, show me a member of Congress who ever lost the election because they spent too much money.
240
So there's no public pressure not to spend.
241
People love tax cuts.
242
People love the free money.
243
We collectively as a society are whistling by the graveyard.
244
Nobody wants to say that this is unsustainable because to fix it is painful.
245
I mean, you are going to have to reduce spending.
246
And then you're very open to the political accusations as coming in.
247
We're trying to slash Medicaid for disabled children.
248
No, we're trying to preserve it for disabled children, try and get the able-bodied, childless working-age adults back to work and on private sector health care.
249
But again, that's a more difficult argument to make.
250
So it's just the way that the process just plows on.
251
We've never, as I said, there's never been a process to actually control spending.
252
So this is the way we've always done it.
253
You come up to these deadlines, you put everything into one big bill, you give people things that you have to vote for.
254
You don't want to default on the debt.
255
You don't want to increase taxes.
256
So those elements you bundle up with a bunch of crap and you twist people's arms to pay for it and keeping them basically ignorant because you never talk about the massive numbers, the massive problem that we're really in.
257
I mean, people kind of know it, but as long as the presses are reporting on it, as long as the press isn't connecting the dots, the massive deaths of spending is why you can't afford things, why your dollar you held in 2019 is only worth 80 cents versus the bucket should be.
258
By the way, a dollar you held in 1998 is worth $0.50.
259
Okay?
260
So again, we don't teach people, there's no public pressure in terms of reducing spending or reducing the deficit.
261
There's just virtually none.
262
I mean, you know, from conservatives right now, I'm getting it all the time.
263
Boy, make sure that you make no tax on tips permanent.
264
Make sure you make no tax on overtime permanent.
265
So, well, first of all, we probably shouldn't even be doing either of those.
266
By the way, I'm all for no tax on cash tips.
267
You know, we can't collect it anyway, so don't even try.
268
I'm all for that.
269
But you've got to recognize these other tax cuts, they're not going to grow the economy.
270
They're not going to focus on the one component that Besson's talking about, that we have to grow our economy.
271
I actually am very supportive of the no tax on tips, no tax on overtime.
272
The monetary cost of those things are relatively not that meaningful.
273
And so it has a broad-based positive impact with a lower cost is actually the reason why we should do it.
274
The thing that I was sort of like puzzled by, when 50 people or 60 people are constructing something, you get this bill that comes out of the house, which has the things that the president asked for, but with all of these other Christmas tree ornaments hanging from it, and it's impossible to figure out what's actually going on.
275
Well, I don't even think it's even 50 and 60 people constructing this.
276
I think it's a much smaller group of people, and then you maybe have 50 or 60 chiming in on one issue or another.
277
Let me push back on overtime with you, though.
278
I ran a plastics operation, continuous shift.
279
If you're going to have your work 24-7, you need four shifts.
280
So, part of the problem with no tax on overtime, first of all, it's no tax on some overtime.
281
So, it's going to add to the regulatory burden.
282
I wouldn't want to be the accounting clerk to have to keep track of that, but I know for computers, it's easy to do so.
283
They should be forced to go to four shifts because they burn out.
284
Pay them more.
285
But from my standpoint, having run a continuous shift operation, I think there's enough incentive paying time and a half or double time on a Sunday for people to work.
286
Income is income.
287
I don't want to segregate.
288
I don't want to socially or economically engineer through the tax code.
289
And that's just part of that economic engineering through the tax code.
290
I love the fact we're focusing on working men and women.
291
Great.
292
But I would rather simplify the tax code for them and overall lower their tax burden.
293
But again, lower the rates, brown the base.
294
But we're not doing that.
295
We lowered the rates and we made it more complex.
296
We did not simplify the tax code in 2017.
297
One of the reasons I actually wanted a two-step process was to take them to simplify and rationalize our tax code.
298
Can we talk about other things that didn't make it in that we thought were going to get in there?
299
Another way to generate revenue would have been to close the carried interest loophole.
300
I don't know if you have any points of view on that.
301
Well, I've talked to numerous people who benefit from carried interest.
302
I always ask them: can you explain to me why that's not ordinary income?
303
And they can't.
304
It is ordinary income.
305
Speaking of the ones that are pretty big into it, they do make a pretty powerful case that, you know, all these deals, all these structures, all these business arrangements are already structured that way.
306
You can eliminate that break and it's really not going to raise any revenue.
307
They make a reasonably convincing case there, too.
308
So that's kind of where we are on that.
309
Which is sort of like at an impasse.
310
Yeah, my guess is just not going to happen.
311
Right.
312
And kind of going, your overtime, it's just not that big of revenue.
313
Is it really worth messing with?
314
One of the things that Elon has been talking about recently is that we could be on the precipice of an energy deficit starting next year, where we need every form of power possible to be generating as many electrons as possible.
315
And so solar, wind, coal, nat gas, nuclear.
316
There was a bunch of provisions here that change the tax incentives.
317
What's your thoughts on all of those that may change the landscape of electron availability?
318
Well, I think it's insane that we've been shutting down coal-fired electrical generation.
319
We need a lot of it.
320
I would really focus on nuclear myself.
321
I think that is, you know, if you're concerned about climate change, and I'm not, we'll adapt.
322
But nuclear would be the thing we ought to be pushing.
323
I really don't want to subsidize energy production.
324
I don't want to subsidize anything.
325
Again, I want a simple and rational tax code.
326
So my approach would always be to simplify those things.
327
Again, I don't want to pull the rug out from under people.
328
I mean, if we've subsidized things and people made investment based on certain things, kind of respect that.
329
The comment that I made to my colleagues is FERC came out with a report.
330
It said 81% of the incremental energy that was generated in the United States were backed by some form of tax credits.
331
This is not to judge.
332
It's just meant to say that financial actors go to where the incentives are.
333
And if we change them and we take 81% of this incremental energy offline and you can't get a NAT gas turbine, you know, for example, I'm going to announce on Monday.
334
I can get nuclear from the state of Arizona, but that's not broadly available everywhere.
335
And so there's these practical investment decisions that the financial community wants to make to keep America at the forefront.
336
It's a little murkier today, unless the Senate understands these nuances and helps us, because if we can't make these investments, then we're just not going to do it.
337
I say Congress in general doesn't understand what you're talking about.
338
Again, I said I don't want to pull the rug out from 100 people.
339
I understand investment because I was in business.
340
But again, I want to move toward a more simple system.
341
And again, it's insane what government, you know, all the green new energy thing.
342
It misallocates capital.
343
Take a look at what's happening in Europe and Germany.
344
So if they're artificially driving up the cost of power, for what?
345
Okay?
346
I mean, it's a fantasy.
347
It's a self-inflicted wound.
348
We spent something like $5 or $6 trillion globally on climate change.
349
Again, whether you believe it or not, we haven't bent the needle.
350
That's just $5 or $6 trillion basically wasted.
351
So again, I recognize the fact we've waste a lot of money.
352
We've incentivized people for a certain type of power.
353
The solution would be quit doing it long term and let the marketplace provide as much energy cheap as possible.
354
Again, protect the environment.
355
I don't want pollution, but the whole climate change thing is.
356
I care about electron surplus and having an infinite supply of electrons, which is effectively the threshold issue between us and whatever form of abundance we're going to find with robots, with going to Mars, with building AGI.
357
The threshold issue is.
358
Where it comes from, I really don't care.
359
But the reality with nuclear is, you know, we can't wait till 2035 for electrons to turn on.
360
That's just a non-starter.
361
So as much as we have to pay for the sins of the past, and the sins of the past is we turned all that stuff off idiotically, to your point, because of some, you know, crying child.
362
But now we have to pay for the conditions on the ground.
363
I have a different question, which is, I want to go back to Dave's question on Doge, Senator, which is there was a $9 billion rescission bill that went to the House, and unfortunately, it didn't make a lot of progress.
364
What is the future of Doge as you see it?
365
First of all, it was beneficial for no other reason than it exposed how oblivious and ignorant Congress was of all this waste, fraud, and abuse.
366
Okay, I mean, that has value right there.
367
It should have embarrassed every member of Congress, all these department heads, that this kind of spending, this kind of crap was going on, and that they weren't doing oversight on it.
368
They weren't taking a look at it.
369
But, and I tried getting Elon's attention, quite honestly, about, you know, can give me somebody in Doge that I can work with so that as soon as you identify the spending, we can connect it to an appropriation account, we can connect it to a mandatory spending account so we can actually codify it.
370
He didn't seem to have the time, and quite honestly, in a personal conversation, he said, well, we don't have to do that.
371
Well, we do have to do that.
372
And so, you know, we've been hammering Russ's vote.
373
You know, send us a rescission package.
374
You know, finally, he bundles up $9 billion.
375
When, on, I think the last time I looked at Doge's website, they were up to 165 things higher than that now.
376
They're kind of.
377
But the fact of the matter is, it has to be codified.
378
Just putting it on the website is valuable, but we got to bank the savings.
379
And so anything that's mandatory has got to be done through reconciliation.
380
Otherwise, it's got to be done from rescission.
381
You've got to get the public support for this.
382
I don't know why they haven't done it.
383
So can you just explain that to us?
384
Like what we see on the website, is that not saved?
385
There's a question.
386
They've stopped contracts.
387
They're no longer spending money that way.
388
But the question is whether the president on his own can impound those funds.
389
So they may not be spent, but they're just going to be sitting out there as unallocated spending to be spent sometime in the future unless you rescind them.
390
And again, that's the beauty of rescission and reconciliation.
391
We don't need Democrats to help us there.
392
We can do that with simple majorities of both the House and the Senate.
393
And again, it'll be pretty depressing.
394
President Trump in his first administration sent up a $15 billion recision package and has voted down the Senate.
395
Two Republican senators vote against it.
396
And my guess is they paid no political price for doing that.
397
Any Republican that would vote against the rescission package ought to pay a pretty huge political price in voting that thing down.
398
It's going to take presidential leadership.
399
He's got to be focusing on that.
400
And I'm sorry, I don't think President Trump, he's doing all kinds of great things.
401
He's not focused on reducing spending.
402
What do you think that is?
403
Have you talked with his staff or him directly about it?
404
Was this not as apparent to him and his staff as it is to you?
405
I just think that.
406
It's going to hit his radar here this next few weeks.
407
So, again, he liked the concept, the slogan of one beautiful bill.
408
I don't think he was overly concerned or understanding what the details were.
409
I'm going to force him to take a look at the details.
410
I'm going to force the discussion on spending.
411
It feels like we're about to enter some form of papal conclave where you and your senator colleagues are going to go into a room.
412
There's either going to be white smoke or black smoke.
413
So, can you walk us through what is the mechanics now?
414
What will it be like when Senator Thune brings you together and you all caucus?
415
Or how does this work now for you?
416
So, we've been in the finance community, we've been working on these things, but again, it's all about scores, right?
417
I've got to point this out.
418
You hear these scores, right?
419
But they're divorced from, they're not tied to anything.
420
It's like, okay, I got a score of 65.
421
Well, good.
422
I mean, it's good if you're golfing.
423
It's awful if you're bowling.
424
So, you get all these scores.
425
They're divorced from reality.
426
So, again, the process is complete.
427
It's by and large a charade.
428
Okay, somebody else is going to write this thing that's going to be shoved down people's throats.
429
So, what I intend to do is I intend to open it up and bring this to the light of day.
430
I've been doing this since January 1st, writing about giving three pre-pandemic levels, three options on pre-pandemic levels of spending.
431
Next column: here's the process, a line-by-line, deep dive, forensic audit.
432
You know, I'd love to take the Doge team right now and just bring them over.
433
Let's focus on this.
434
Let's spend months doing this, but we'll need time.
435
We'll need a two-step process, you know.
436
And then, you know, literally, my last column just.
437
Did you ever hear $2.2 trillion average deficit being projected, $22 trillion, $59 trillion in debt?
438
No, but it's just $1.5 trillion.
439
Oh, like, that's a lot.
440
It's almost meaningless.
441
It's a rounding error.
442
So I'm going to force this debate.
443
That's why I'm on your show here today.
444
That's why I'm going to be doing Jake Tapper tomorrow.
445
Either way, bring the numbers to the fore.
446
Senator, is there a hard line that you'll have that if we don't get this deficit level to X, because that's the focus, that's the objective, that's the primary objective rather at this point in time in this Republic, that you'll say I'm a no vote.
447
And have you been that declarative about your position on this?
448
I've been pretty upfront.
449
The first goal of this Republican budget reconciliation should be don't add to the deficit, because that'd probably be the first goal.
450
Beyond that, what I've always said is I want a commitment to return to a reasonable pre-pandemic level of spending and a process to achieve and maintain it.
451
Again, I'm reasonably open.
452
I recognize we have to get the votes.
453
So I always say I don't have a hard number, but what I've done is I've laid out these options.
454
And right now, the hard number accepted by and expected by a lot of senators, enough to not pass this until we achieve it, is $6.5 trillion of spending in 2026.
455
And I can walk through how you get to that point, but that's kind of the number.
456
Right now, we're expected to spend about $7.3 trillion next year.
457
So that implies about $88 trillion in deficit reduction.
458
So that's a pretty big delta.
459
What scoring do you go off of?
460
Is that the CBO scoring that you would use to make that estimate?
461
Some of the conversation that we've heard is that the revenue effects of some of the new programs are not taken into account fully, that there may be revenue coming in from tariffs.
462
There may be revenue coming in from the sale of the Trump immigration card at $5 million a pop, and there's a limited effect of the tax cuts on GDP growth, et cetera.
463
So there's a lot of arguments to be made to make the line seem a little more blurry than perhaps the scoring might indicate.
464
That's why I try and simplify things.
465
Okay, I'm focusing on spending.
466
We went from 4.4 to, it'll be 7.3 next year.
467
Let's bring it down to a reasonable pre-pandemic level, 6.5.
468
Spending, spending, spending.
469
I voted for President Trump because I wanted him to defeat the deep state.
470
You don't defeat the deep state by continuing to fund it at Biden's levels.
471
So the minute you start bringing revenue, nobody can project that.
472
Nobody knows exactly what the impact is going to be.
473
So that starts muddying the waters.
474
So I focus on spending.
475
I don't really want to fund the deep state.
476
I would like to bring certainty to the economy.
477
I'd like the trade wars to end so we can bring that level of stability.
478
I don't want to increase taxes.
479
So again, my approach would be multiple step: border defense, bank the savings, take whatever good work the House did, bank that, extend current tax law, as awful and as complex as it is, just extend that, increase the debt ceiling for a year to put pressure on us to come back and do the work on the spending.
480
And then we can bring up President Trump's.
481
Do you think that there's any upside or legislative resolve to think about monetizing assets?
482
So, for example, Secretary Lutnick has talked about the vast resources, Secretary Bergam has talked about it as well, the vast resources that America has, whether it should, you know, we should consider thinking about monetizing some of those things, selling federal lands, selling drilling rights, selling royalty rights.
483
What do you think about that as an incremental way of softening the landing here?
484
I would say the only reason I'm not in a full-fledged panic is because people like Art Laffer do point out we have vast wealth.
485
I mean, so our debt, our debt to GDP ratio is probably not the most relevant, is relevant for inflation, that type of thing, but debt to total assets is probably the more relevant.
486
So we literally can afford this level of debt, but you do have to compare it to income as well and our ability to service the debt and the debt spiral.
487
So again, this all ends up being a lot of different factors coming into what's going to make it possible for people to live.
488
And again, inflation is probably the one metric that we need to avoid.
489
And I think that's the thing that I'm most concerned about in terms of debts and spending.
490
I'm not concerned about America going bankrupt because we have this vast wealth.
491
I'm concerned about us being insolvent in sparking massive inflation and just wiping out people's savings, making it very impossible for them to live and retire.
492
What do you think is the future through these next 16 months of bills and the impact?
493
To your point, there's a lot of people.
494
And if we continue to feed it, it seems like a traditionalist default.
495
We're going back to the way things were.
496
Can you talk to us about that and what your thoughts are about that?
497
Well, I'm highly concerned about just the conservative movement.
498
I think Trump is a completely unique political figure.
499
I think he definitely did drive turnout.
500
He's expanded, you know, certainly our base, which, by the way, is one of the reasons I am sympathetic to what you're talking about in terms of the tax cuts he's proposed.
501
I mean, we need to focus on the working men and women of this country.
502
It's really the Trump coalition.
503
But I'm concerned about how effective Democrats are, the coalition they have, made up of the media, primarily social media companies, that type of thing, their relentlessness of letting all these undocumented people in this country who are voting.
504
I mean, we're starting to see that type of fraud.
505
That are, you know, they are trying to cheat.
506
I think they do cheat in voting.
507
I think we don't have a real feeling in terms of how, you know, the order of magnitude of their cheating.
508
But a quick example of, you know, we had that important Supreme Court race here.
509
Elon Musk came in here, did some pretty innovative things, spent a lot of money here.
510
The liberal candidate got 78% of Kamala Harris's vote.
511
The conservative candidate got 62% of Donald Trump's vote.
512
Even though we were all out there saying how important this is, if you don't want to see President Trump impeached by a Democrat-controlled Congress in the next Congress, you got to get out and support President Trump.
513
That didn't resonate.
514
Again, 78% of Democrats came out, 62% of Republicans.0 where it starts with energy, but then there's just a gravitational pull of the establishment is just too strong for the rebels to fight up?
515
No, I think the greatest danger of MAGA is it's really tied toward one individual.
516
The Tea Party movement was tied toward the vision of America: freedom, debt and deficit, not mortgage or kids' future.
517
I think that survived.
518
I mean, they did a pretty good job of marginalizing the Tea Party, but we're alive and well.
519
We are the House Freedom Caucus.
520
We're the people that are going to stop this until we just get a much better bill in the Senate.
521
So we're still alive and well.
522
But in terms of voters, the Tea Party pretty well merged with the Republican Party.
523
I'm not sure all the MAGA voters are just discussed by the whole process, as am I.
524
And they're much more likely to sit on the couch unless their guy is on the ballot.
525
Do you think that our model of representative democracy is broken and has the same sort of inevitable outcome that others have had in the past, that ultimately people realize they can vote themselves all the money and they do, and the system breaks?
526
I mean, like, if you were to go back and be a founding father, what would you have done differently here?
527
And or am I off on this?
528
No, no, I'm not sure you are off at all.
529
No, I think we may have already passed that hinge point.
530
That's my concern.
531
I mean, people ask me, are you optimistic?
532
No, I'm a pessimist.
533
I'm looking around.
534
That is the death knell of a democracy or Republican.
535
When a majority of the voters realize, hey, I can vote myself benefits.
536
Don't worry about the debt and desiccate.
537
We can print money.
538
No, that's what brings down.
539
I mean, this is what I've noticed: Democrats, Republicans, populists, or elitists, whatever side of the spectrum on whatever dimensional category you want to assess.
540
an individual or representative on, at the end of the day, they're just trying to use the government to deploy capital to their constituents as best they can.
541
I mean, that's the mechanism of the electorate at this point.
542
And just hearing your words resonates with me because I've made a number of visits to D.C.
543
in the last couple of months since the inauguration, and there was a lot of proclaim about Doge and it's a new day in Washington.
544
And I felt a degree of optimism and hope that things were changing in D.C.
545
But every member of Congress I sat down with was a disappointing conversation that reflects the views that you just shared that they don't really understand what's going on and they don't really care.
546
It's not a priority to solve the fiscal crisis that we're in and they're not willing to admit it.
547
It's like a stage four terminal patient not willing to admit that they're sick and they need to take some therapy.
548
Well, the data that backs us up is, and I wrote this in my Wall Street Journal column, 1930, the federal government spent about 3.5% of our GDP.
549
3.5%.
550
State-hold governments were about 9.1%.
551
That was the foundational premise of America.
552
Government calls the governed, where it's more effective, more efficient, more accountable.
553
Now we're spending close to 24%, the federal level.
554
States are probably somewhere 12 to 15 and having what that recently.
555
And as Lord Acton pointed out, power corrupts.
556
Government is power.
557
That's what I mean.
558
That is really the definition of government is power.
559
And so it gets corrupted, and it's been corrupted.
560
And I don't know, we're, you know, I fear we're passing points.
561
I can't give up on it.
562
I'm not overly optimistic.
563
And again, it's not just the, as government grows, your freedom recedes.
564
As government grows, you get more and more people dependent on it.
565
Well, that's right.
566
And they're not doing things productive.
567
You don't have a vibrant economy.
568
That's right.
569
You know, it's just, it's a, it's, it all, all in all, it's destructive of society.
570
To the point about your numbers, Senator, you know, and I've talked about this on our show, where I've tried to estimate what percent of Americans gain their employment through government paycheck, servicing the government, or a government contractor.
571
And I think it's probably at 50% today.
572
So 50% of Americans are either working for a public agency, federal, state, or local, or working for the contractor of a government agency.
573
And that's where you pass the tipping point where it's no longer possible to bring down the spending because at that point, everyone in a representative democracy has every incentive to keep it up.
574
Otherwise, they will individually lose, not just have something individually to gain.
575
That's where I worry we're at.
576
I guess the hardliners like yourself may be the last line of defense here.
577
That's where I was really curious to hear how far are you willing to take this in this particular reconciliation bill process that's about to hit your desk in the next couple of weeks.
578
And who else is shoulder to shoulder with you with this same point of view in the Senate?
579
I think Rand Paul is pretty much a hard no, regardless.
580
Again, I don't think you can get a good enough bill where he'd vote yes.
581
My other allies for sure in this thing are Mike Lee and Rick Scott.
582
You know, each one of us has our own thoughts.
583
You give me something that, like I say, commits to getting to a pre-pandemic level of spending and the process to achieve, maintain it.
584
I'll work with you.
585
Now, one of the things I did, and we had it pinned to my top of my next page, I think it's further on down now, but I put together a video about a minute 30 starting with President Trump and State of the Union saying he's going to bounce the federal budget and then the vice president and everybody on down some version of, we don't have a revenue problem, we have a spending problem.
586
And the very end of the video, I asked, so are we willing to fix it?
587
You know, right now, it doesn't appear we are, but I intend to insist that we do.
588
So I'm going to dig my heels in.
589
There's nothing that President Trump can do to pressure me other than start work with me, acknowledge the numbers.
590
I'm texting, they're probably annoyed with me, Besant and Hassett and Russ vote all the time, said, here's my viewpoint.
591
What am I not getting right?
592
So they know exactly what I'm thinking.
593
They know exactly my concerns.
594
They know exactly the numbers.
595
I had a good nice lunch with Scott Besson in the Treasury Department.
596
I gave him my charts and graphs, all that kind of stuff.
597
He asked for the electronic versions of those so he could distribute those to the Treasury Department.
598
So none of this should come as any surprise to anybody.
599
And again, the ace I hold is: I am going to force the numbers that we have to look at out in the public.
600
Because to this point, we haven't discussed it.
601
And the number from your perspective, if you had to create a hierarchy of just in your messaging, is the number that we should take away is that we're about to tune the debt to 60 to 70, so call it 65 at the midpoint.
602
Is that the number that we should be focused on?
603
I first focused on spending.
604
Okay.
605
89.3 trillion.
606
Again, that's, again, that represents government, right?
607
That represents that power that's been corrupted.
608
That represents the just unprecedented, other than World War II, increase in spending from 2019 of 58 to 60%.
609
So if you can't deal with that, in my column, I pointed out our forefathers, the greatest generation, responsible leadership, entered World War II spending about 11.7%, ramped it up to 41% during the war.
610
By 1948, they were down to 11.4%.
611
So it's entirely possible, but you need leadership.
612
I need the President of the United States.
613
By the way, I've been in the White House with him.
614
I've shown him my charts and graphs.
615
He goes, I love this.
616
I love this.
617
The House ought to love this.
618
Has this been presented?
619
No, Mr.
620
President, let's go to the House.
621
Let's present this.
622
He didn't do that.
623
We need President Trump to embrace the reality that we are spending way too much money.
624
He was elected to defeat the D state.
625
You don't defeat it, spending it Biden's levels.
626
He needs to see the detail.
627
Again, I think, you know, to be charitable, I think he's been so busy doing so many other wonderful things that I support.
628
He hasn't focused on this.
629
I'm going to force him to focus on this.
630
This will be the moment, you think.
631
And so when you speak with Besson, does he think he can get the president there as well?
632
I mean, I always think back to Bill Clinton with his balanced budget economic poster boards that he put up, right?
633
Like, here's the simple charts.
634
Let me explain it to you.
635
And every American could watch that on television and understand what he was talking about.
636
Do we need that?
637
Do we get that moment, do you think?
638
Yeah, and again, I don't think the numbers are that complicated.
639
Yeah.
640
Just point them out.
641
You know, $22 trillion of additional deficit spending.
642
That's a Rosie scenario.
643
That's $2.2 trillion per year.
644
Obama, he averaged about $900 billion a year deficit.
645
Trump, before the pandemic, was about $800 billion.
646
But Biden's up to almost $1.9 trillion average deficit.
647
Clearly unsustainable.
648
We've got to get back to a reasonable level.
649
And by the way, if we do, I think the bond markets would rejoice.
650
We wouldn't be looking at a ramping up of interest costs.
651
We can talk about debt to wealth as opposed to debt to GDP because we've got that monkey off our back.
652
You said something interesting I just want to come back to, which is you said, when the government absorbs all the dollars in the system, there is fewer and fewer dollars left for private industry.
653
Just to build on this, one of the things that I brought up at the beginning of this year, I said the most important thing that you need is tail insurance.
654
The tail risk needs to get managed at the beginning of this year.
655
And there's a very important market that is a gauge of that towards private industry, which is called credit default, which is what is the risk of private industry not being able to pay back their obligations.
656
And unfortunately, through the course of this year, we've seen the cost of that insurance ramp.
657
But at the beginning of Liberation Day, there was some relief there because people saw a path out of this.
658
And unfortunately, we're back to almost near highs.
659
And it is the market signaling that first will go private industry.
660
And I think that if people can really understand that that's the cascade, to your point, that first card has unfortunately been turned over.
661
Now, we haven't seen the implications on Main Street of that, but that's what we need to avoid.
662
We need to get these markets to understand the bigger picture, but we need to show them something.
663
I think we also have to focus on economic growth through the private sector, not fueled by government deficit spending.
664
I mean, I don't know what percent of our actual growth came from $2 trillion a year deficits.
665
I think a pretty good chunk.
666
So, have we really had real private sector growth?
667
I think we have, but not as much as I think the headline numbers because so much of it has been fueled by the government.
668
By the way, that's also true in terms of revenue coming from the government.
669
I mean, it is true that we beat the CBO estimates, but that's because of trillions of dollars of deficit spending starting the pandemic years followed through with Biden.
670
Prior to the pandemic, we really weren't matching even the CBO's downgrade of revenue coming in after the TCGA.
671
We weren't hitting it.
672
But then you had COVID hit, and again, trillions of dollars of deficit spending that also boosted revenue.
673
So, again, all these people saying, oh, we're going to, you know, that tax increase that's going to be dynamically scored and it's going to pay for itself.
674
Listen, I'm all for dynamic scoring, but let's be realistic.
675
And again, I'll point out the CBO projection I'm dealing with, $22 trillion, that assumes we go from 17.1 to 18% of GDP in terms of revenue.
676
So, you know, if we don't cancel the tax increase and there's dynamic scoring effects, your thoughts about where the country goes into 2028.
677
One of the things that Dave talks about a lot is moments that galvanize some form of populist socialism.
678
This idea, as he said very articulately, I can just vote myself the money.
679
So who is going to just give me the most money?
680
Can you just walk us through some political forecasting for us?
681
That's why I'm not an optimist.
682
But, you know, I've heard people rationalize this, and I mean, important people rationalize, you know, just go along with this.
683
Get us a patent.
684
I mean, this is what we have to do to win the majority, maintain the majority in the House in 2027, right?
685
Well, what good is the majority if you literally don't solve the problems that you're aware of?
686
Oh, so when we have the majority in 2027, then we're going to actually spend the, you know, turn the spending curve down.
687
That's when we're going to return to pre-pandemic level spending.
688
I don't buy it.
689
This is our one opportunity.
690
And right now we're blowing it.
691
And I'm going to do everything I can to make sure we don't blow it.
692
But again, that is the reality.
693
And listen, I don't discount the fact that we may lose the House, we may lose the Senate.
694
But I would say we do that because we're not solving these problems.
695
We're going to be looked at as unserious.
696
Our base is going to go, why did we elect you guys?
697
You didn't take the bull by the horns.
698
You didn't solve this problem.
699
You're really no better than Democrats.
700
I think we have to be concerned about that.
701
If this reconciliation bill gets done, Senator, in the next couple of weeks, what bill would you hope to see next to get to that North Star of fiscal responsibility?
702
Is there a rescission bill that you'd be looking at?
703
What's the right next step here in creating a North Star that creates stability for the Republic?
704
It's developing a process that will achieve and maintain a pre-pandemic level spending, just a lower spending level.
705
It is, I come from a manufacturing base, right?
706
You can't have a good product without a good process.
707
And we've just never had that process.
708
So the only one I can think of is what Doge has demonstrated does work in terms of getting the public supporting us in terms of eliminating just awful spending.
709
So you've got to expose it.
710
You've got to go line by line.
711
Again, there are thousands of lines, just top lines in the federal budget, hundreds, thousands of lines under each one of those as well.
712
So you have to do the work.
713
And again, I would love to take that Doge team, you know, those geniuses with all their AI and their computer skills and get 100, 200 forensic auditors and just go through this line by line.
714
And again, my proposal was have this budget review panel, senators, house members, members of the administration, OMB, then you basically set up a process just like you do in a business.
715
Here's your budget review sheet.
716
Then you bring the department heads, their financial gurus in front of this budget review panel, justify your spending.
717
But again, I would be comparing it to outlays under Clinton plussed up, outlays under Obama plussed up, outlays under Trump plussed up.
718
Go through every line and go, first of all, why are you spending more than even Trump?
719
Why are you spending more than Obama or Clinton?
720
Plus, why are you spending any money at all on this?
721
But you have to go through the work.
722
So you need the time.
723
I've been proposing this now for months.
724
The House said, No, we've been working on this for a year.
725
We're satisfied with our numbers.
726
We didn't have the time.
727
The Senate, really, the Senate leadership is the only one that's been fully behind what I'm trying to do here, but we can't do it alone.
728
I mean, I can't do it.
729
I don't have the budget expertise.
730
So, it literally is.
731
It's getting the commitment of the president that he is determined to not keep funding the deep stated buying levels, return to a reasonable pre-pandemic level of spending, and then get his OMB fully behind this effort.
732
This has got to be every, this has got to be the biggest effort on budget ever, and then set the thing up, show it works, and then hopefully maintain it over the years.
733
I can't think of anything else.
734
We've tried all this other stuff, it never worked.
735
Well, look, I hope you find a path towards that goal, Senator.
736
I think it's a critical time.
737
And speaking as an American, I appreciate your resiliency in the face of what I'm sure is a lot of political pressure and tension right now in trying to make sure that the right thing is done here for the long term of American prosperity.
738
So, thank you for your service.
739
Thank you for the work you do.
740
We appreciate it.
741
Appreciate you, Amy.
742
And I will say one thing that is different about me than others: I'd rather go home.
743
That's a significant difference.
744
I'd rather return to my private sector life than keep serving here in this total dysfunction.
745
That is what, again, I can't be pressured by President Trump.
746
I can't.
747
I mean, he's not going to flip me just by the force of his argument or any kind of political pressure.
748
There's no pressure you can apply to me.
749
He's willing to sit down with me, look at the numbers, acknowledge.
750
Well, I hope that there are others that get into the same mindset as you.
751
I have always found it off-putting that folks choose to be politicians as a career rather than rotating in and out of doing this as a service and then going back into the private sector where I think that a lot of the misalignments and conditioning can be avoided.
752
So, yeah, I appreciate that mindset and thank you.
753
Thank you, Senator, for your candor.
754
Thanks for having me on.
755
Transparency.
756
Thank you.
757
I mean, my conclusion today is similar to how I finished the pod yesterday, which is concern that the bond market is not going to take this well.
758
I do think that that puts a lot of pressure on America.
759
And I think it's going to put pressure on private industry.
760
And what will happen as a result is not necessarily that we go bankrupt or whatever, but there is no clear dividing line between public and private industry.
761
And I don't think that that's a great outcome.
762
Not to mention the value of everyone's assets.
763
They'll go to zero.
764
They go to zero.
765
I mean, look, but as the senator made the point, a dollar in 2019 is worth 80 cents today because of the inflation we've experienced from the rampant spending since COVID.
766
And if that continues, which is the steady state that we've now assumed, is we're now assuming to continue emergency spending as if it's the kind of standard, then that same level of decline in value of a dollar or decline in value of any American asset will continue and it will only accelerate.
767
And I think the worry is that in 10 years, you know, a dollar is worth 30 cents.
768
Yeah.
769
And that makes it harder.
770
The ability to buy a home, the ability to have greater wealth, the ability to improve your conditions and your livelihoods are significantly diminished.
771
That's the biggest consequence that we've seen many times over the last couple of centuries as countries have gone through the same cycle that the American Republic now finds itself in.
772
This is kind of one of those last stands of the Alamo, if you will, because the arithmetic gets to the point that it becomes unstoppable.
773
This train is gone.
774
So, anyway, I thought it was great to have some time with the senator to talk about it today.
775
Again, when we have these conversations, Jamath, obviously, we're not fully endorsing all the views and points of view.
776
It's good to hear from people.
777
It's good to understand their point of view, let them speak and have the conversation.
778
There are things that we'll agree with, things that we don't agree with.
779
But I think on the fiscal condition of the United States, I've been pretty clear, pretty vocal on my point of view on this.
780
And on this particular point, I think the senator is a very important voice.
781
I think it's really important for America to let private citizens have agency and do the things that they think they should be doing.
782
And I think that if you move to a place where we become fiscally crippled and reliant on the government, that's a horrible outcome.
783
Yeah, absolutely.
784
Okay.
785
Well, I'm glad we did this.
786
I know it was a push to get it done on a Saturday, but I thought it was really worthwhile to give the senators a vice.
787
I already made love to Nat twice this morning, so I'm from all the boxes that have been checked.
788
What did you do after those six minutes?
789
Did you have a chance to do that?
790
Played with the kids, played with the kids for an hour.
791
Yeah.
792
So I've done everything.
793
I've walked the dogs.
794
Good.
795
All right, bro.
796
We'll talk later.
797
Love you.
