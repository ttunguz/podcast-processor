1
AI companies that we're working with that have gone like zero to 10 plus in a year.
2
And contrast that with me, you've never seen that before?
3
Never saw that before.
4
We had zero to 30, 0 to 40, 0 to 100 in like 15 months.
5
These are insane growth.
6
Customers are like, they see these products and are like, holy shit, this is magic.
7
Thanks for joining us, Eric.
8
Thank you for having me.
9
We've known each other on Twitter for many years.
10
First time we've actually met in person.
11
Thanks for having us at the Benchmark office here at SF.
12
I thought I'd kick it off by telling a quick story.
13
All right.
14
Hope you don't mind.
15
Yeah.
16
So I'm pulling up an email from February of 2019.
17
So I guess six years ago, almost exactly.
18
And again, we knew each other from Twitter, but I sent you this cold email.
19
Hey, Eric, I'm Tyler Hoag.
20
Here's who I am.
21
Quick background.
22
We haven't met in person.
23
I admire Benchmark because of Andy Ratcliffe.
24
I'm reaching out because a few weeks ago I had lunch with Matt Miller at Sequoia.
25
And I asked Matt which investor he admires most, all in Silicon Valley.
26
He immediately said your name.
27
And then I saw your head-shave tweet about Confluent.
28
And it was pretty clear why I mentioned you.
29
Anyways, I went on to ask you a couple questions.
30
And I wondered if you'd be willing to tell the story here.
31
Basically, how did you pick Confluent early on?
32
And why did the founders end up going with Benchmark?
33
And we have a couple follow-ups there, but I'd love to start it off with a story if you're open to sharing.
34
Yeah, totally.
35
So a friend of mine who's actually cousins or second cousins with Neha, one of the Confluent founders, is the one who introduced me, JP.
36
And JP introduced me.
37
I was two weeks into my investing career.
38
You just barely started.
39
And you were a founder before, right?
40
Yeah, I was a founder before, and so I was like literally two weeks into Benchmark.
41
And, you know, but you're meeting all these companies.
42
And I had some experience with Kafka from my startup, Ryan.
43
And so we had used Kafka and it was like this great piece of technology.
44
And so we had some familiarity with the space, or at least with what it did.
45
And I kind of thought going into the meeting, like, hey, that's kind of this nichey thing.
46
It's a pipeline.
47
You know, it's a pipeline.
48
It's a messaging bus that puts data into a data warehouse or into, at that time, Hadoop.
49
And the thing that happened was, you know, Jay, Jay and Neha and June, but Jay, Jay led the conversation, he articulated a vision of why, like, yeah, it looks like this pipeline thing, but it's actually much, much more than that.
50
And there's going to be this big real-time data hub.
51
And this was, they were still, they still worked at LinkedIn when we first met.
52
So it was the initial pitch.
53
And it was developed internally on LinkedIn, right?
54
The technology.
55
Yeah, it was developed and open sourced while they were at LinkedIn.
56
And you're sitting there and you're like listening to this and you're like, huh, I never thought of it that way.
57
Nobody really has talked about it that way that I've talked to, or that I've talked to, at least in the investor community.
58
And yet it seems totally credible.
59
And it's a cogent view.
60
And then you kind of dig into it and you're like, you ask questions and everything else.
61
And you're like, you know, the idea, Chris Dixon's idea maze concept is so good.
62
And like, they know everything, including the things that they don't know, right?
63
Like, it's like, we don't know how fast dream processing will happen.
64
We don't know how this is.
65
Like, we think this is our theory of how it monetizes, right?
66
This isn't, it's not even a company yet.
67
And so I walked out and I sent a note to my partners.
68
I have that email in here.
69
I won't read the whole thing, but I would love it.
70
Can I share one or two sentences from it?
71
So this was really cool.
72
Because by the way, you're just engaging with me over a cold email and you said, thanks for giving me the trip down memory lane.
73
I also forwarded you the email I sent to Peter, Peter Fenton, after that meeting.
74
And here's what's cool about this: you said, Peter, Zach and I met with the three Kafka founders today, and we both walked away thinking we have to do this deal in bold.
75
So you got to conviction pretty quick, it seems.
76
Would really value your thoughts and help on this one.
77
It will go fast.
78
So can we meet as soon as you're back?
79
And then you go on.
80
It's a much longer email.
81
But what stuck out to me, and this will get into the benchmark model, is like you're immediately reaching out to your partner to help on this deal.
82
And that feels very, I don't know if that's super common in venture or not, but at benchmark, it's like second nature.
83
You guys are equal partners.
84
You're doing it as a team.
85
Can you talk about that and what you did here with Kafka and why you reached out to Peter?
86
Yeah, keep in mind, I'm two weeks in.
87
This is like, you know, like a lot of this is like just better lucky than good, right?
88
Like it's just better lucky than good.
89
Peter's one of the great, um, great investors, great venture capitalists in the history of the business, but but certainly amongst the top, I don't know, two greatest open source investors.
90
And so he was like a perfect, perfect person to reach out to.
91
And he replied and they set up a meeting right away.
92
And he actually said, I can't remember the exact timeline, but it was like a Wednesday or something.
93
He's like, hey, we should just get everybody, like, get everybody to meet together.
94
So the other, the other, there are four other people besides me at that time.
95
And so, like, let's just everyone go meet.
96
And so it's just like, you get the benefit of everyone's experience on it and their assessments.
97
No competition between the partnerships, no, like, like, I own this deal, you don't.
98
Yeah, nobody cares.
99
I mean, I think there's just like not a, not a, nobody cares about that.
100
The economic model is set up that way, so we should, we shouldn't care.
101
And, you know, and you kind of like, and through that, I still serve on Confluent's board, and it's been like an amazing thing to partner with Jay and the team from three people to, I don't know, 3,000 or whatever, from zero to 10 to, you know, a billion in revenue and more to go.
102
And like, I think it's just like when you get to go on those journeys, it's so special.
103
So it's a perfect segue, by the way, because I think at the time, you can fact-check me here.
104
Confluent was one of, if not the fastest-growing tech startups Silicon Valley had ever seen.
105
I think Sequoia said this the fastest growing company in their portfolio.
106
And then you tweeted just like two, three weeks ago this tweet, which I think should be the bulk of FunConvo here.
107
You said, hey, do you remember when triple, triple, double, double, double was the gold standard for annual growth in SaaS companies?
108
And Kafka maybe isn't a SaaS company, but I think the point stands.
109
And then you said, that was cute.
110
I assume you mean that's a remnant of the past and things are different now.
111
What's different?
112
What are you seeing?
113
So, I don't know how many AI companies that we're working with that have gone like zero to 10 plus in a year, but it's like eight or nine.
114
Like, it's some meaningful number.
115
Like, it's really like a lot.
116
And contrast that with you've never seen that before?
117
Never saw that before.
118
Like, zero to, like, you'd see zero to two, maybe.
119
Like, you see, like, those kinds of things, but like, this, this is like zero to 10.
120
We had zero to 30, 0 to 40, like, you know, 0 to 100 in like 15 months.
121
Like, I mean, these are insane, insane growth.
122
And, and we should just like be really clear that it's not the same.
123
Okay.
124
And it's not the same in good ways and bad ways.
125
Okay.
126
It's not the same in good ways in the sense that there's a lot of experimental revenue.
127
A lot of it is like, you know, MRR that's run rated.
128
And so it's not like ARR.
129
Like, it's not what I think of as ARR and what anybody should think of as ARR, really.
130
So it's like, it's not that necessarily in a bunch of cases.
131
There's going to be more churn.
132
There's like people are figuring out value and like all these things.
133
So that's the bad side, right?
134
The good side is like it's like real customers.
135
Like it's not like hokey.
136
A bunch of it isn't, you know, and each of these companies is different.
137
And I think like at the end of the day, customers.
138
So you do think it's driven by actual product magic, not some experimental AI budgets just to test it out.
139
There's real product value.
140
I think there's real perceived value, and some of it will get realized and some of it won't, but there's real perceived value for sure.
141
And it feels magical.
142
And the products feel magical to the customers.
143
And so they're spending money.
144
And I think this idea of magic and a magical experience is just like where people are like, whoa, here's my money.
145
And like, that could be, whoa, here's my money.
146
And then three months later, like, yeah, it didn't quite work for me.
147
And there's the churn you're talking about.
148
And then there's a churn and everything else.
149
But I was talking to an investor about this, and I was like, look, okay, take 30% off it, 40%, whatever.
150
Like, it's still insane.
151
And so there's still something happening and we shouldn't be dismissive of it.
152
And the irony is, to me, that we also have some AI companies that are like zero, like that are still zero in revenue and they're a year, two years, three years into development.
153
And I'm not actually bearish on those either.
154
Like part of me, I can make the case both ways.
155
Or is that old phrase of lemons ripen early, right?
156
Like you find success to child star syndrome.
157
You like don't grow into it.
158
Is this all?
159
I think that's real.
160
And I think there's a defensibility question that's really important here, which is, you know, some of these companies that are ripping are based, are like riding on top of the billions of dollars of investment going into LLMs.
161
And I think that's one of the things you're saying.
162
Like, you don't want to be fighting that.
163
That's for sure.
164
Great if you're riding it, but like, you do have to make sure, like, in most of these spaces, it's not like one company working.
165
In some of these spaces, it's like four, five.
166
Now, like, generally speaking, as we all know through as students of history, like that doesn't end well, like, even though four or five are initially working.
167
And that's because the market usually has one big winner, generally speaking.
168
Is that what you're saying?
169
Yeah.
170
And you just get the gorilla.
171
So this is, this is what's interesting to me.
172
Because Tyler and I were actually talking about this before.
173
We're like, this year, we're saying zero to 10, how many?
174
We put the over-under at 100.
175
If Benchmark has eight or nine, that, you know, okay, maybe 100.
176
That's probably a 10X over what it was, you know, ever before.
177
It's all-time high.
178
So here's the question.
179
Because that is, it's a really cool thing.
180
It's real.
181
It's going to be around.
182
It should change how founders think about things, change how investors think about things.
183
But does that mean you're like not a venture-scale business if you're not doing that going forward?
184
No, I don't think so.
185
I don't think so.
186
Because I don't either.
187
But I think a lot of people are saying that's T2D3 was the formula and now it's speed of zero to 10 or 0 to 100.
188
And that's like where I kind of like, that kind of rubs me wrong.
189
I think that's stupid.
190
I think that's stupid too.
191
I think that's dumb.
192
And I've never like the D2T or whatever that was, like the D2T3 thing.
193
Like I like, just to be clear, people talk about it and everything else, but it's never, never, ever how we looked at things.
194
And like, it just would never look at things that way.
195
We've talked about Confluent.
196
I think about Cerebris or Fireworks or some of these others that I work on or, you know, Sierra, which Peter works on.
197
And like, those are all.
198
And those were like founders in a deck, and we just did them and we did them with conviction.
199
Like we took a portion of them.
200
Pre-revenue, generally speaking.
201
Yeah, all those are pre-revenue.
202
They're all pre-revenue.
203
They're pre-company.
204
Yeah.
205
And so I don't think that is it.
206
I think there are different dynamics in each of these companies that have to be like torn apart.
207
But, you know, ultimately, for these in competitive spaces where they're riding the LLM thing and they have momentum, some of those will work.
208
But you need to make sure, double and triple sure, that the founder is an absolute assassin and that they are shipping fast and they have some theory of how the like quick sugar high turns into something durable.
209
For some of the others, you know, that where they're like developing maybe their own AI and it's not in conflict with the LLM stuff, but it is also not necessarily benefiting in the same way from the LLM stuff and the billions of dollars investment there.
210
It's going to take time.
211
And that's okay.
212
But I think what you end up with on the other side of that, if the market works and the AI works and everything else, is like, I think you might end up with something that's much, much more durable.
213
And there's not going to be like five of them.
214
There's going to be like one in most cases.
215
You brought up something twice there, and maybe I'm reading too much into it, but you used the phrase.
216
Feels like, how do you determine that?
217
And one thought I've had is: the more vertical you are, the more insulated you are from competing with the LLM.
218
And so potentially vertical applications might be a place to benefit from the LLM as opposed to fighting it.
219
How do you think about that?
220
Yeah, I think this is, I think it's a right question.
221
I kind of just think of it as like, okay, can I imagine if I fast forward to, I don't know, GPT-6, GPT-7, like if you start thinking in that context, like, you know, we're DeepSeek R4, like, is that going to do this?
222
Is it going to do a lot of what this product does?
223
Is it just going to eat it?
224
You know, and we saw a lot of this with the marketing copywriting stuff early, right?
225
Like, it's just like, it was like amazing.
226
Yeah, it was amazing.
227
And then it was like just cannibalized by the thing it was built on.
228
And, you know, and I think some of them are continuing to do all right, but like, like, but it's tough.
229
Like, it's tough in that space.
230
So I think there's things like, just to be concrete, like, I work with a company, Quilter AI, that does printed circuit board layout.
231
And like, they, they're building their own AI for it, and it's been a work in progress.
232
Like, and it's just, and its capability is kind of 10x'd over the last year.
233
And I think there's like another maybe order of magnitude to go before you start getting to like real, like, oh my God.
234
And I think that's coming soon because we have a clear path for it.
235
But it's not related to the LLM stuff.
236
And I'm really confident that like GPT-7 isn't going to do like PCB layout.
237
Like you're, it's just like it doesn't, that's not part of the training set.
238
It's not something that it.
239
And so, like, you know, that feels like it's like once you cross over, you get to something really defensible.
240
Um, and so those are like maybe concrete examples.
241
Super helpful.
242
Um, so if the triple, triple, double, double, double thing's not my question, too.
243
What is that?
244
What do you get excited about?
245
Yeah, what is the new one?
246
What, what, what is the standard?
247
And let's take, let's take those, like, you know, when you're at zero and you're building for a long time, it's just take it off the table.
248
When you are scaling, what should you be doing?
249
Yeah, what should, like, when you sit down and you're doing an AOP and a board meeting, it's like, when do you say, hey, guys, like, we got to go, we got to be more aggressive.
250
We got to be faster.
251
What's in the AOP?
252
Annual operating cost.
253
Oh, yeah.
254
Okay.
255
So I think this is just like very company specific.
256
And I think one of the things that happened in the SaaS world is it became a little formulaic.
257
Yeah.
258
And so the investor bankery type investors, like the banker type of financier investors, like they figured it out and they have to be.
259
It's like the alpha market.
260
And it's like, oh, the magic number and like blah, blah, blah.
261
And I don't even think it's just like, and you know, they're like, eh, and the pencil, and then therefore it should trade at like 13.2 times.
262
And it's just like, okay.
263
And you know what?
264
Like they were right and they made a ton of money investing in those companies because there was like an, there, there was an arbitrage between people who understood this business model and how like the really power of the business wasn't reflected in the income statement and like the durability and all these things and like different gross retention, net retention, all these things.
265
So there was like, there was an arbitrage from like, I don't know, 2012 to 2018 that just like these and these growth funds and like everything.
266
Like it, you know, everyone figured it out and like whatever.
267
So it's over, as ARBs tend to tend to do.
268
And I think this new and this new AI one, maybe there is like, maybe there's just an ARB on AI generally because like it's just like so powerful.
269
And if you just project it, like it's just so incredible.
270
But I don't, but I don't think it's like, but it's not formulaic in that way.
271
And so I just have trouble, more trouble with the plan and just kind of saying like, this is the standard on them.
272
It's fair to say like benchmark class is classic, but like game on the field.
273
So it's like a little dependent on like which wave you're riding.
274
And so you're like, hey, this plan and how we're thinking about growth, how do we think about it in terms of how does it position us to win and be one of the, you know, it's still more like that.
275
That makes sense.
276
Yeah, it's just, and you kind of think about it and you can look around and you can say, like, well, are there competitors dominating?
277
Are there adjacencies that are crushing?
278
Like, how are we, you know, cannibalizing?
279
What are the different things?
280
I was talking to a really smart investor yesterday.
281
And, you know, one of the things that he made the point on, which I thought was like, which I had never thought about, was one of the reasons that Cursor, which is obviously doing incredibly well, one of the reasons he thinks the adoption was so quick on it was that for the three years prior, Microsoft was like carpet bombing the market with Copilot and CopyK.
282
And so then this thing came along that was like actually really worked well for this thing.
283
And so like everybody was prepped.
284
And so these are things that we don't, you just have to really look at them.
285
Tyler and I were talking about this on the way over, but that's like there's a big difference between cursor and like Devon, for example, right?
286
And one of the things that you're talking about is the entry point and how prepped is the market.
287
And they tend to move, you know, an inch or two at a time, sometimes a foot at a time.
288
Don't move like 10 feet at one time.
289
You actually have a tweet.
290
Oh, Finch Robin.
291
No, no.
292
And so I'm just like, that to me is the point that you're making.
293
You have a tweet on this that I think similar concept, Eric.
294
You said, well, the co-pilot approach is all the rage.
295
I think we're going to see a bunch of areas where the AI just does, like completely does tedious work.
296
So let's talk about that for a second.
297
Co-pilot versus maybe pilot, or like it just does.
298
Do you think they graduate or can you, in many cases, are we going to see them skip to kind of the final version?
299
I think there's this, I have this idea in my head, which is a co-pilot.
300
I think there's a set of areas where co-pilot is the right approach.
301
And there's a set of areas where we're going to be AI and done.
302
And maybe some crossover as the AI becomes more capable.
303
The AI and done thing is like this PCB layout company where it's just like, you know what you don't really want?
304
Like you don't want to do that.
305
Like you just don't want to do it.
306
Like it's just better for a computer, go do that and come back and just be done with it.
307
But there are other things where the human guiding it or getting kind of superpowered on it is really powerful.
308
Or getting comfortable with it and then being able to.
309
I think that's another important part of this enterprise adoption thing that's going to.
310
It's like, oh, I'm going to check it.
311
I'm going to check it.
312
I'm going to check it.
313
And it's like, you know, it takes about 30 days before people are like, oh, I didn't really check it anymore.
314
And so I think both models will be there.
315
I think for code, we're going to get to a place.
316
You know, Dario made some comments, I think, today or yesterday about how much code generated is going to be actually by AI versus people.
317
I think that is clearly working and it's working really well.
318
On the other hand, you do have these cases, like there's one company I was talking to had hired a relatively junior engineer, and like 90% of the code was written by AI, and it was garbage.
319
It's just like garbage.
320
And so there's this other kind of irony of this, which is like the great engineer is going to actually be more valuable.
321
Like the truly great engineer, it's an amplifier for them in the future.
322
And there are other areas like accounting, or which we have company digits or, you know, legal work, like I think a lay of law, and like other things where it's like in that stack, like constructing a brilliant agreement and a legal contract, I just, I think that's like a, at least for the time being, like, that's a, that's a task for a human.
323
But there's a lot of underlying execution and rote legal work and paperwork and whatever that is like clearly AI can just do, right?
324
And so like those are kind of the dynamics to me.
325
You mentioned something earlier.
326
You basically, these companies that have scaled so well, a lot of them you funded just a deck and a team, pre-product, pre-revenue.
327
What is Benchmark looking for in order to fund somebody pre-product, pre-revenue?
328
Are these second-time founders only?
329
Are they, are there certain, like, how does it work at Benchmark for the partnership to get excited about a deck, an idea, and a founder?
330
You know, our former partner, Mitch Lasky, he's described it to me.
331
He's like teaching me in the, you know, whatever, 10 years getting started.
332
And he's like, it's not, there's no bar.
333
It's not objective.
334
He's like, the better analogy is it's falling in love.
335
Yeah.
336
It's falling in love.
337
I call it spiritual conversion.
338
Yeah, it's feeling true.
339
You like baptized.
340
You're just, you feel a connection.
341
You know, each of us will articulate it a bit different, and I think each of us has like different tastes and whatever.
342
But for me, you know, there's obviously this like big market thing.
343
Like, what's happening in the market that is going to allow this thing that really the world doesn't want to have succeed to like break through?
344
So like that's just like a big market thing and like what's shifting and like is there a seam and all this stuff.
345
You know, then you're like looking at the founder and you know, I just am like, is this is this the founder that is going to grow and scale and grow with this company?
346
And I think that that's actually a really important thing to me is like, is the founder a hyper-learner?
347
Because I find like, you know, the job at three people is really different than 30, than 300, than 3,000.
348
It's different at different scales.
349
Like these are really dynamic jobs and they're changing.
350
And it's really tough.
351
It's like, I said this before, like, I just, in some ways, it would be better if there was like CEO one and then CEO two and then you graduated CEO three, because it's the same title and same thing the whole time, but it's a totally different job, like every six months.
352
And then the third thing is really like, can't be, you know, can't be overstated is an insight.
353
And, you know, and we kind of talked about the J example with Kafka and the real-time data hub and like, hey, this is going to be a thing.
354
I think of that almost for every investment, probably for every investment, there was an insight.
355
There was somebody who, the founder came in, had seen stuff, and they were just like, no, but this.
356
And you're sitting here and like, we meet companies, all of us meet companies every week, right?
357
We're meeting companies every week, and you're talking to smart people all the time, and you're like reading all this content on Twitter and everything else.
358
And then like someone comes in in a domain that you know a little bit about at least and says something you've never heard.
359
And you're like, wait a minute.
360
And then you think about it and then you ask questions about it and you're like, that's totally urgent.
361
I don't know if it's right.
362
I don't know if it's right.
363
But it's at least logical.
364
It's well thought through.
365
It's well thought through.
366
And you're like, if that's right, and this person has an insight and they're a killer and like this market is big, like that's the, that's the formula.
367
That's the formula.
368
And, you know, on those kinds of things, we've, we've written really big checks like, just like that.
369
And I think like that to me is, it's rare.
370
It doesn't happen that often when you like fall in love and you have those three things and like all this stuff.
371
But when it happens, it's magic.
372
I mean, like, first meeting, you fall in love, or do you buy that, or does it take a while to get to the conviction?
373
Each of us is different for me.
374
I feel like I just am like, I'm a romantic, yeah.
375
So, I'm there, and I'm I think about um you know, Lynn and Fireworks.
376
So, um, they made they made the list two years in a row, right?
377
The exceptional startups listed.
378
It's an exceptional company, and hyper growth, and um, you know, one of these crazy like revenue-scale growth.
379
But she ran, um, she ran the PyTorch team inside of Facebook, the PyTorch engineering team, and and and the founding team, Kane, kind of came from, from, from the PyTorch team.
380
And she came in, and I generally don't like people from these oil state companies.
381
Like, I just find in well, you did LinkedIn and I did Facebook, so I think you might like it.
382
I would say LinkedIn to me was not a company.
383
It wasn't a oil estate company in the sense that like they were commercial, they grounded out like you know, like Google and Facebook was like monopolies because they were like, They were really duking it out.
384
No, I actually agree.
385
Yeah, LinkedIn had to do some hard stuff, Google just collected money so much, so much hard state.
386
You know, these other peak companies just like they poke a hole in the ground and the oil starts coming out, and it's like, okay.
387
Um, so I generally don't like them, and so you know, she comes in, and I tell her that in like the first 10 minutes in the meeting, that you don't like Facebook people, basically.
388
I just don't.
389
It's not they're incredibly smart and very talented.
390
But not great founders, and zero to one thing's a different skill set.
391
Zero to one's a different skill set, yeah.
392
Yeah, and and that, that's that's a much better PC way, a very euphemistic way to say it.
393
Um, and so, like, I, and, this is what we're doing.
394
This is how we did it in PyTorch, and this is how PyTorch came from behind and like beat TensorFlow and like, and everything else.
395
And I was like, 10 minutes in, I walked out and told the receptionist, I was like, please call Chloe, my assistant, and just, and, and, like, push my next meeting.
396
Like, push my next meeting because I need all the time I can because I'm doing this investment.
397
And then it took like six more weeks, and like, she still worked at Facebook, and like, you know, the team was leaving.
398
She hadn't even left Facebook yet.
399
She hadn't even left Facebook yet.
400
That's the other part of your playbook.
401
They're still employed.
402
Yeah.
403
And they work at Old Estate companies.
404
And so I, you know, I feel like that doesn't always happen, but when it happens, you feel like this.
405
And, you know, she subsequently pivoted, the companies pivoted.
406
So was the insight wrong?
407
Or was it wrong?
408
You know, the insight changed.
409
In this AI world, it was like a PyTorch cloud idea.
410
And then she was like, well, Gen AI is happening.
411
And really what people need help on is not building, not this like base layer, but one layer abstraction up.
412
And they kind of moved to that.
413
So was it the fact that she pushed back on you and was inquisitive and like stood her ground?
414
Like, what was it that she did well there that caused you to be like, man, I'm kind of in love?
415
And part two to that is like, is it the insight or is it that they have the ability to have an insight?
416
And you're like, even if this isn't the one, the way you got to this one will lead you to the next one.
417
You know, they're all, you know, they're all different.
418
Like, this is, this is the law of small numbers.
419
Like, nothing is particularly significant.
420
In that case, there was an insight.
421
Like, I always, I never understood why PyTorch, like, TensorFlow came, so I guess for your audience, like, hey, and TensorFlow came out of Google and it was totally dominant.
422
And if you look at like the NeuroIPS papers from, I don't know, like when TensorFlow was, it was like 99% of the NeuroIPS papers were like built on TensorFlow, like the things.
423
And then, like, three or four years later, it's like 90% PyTorch.
424
And, like, this, these are, these are big projects that are relevant to really good companies.
425
And so, like, how is it that a new framework came along and just beat it?
426
Like, I understand Cafe Antiano and some of the previous ones before TensorFlow, because they didn't have that kind of backing, but like, this is a totally different thing.
427
And she explained why, and she just articulated why.
428
So, that's part of the insight.
429
And, and, and then, why that insight would turn into something else.
430
So, I think that was like a really important part of it.
431
And, and you're just like learning.
432
It is the inquisitiveness part of it.
433
It's, it's the, it's the back and forth.
434
Like, um, one of the most important things is, like, why do we do this?
435
You know, and each of us has our own things, but for me, I want to work with entrepreneurs.
436
Like, that's the part that gets me out of bed.
437
Like, the investing part is like, whatever.
438
Like, it kind of like, that's a means to an end for me, but I want to work with entrepreneurs.
439
So, like, one of my other things is like, if this person calls me at 9 p.m.
440
on a Saturday, like, am I going to look at my phone and be like, uh-uh, where am I going to pick it up?
441
And I just like, that to me is like, that's such a good test.
442
You know, another kind of question I always ask myself on these investments is we've all worked with these amazing people in our lives that you trust and you feel, I feel a lot of loyalty to all the people at Rock Melt, for example, who stuck with me through thick and thin.
443
And I think they're excellent and I want the best for them.
444
And I was unable to deliver or lead us to, you know, an amazing company.
445
And I want them to have that opportunity.
446
And so one of the things I think about is like, would I, would I, would I talk Rock Melt people into like working here?
447
Would you send a friend to this?
448
Would I send a friend to this?
449
Or would you work for them?
450
Maybe age-adjusted.
451
Would you go there?
452
Yeah, would I work for them?
453
Or would I, and would I, do I believe that like I could very authentically convince people or sell people that this could be their life's work?
454
And like, there's a lot of businesses, like good businesses, which are, which I'm totally fine passing on and not working with, even though they're good businesses and they'll be good returns and they'll generate like venture returns because they like I wouldn't want to work with that person maybe, or like I don't have good chemistry with that person is probably a better way to say it.
455
Or I just find like it's just like, I'm just not a business that I get excited about.
456
Yeah, for whatever reason.
457
For whatever reason.
458
I'm actually very curious too.
459
What's the founder of Fireworks?
460
What's her name?
461
Lynn.
462
How did you meet Lynn?
463
Because the sourcing part of this job is tricky because was she meeting with five other firms that day or was it just you?
464
She's still at Facebook.
465
So how did you source this meeting?
466
So in that case, another founder introduced me.
467
Yeah.
468
Which is generally the best.
469
Which is the best.
470
I think I get a lot of introductions from other founders.
471
Was the other founder someone you had invested in?
472
Jay Kreps.
473
Oh, okay.
474
I think a lot of stuff comes from founders, like other founders.
475
And it's founders that I've invested in and founders I haven't invested in.
476
And that's so nice when they come and you get that.
477
It's the highest compliment that a founder can pay you.
478
And so, it's really special.
479
I do cold outreach, too.
480
You know, I like doing that.
481
I don't do it as much as I should anymore, but you'll see things.
482
Like, there was a company called Octant Bio, and it's outside of my domain, but I really respected the founders, followed him on Twitter, and he said, Hey, one of his early employees was going off to start a company, and he was so excited about it, and he thinks it was going to be amazing.
483
And I just like DM'd him right away, and I was like, Hey, I'd love an intro.
484
Like, that sounds amazing.
485
And I got to meet Nicholas Laura Stone through that.
486
And he came in as EIR and he started a company.
487
And, like, you know, it's a pleasure to serve on his board.
488
Like, I just, and so, like, that's a really special thing that happened.
489
That's awesome.
490
How often do you do the EIR play?
491
Is that a common thing here?
492
You know, it goes in fits and spurts.
493
I think, like, right now, I don't know if we have any, I don't think we have any EIRs, but in different periods, yeah, we'll have them.
494
I've done it three or four times.
495
Cool.
496
Any other questions we should dig on on AI or this other stuff before we switch topics?
497
Oh, you know, just the classic.
498
You know, you've.
499
And it's hard to know.
500
It is very hard.
501
Like, actually, I will ask one: venture capital.
502
Like, these founders are famously scaling much more efficiently.
503
You know, fewer people at least.
504
Maybe they're still raising big rounds, but do they need to?
505
The direct question is: is venture capital even needed in a lot of this case?
506
Will there be fewer firms in the future?
507
Is there, how does the landscape change?
508
And Sterling's point usually is like, won't it be the case that almost there's an adverse selection effect of the worst founders will raise venture capital now?
509
Because the best ones can just get so far without it, because you can create something much easier than you ever could before.
510
Now it's the stupid ones who need to raise venture capital.
511
It's also to your point earlier about, I love this, the investment bankification of, like, that doesn't exist right now.
512
No, it does not.
513
And so a lot of people aren't going to know how to deal with that.
514
A lot of firms aren't going to know how to deal with that.
515
So at the same time, as they're going to be struggling to adapt, you're having founders that there's a totally new way of building this stuff.
516
And yeah, I love, love that question.
517
I hope not.
518
Maybe is one way to say it.
519
I think it varies.
520
Like, I think there's going to be some amazing bootstrapped companies like Amazing that will get very big and very large and be able to leverage AI to like, to just like rip.
521
I think there'll be lots of things.
522
But to me, there's something that's lost in that, in the question, which is venture capital is two things.
523
It's, I put a lot of value in the partnership part.
524
It's both a part that I personally love, but I think I believe in it.
525
I believe in that value proposition.
526
And there are other ways to get that.
527
There are other ways to get that for sure.
528
And most of the great companies, if you talk to those founders, they had partners, like what we think of as partners around who help them and help them make the business better and push them and asked questions and were sounding boards, which is my favorite analogy for it.
529
But I think that's a really important part of it.
530
In some ways, the whole business of venture capital kind of artificially tied these two things together.
531
Yeah, they're bundled.
532
They're bundled.
533
And they don't necessarily have to be.
534
And so maybe there's some future evolution that is where there's.
535
Well, you answer another question we debate, which is like, what are the good reasons to raise venture capital?
536
And do you need, and is the money a pro or a con or a neutral part of it?
537
And what I'm hearing you say is one good reason that apparently some really, you know, obviously some fantastic founders have believed is that the value is in the partnership because they can get money from anywhere, but they choose to have this non-executive partner called a venture capitalist on the journey with them.
538
And so to believe that doesn't exist in the future would mean that you don't think that partnership's valuable.
539
You can get it another way.
540
Or you can get it another way without the money, perhaps.
541
But I think the partnership component is pretty like, yeah, if that didn't exist, then it's just money.
542
But if you have that, you can see why founders prefer that.
543
Yeah, I think it's a very special part of the job, and it's a privilege to get to do that.
544
We've got a bunch of early stage founders that listen to this.
545
Some may pitch benchmark at some point, some may not.
546
But for those who don't know much about how the firm works and some of the unique cultural aspects, can you talk about a couple of things?
547
So, one, for example, I talked with Chatham at Sundance a couple years ago, and he mentions the famous Monday partner meeting.
548
All day, free-flowing, unstructured.
549
Is this right?
550
Talk about why, and it's a little different than other firms, right?
551
How do you guys do Monday partner meetings?
552
We do like five or six hours of just us in a room.
553
And we're just partners.
554
Just partners, and that's all that's here.
555
And we're just talking.
556
Like, there'll be a company pitch, you know, maybe every other Monday or something.
557
There'll be sometimes a company comes in to update.
558
Sometimes there's a lunch guest or something.
559
But it's really just, and there's no agenda.
560
No one, there's never an agenda.
561
You just show up.
562
You just show up.
563
You just show up and you're talking about companies, what happened in the week, what did you see?
564
You know, things that are going on in your portfolio companies, like executive searches that you're working on.
565
Just.
566
So why not structure it?
567
Why not have five topics and go through, you know, like what's the reason to keep it?
568
One of the advantages of it is there's five of us, right?
569
They're five GPs and our operating partner or lawyer in the room.
570
And so there's no, like, the nice thing about that is like, you don't need to.
571
Like, you can, you can just, like, talk about what is most important.
572
I'll tell you what Chaden said at Sundance.
573
He said, people have proposed or talked about changing things, but then the fear is that you'll break something that's working and so no one will actually go through with it.
574
And you just kind of keep doing it.
575
Yeah, I don't, like, you know, and if we're done, like yesterday, I think we were done like 30 or 40 minutes early, and just like, well, it's like, fine, okay, we're done.
576
Like, you just move on.
577
So I don't know that there's any, and I think that part of what happens is like these firms aren't companies.
578
Like, we're not a company, actually.
579
And you want a loose and wandering exchange of ideas.
580
Like, that's what our job is to do, to see the present very clearly.
581
And to see the present very clearly, you have to just wander.
582
And like, you have to understand.
583
You have to debate points and you have to like do that.
584
And so that's kind of what we do.
585
And then we go and we go do some work.
586
And then we typically have a dinner guest or have a dinner with a guest here around this table or a similar one in Woodside.
587
And yeah, and it's like just a really, just another opportunity to learn, exchange ideas.
588
You brought up that quote: the job is to not predict the future, but to see the present clearly.
589
I think it's Peter.
590
It's Kohler's.
591
Oh, it's Kohler.
592
It's Kohler's.
593
Talk about that because a lot of people would say you're actually, you're trying to predict future markets and invest for markets that don't exist yet.
594
What does he mean by that?
595
Well, I think we should say, like, I think there are different venture capital models work.
596
Like, there's not just one model that works.
597
A few weeks ago, I was talking to Mike Spicer from Snowflake and Pure Sword.
598
We've been trying to get him on the podcast for two years now.
599
Yeah, he's unbelievable, like, and just an unbelievable track record and unbelievable investor.
600
You know, what are these?
601
He's like, he likes to.
602
He likes to start them and be the initial CEO of the companies and everything else.
603
And, you know, I think he'd say he doesn't like investing in other people's companies.
604
That is, that is a capability and here, which I, you know, like, what something to aspire to, but like, I can't do that.
605
Yeah.
606
And, and, and so, like, it's amazing that, that he does that.
607
I find it amazing to partner with founders in their earliest stages of development.
608
But I, you know, I can't help them, like, figure out the product.
609
Like, I can't do that.
610
I can't help them figure out the technology.
611
I can't do that either.
612
Like, and so, like, you know, that's that's a different element of it.
613
Um, I think I can say at times, like, that's not right.
614
You know, like, that's not going to work.
615
Or, like, we, you know, there's something busted here.
616
Like, you can say that and have that pushback, but I can't actually help them figure it out that part of it.
617
But then there are other parts where I think we can help a lot.
618
And so, like, that's the, that's the, that's the system.
619
And so, I think there's like different models that work.
620
Um, my mind is going somewhere around this.
621
Oh, oh, uh, I would love it.
622
Eric, would you mind sharing one thing you've learned from your other four general partners if we go through them all?
623
Like, what have you learned from Peter?
624
What have you learned from Sarah?
625
What have you learned from Chatham?
626
And then the fourth partner, fifth partner is Victor.
627
He's the newest, right?
628
Victor's the newest.
629
Anything you can say for each of them?
630
Sure.
631
Like, so I'll go in reverse chronological order.
632
So, you know, Victor is our newest partner.
633
He's a founder of Wildlife Studios, which is a game company, and with his brother, who now runs.
634
And then partnered with us actually as well.
635
And one of the things I think Victor is so, he's pushed me on so much is just like the job is like to work with excellent people and like period full stuff.
636
He's like, this is like, that's the beginning and end of it.
637
And he is also, and I just think that the clarity of that articulation is very useful.
638
Like I intuitively knew that, do that, but it's just like the clarity of it.
639
And so I love that.
640
And he has really pushed and continues to push me on like the risk taking.
641
Am I taking enough risk?
642
And I appreciate that.
643
You know, Chathan is pushing in a lot of ways too, but he is, I think he characterized me by his resourcefulness on figuring things out.
644
We cover a lot of the same stuff.
645
And so his ability to see like what is moving early and like what has actually started to break out and like what's interesting, what's getting developer mind share, everything else, he's maybe two or three levels more technical than I'm.
646
And it's so powerful, I think.
647
Sarah is kind of a, she's been a venture capitalist.
648
She started as an associate at Besmer and then.
649
And yeah, she found Pinterest there.
650
And then she joined Pinterest.
651
And I think the thing that she has through that training is like coverage, like meet companies.
652
One of the conversations Sarah and I have all the time is: if I have free time, I tend to call a CEO that I work with.
653
But the right thing to do, which is like nice, I think it's nice.
654
But like, but like, part of what it should be doing is like just like casting a wide net and spending time on that.
655
And then Peter, who's been here the longest, there's, there are so many things to have learned for him.
656
But I think the most valuable from an investing perspective is, you know, we don't do memos and we don't do this.
657
And Peter always jokes: if you have a data room, we probably wouldn't open it.
658
And like, and like, you know, and so, but so the question is, like, why?
659
And I think that the key thing is for most of these companies, there's really only one or two questions that matter.
660
Like, after you get through your founder thing, there's really only one or two questions that matter.
661
And I think his superpower is just like figuring out what those questions are.
662
That's the whole game.
663
And if you, everything else is bullshit.
664
And like, and so you go through these long memos and you go through the data rooms and all this stuff, and it's just a bunch of, it's just, it's just a bunch of pollution in your mind of really what you need to figure out, which is what are the one or two questions that matter.
665
You know, it's an interesting insight from, you know, Keith was saying the same thing.
666
He's like, I like to invest early because anybody can see and read the numbers.
667
And that actually like makes me worse than if I am, because I'm not focused on what actually matters.
668
It's the same point you're making.
669
It makes me, it makes me worse.
670
And again, I think probably worth clarifying that this is for early stage investing, right?
671
Like, that's data rooms start to matter a whole hell of a lot, you know, you know, when you're in your CED, you know, IPO kind of stuff.
672
But, but sometimes the initial momentum or lack thereof is pollution in your brain.
673
I think that's amazing.
674
And I think you're also saying the one or two things that matter after you've set aside the founder.
675
Like, the founder is like table stakes.
676
What are the key things that matter of them being a big company?
677
In addition, right, did I understand that correctly?
678
Absolutely.
679
Yeah, that's a great point.
680
It's just like what we care about is being part of the handful of companies that can turn into giants and that can be multi-billion, multi-tens of billion, maybe multi-hundreds of billion public companies.
681
Like that's what we, that's what we're here to do and like be part of those at the earliest stages that we can.
682
And, you know, thinking through that's like a very difficult, difficult task.
683
And each one of them is different.
684
I joke, it's like you're looking at kindergarten playground and trying to like pick out LeBron.
685
And it's like, you know, you're just like looking at the playground.
686
You're like, that one, that one's going to be, like, put up 50,000 points.
687
That's funny because the analogy holds because you'd probably go for the tallest one.
688
And that would, you know, probably be wrong.
689
Like, you want to look at other things.
690
You want to look at other things too.
691
And there's elements of it.
692
But it's, you know, there's a lot of luck involved and a lot of, you know, but there's some really cool things that you can pick up on.
693
One question I have, because, you know, don't do memos, don't like data rooms, got it.
694
How do you keep yourself honest about if your reason for investing, if that proved out, and regardless of the outcome, because it's all about the process and how do you go?
695
Again, it's the right question.
696
So, Sarah actually writes notes on the meaning she has so she can keep herself intellectually honest on it.
697
I think she does it, and she has a whole system around it so she can go back and back-check and everything else.
698
Um, I, you know, I understand that I am telling backstories when I like reflect on things and I think about them all the time.
699
So, I, you know, I don't know, there has to be an element of intellectual honesty.
700
Yeah, I sent you that.
701
I think when on our initial exchange with Confluent, part of the reason that was fun for me to dig up that old email is because it was like, what did I really think then?
702
And I ask myself that all the time.
703
For the ones that work, you know, and might kind of go off to the moon, I ask myself that.
704
And for the ones that don't, I also ask myself that.
705
Like, what did I see and what did I get wrong in the read?
706
And would I do it again?
707
Like, one, you know, one company, so Alex from Scale AI, I met him at the A and I spent time on it.
708
And I, like, I loved him.
709
And it was just so clear that he was like, and then he was like 20 or 21, like, he was so young.
710
And he was such a killer.
711
And, and he had this like autonomous driving, like, labeling revenue at the time, like, it, you know, and it's like people in the Philippines and like, oh, this stuff.
712
And I was like, that revenue is not here for this.
713
Like, I just did not feel like that revenue was long for this world.
714
And, and we kind of talked about it and everything else.
715
And I'm so dumb.
716
And, and so I didn't pursue it.
717
And I think I was like, I think I should have said yes.
718
Obviously, obviously, I should have said yes.
719
But I think if I had said yes, he would have gone with me.
720
I think.
721
And, like, idiot.
722
Like, I'm such an idiot.
723
And, like, I know better.
724
Like, you, so what you missed.
725
You know what I missed?
726
Is that like, was the pollution?
727
That guy.
728
Yeah.
729
Like, it is like, you had him.
730
He was such a winner, and he was going to figure it out.
731
You had Lisan Al-Khaib at the table, and you said, I don't like your business model.
732
I was so dumb.
733
It was so dumb.
734
And just like, so dumb.
735
And I, and I, and, like, I know better.
736
I know better.
737
I know better than that.
738
And I know I, and, and so you're, you're sitting there with someone at that age and that sophistication and talent level.
739
Like, their curve is like this.
740
There's no chance.
741
And, and you know what?
742
And even to go one step further, even if it didn't work, even if it didn't work, which obviously it has, but even if it didn't work, there's no chance I wouldn't have learned a ton.
743
Yeah.
744
And like, because of him.
745
Because of him.
746
I would have learned a ton from him.
747
And so just so dumb.
748
Can I ask this question?
749
And then I think I know the answer.
750
We got to wrap up soon.
751
You're out of time.
752
I know.
753
This is awesome.
754
I'll miss a buff light for this.
755
Do you regret the ones you didn't do, like the Alex ones that in hindsight you feel like process, independent of the outcome you should have?
756
Or do you regret the ones you did do and you're like, oh, I ignored X, Y, and Z, and I did it.
757
And I don't like, which one, which one hurts the worst?
758
Definitely Alex ones hurt the worst for you.
759
Because you only miss out.
760
You only lose one X.
761
You only lose one.
762
You know, I like, like I said, I've been very lucky in that the people I've worked with, I'm like happy to work with.
763
Like, I just, whether it works or it doesn't work, you know, Campbell said this to me, like, Bill Campbell was one of my mentors a long time ago before he passed and is a role model for me.
764
Like, that's what I want to be.
765
I think in time, 20 years from now, if people talk about me like one-sixth or one-tenth the way they talk about Bill, I'll be like, fuck, I did it.
766
I think my career was successful.
767
And, you know, he said this to me, and he was part of Apple and he was part of Google, and everyone talks about those, like, those stories.
768
But you know what is like forgotten when people talk about it is he worked with like schmucks like me also.
769
And he gave us time.
770
And he gave us time and he gave us guidance.
771
And he, and it, like, and I don't think it didn't matter to him that it like, you know, that like, I mean, it didn't matter.
772
It mattered, of course, but like it didn't, like, it wasn't like his, his, like, north star.
773
His north star was like the people, do I want to work with that person or not?
774
And like, that was his north star on it.
775
And to me, like, I, I just, that's how I'm oriented.
776
Like, I just want to work with, and so I don't, I don't feel bad about that.
777
Love it.
778
So we have three questions to ask everybody.
779
And you've actually talked about this throughout, so I think I could answer this one for you.
780
But what, what we call it the golden spur question, and it's like, what makes you the way you are?
781
What, what motivates you?
782
Why are you doing this?
783
I do it to work with the people.
784
Like, I do it to work with entrepreneurs.
785
Like, that's what I do.
786
This is a vehicle to do that.
787
And it's just like to be part of Benchmark.
788
I think that's the ethos of Benchmark from the very beginning is partnering with entrepreneurs and working with them.
789
And I just get so much joy out of that.
790
And, you know, and I think my partners directly push back, hey, you know, you want to be partnered with companies that don't need your help.
791
I don't know.
792
I think that you spend a lot of time on the companies that aren't working and a lot of time on the companies that are really working because like small improvements or small enhancements on those make a big difference.
793
And so like, I really like love that model.
794
I could have guessed you were going to say that.
795
All right.
796
The last two are pretty easy, I think.
797
The I/O podcast, that's what we call it, investor-operator.
798
So who is an investor you admire most outside of Benchmark?
799
And then who is an operator you admire most outside your portfolio?
800
Well, the investor, I have to say, Jim Goetz from Snequoya and Excel previously, but he, for a few things.
801
One, I'm hugely grateful to him because he told me to be a venture capitalist.
802
And like he told me that in 2008, and it took me six years to figure out he was right and like all this stuff.
803
But I just am like super grateful for him for that.
804
And then two, you know, there are very, very few people who had successful enterprise companies and successful consumer companies like WhatsApp and Palo Alto, I guess.
805
And so just an absolute winner and does it with class.
806
Love it.
807
What about operator, a founder that you just love?
808
You know, I mean, Alex, there's so many founders, but it would be, you know, like Mark and Ben gave me my career and they gave me my start and my career.
809
And Mark sat on my board at Rockmount and, you know, I was Ben's assistant.
810
And they're operators, they're entrepreneurs as investors.
811
And so I have a ton of respect and gratefulness to those guys.
812
Eric, this has been a fun combo, man.
813
Thanks for taking an hour with us.
814
We owe you.
815
We appreciate it.
816
Thank you.
