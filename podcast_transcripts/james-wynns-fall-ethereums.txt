1
We're an industry that has constantly been on the back foot with respect to legal.
2
So the idea that,, well, we've obviously figured out the holy grail, which is the foundation model, is crazy.
3
But you have to get lawyers to say yes to that.
4
Right?
5, each one of these companies that goes through CSX, they're already incorporated.
6
They have lawyers.
7
But the reason I think, again, is the market signal of safes and safts is that people fucking use them.
8
And end of the day, they did not even have to do that much marketing.
9
The SAFT from zero to usage, amazingly fast.
10
Token worth, same thing.
11
And so I think if you token words were not amazingly fast.
12
It took a while.
13
Compared to how long have you been hearing about Dunas?
14
I've been hearing about Duna for two and a half years.
15
I've been hearing about so many DAOs saying they're going to convert and then don't do it.
16
Not a dividend.
17
It's the Tale of Tufund.
18
Now, your losses are on someone else's balance sheet.
19
Generally speaking, airdrops are pointless anyways.
20
I manage trading firms who are very involved.
21
I the ETH, the ultimate honesty.
22
DeFi protocols are the antidote to this problem.
23
Hello, everybody.
24
Welcome to the Chopping Broccoli.
25
Every couple weeks, the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto recipes of the day.
26
So first up, we got Tom, the DeFi Maven and Master of Memes.
27
Hello, everyone.
28
Next, we got Robert, the crypto connoisseur and czar of Superstate.
29
Happy Tuesday.
30
It's not Tuesday when this gets released, so you might want to redo your channel.
31
Happy Wednesday or Thursday.
32
Thursday.
33
Happy Thursday.
34
That's true.
35
Happy Thursday, but it is a podcast, so you never know when people are listening.
36
Darun, the you brain and grandpubah at Gauntlet.
37
Yo.
38
And finally, I'm Haseb, the head hype man at Dragonfly.
39
We're early stage investors in crypto.
40
I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice, or even cooking advice.
41
Please see choppingblock.xyz for more disclosures.
42
So, Robert, do you want to give the backstory of The Shopping broccoli?
43
No, but one of our listeners jokingly refers to this show as The Shopping broccoli.
44
And so that's the whole backstory.
45
It's really less interesting than you might think.
46
No, we're embracing that for the show.
47
We intentionally picked out all the topics to be cooking themed.
48
So see if you can notice throughout this episode.
49
I'm completely lying.
50
That's not true.
51
Okay, so let's last episode we ended talking about the saga of James Wynn.
52
So just quick recap.
53
James Wynn is a UK-based meme coin trader who's been accused of being a weird meme coin pump and duppy type of person in the past.
54
He's very big moon pig shill.
55
And he's been absolutely engaged in insane, wild leverage trading on hyperliquid.
56
Big enough trades that is basically moving the entire Bitcoin market and has been captivating everybody on crypto Twitter.
57
So previously he put on positions that notional value of over a billion dollars on the price of Bitcoin with over 40x leverage and or not over exactly 40x leverage.
58
His P<unk>L peaked at over $80 million and basically he's now as of this week completely wiped out.
59
He was left with only $16 in his account.
60
He has claimed that this is because of shady market maker based manipulation of people coming and hunting his liquidation points.
61
So now because he's trading on hyperliquid and this has led to a broader conversation about transparency in exchanges and of course the fact that hyperliquid because it's a decentralized exchange or not because of but one of the one of the properties of hyperliquid as a decentralized exchange is that you can see all of the information that would normally only be available to the operators of the centralized exchange such as everyone's positions everyone's liquidation points as opposed to just seeing the overall picture of the order book.
62
So, his claim is that there have been all these big whales who have been hunting his liquidation points and forcing him to get liquidated.
63
So, the moment he puts on a trade, people go in and try to knock him out, essentially.
64
And so, he's been complaining about this, calling these quote-unquote market-making cabals and asking for people to protect his liquidation points to prevent him from getting liquidated intentionally by these market-making cabals.
65
He then later started asking for donations after he was $100 million.
66
Yes, he was big.
67
After he lost, well, notional, yes, after he lost all of his money that he was using to engage in leverage trading.
68
He asked for donations, made about $20,000 in donations, then deposited them to Hyperliquid, then claimed that he was being targeted again, despite the fact that he now had almost no money, but that they were coming for his shorts.
69
And then he claimed to give his final goodbye, saying that I've decided to give perp trading a break.
70
Many people have been speculating, including Yves Guinea, who was previously on the show, as well as Arthur Hayes previously on the show, that perhaps James Wynn was a psyop, that he wasn't a real person, and that this is some hyperliquid PR stunt.
71
I don't think that's likely, but people are really engaged in a lot of speculation about what exactly is going on in this very chaotic saga of the rise and fall of James Wynn.
72
So, on the backs of that, and a lot of the attention that's been brought onto Hyperliquid, we've seen Hyperliquid pump to all-time highs and incredible amounts of trading volume, over $244 billion of trading volume in the month of May amidst the James Wynn saga.
73
So, guys, reactions, the rise and fall of James Wynn.
74
Robert, I know you said previously that he was your hero and that you hoped that Hyperliquid would have some really messy, horrible liquidation gone wrong as a result of this thing.
75
Did not happen.
76
Hyperliquid seems to have weathered the storm perfectly.
77
What's your reaction?
78
My reaction is, Rick, to one of the interesting ones out there.
79
He was certainly one of the highest thrill-seeking and risk-seeking traders we've seen in quite some time.
80
Honestly, since Doe Kwan and 3ac, I don't think we've seen someone who's so careless with money at such a large scale.
81
And obviously, he was a tiny, tiny drop in the ocean compared to 3ac and Terra.
82
But it's been a while since we've seen someone so carefree throwing around nine figures and 10 figures.
83
And it was wonderful entertainment for the week or so that we had James Wynn in our lives.
84
I'm sad to see him gone.
85
I don't think he can bounce back from this, frankly.
86
He is definitely a problem gambler.
87
He definitely has some serious issues that he has to resolve.
88
But,, he definitely stress-tested Hyperliquid.
89
He definitely created some new conversations around manipulation of markets and hunting shorts and transparency and all this, which I think is obviously nonsense.
90
And I think the net result of James Wynn is going to be one in which people don't try to replicate what he did.
91
And it'll be a long time before we see another James Wynn trading a billion dollars of Bitcoin, long and short, long and short, on a radically transparent DEX.
92
Why do you say that you're skeptical of this?
93, people hunting.
94
By the way, by the way, you guys are, you guys, this entire conversation is moot because James Wynn has opened new positions in the last four hours.
95
Of how much positions?
96
A few millions, not hundreds of million, but Mr.
97
Never doing perps again is definitely.
98
Yeah, he's a problem gambler.
99
He's taking every ten thousand dollars he could find, putting it back in.
100
It's it's, yeah, it's he's definitely seat cushing searching, but he's still opening bets.
101
So you're treating, you said rest in peace.
102
He's not resting.
103
Fine.
104
Yeah, in reality, there are a lot of James wins out there.
105
That's where exchanges make their money.
106
That's why they offer 40x, 50x, 100x leverage is for crazy people.
107
And most, most, most people who are this, they don't advertise their positions.
108
They don't post, hey, I just entered 100x long on Binance or whatever.
109
They're just doing it.
110
And most of the time, they're just getting horrendously liquidated.
111
Can we play a fun intermission game right now?
112
What is the most leverage you've ever used trading a crypto product on a DEX, on a centralized exchange, through whatever?
113 what is the highest you've personally cranked up the leverage knob on any trade?
114
I've never traded with leverage.
115
Never?
116
Really?
117
Never.
118
Yeah.
119
No.
120
What about in life?
121
Never get levered up.
122 what?
123
I'm very, I'm, I'm extremely long life.
124
I'll say that.
125
Extremely live.
126
I feel you're a 5x, 10x guy.
127
No, no, no, no.
128
I'm all about risk management.
129
I'm more of a 3x guy.
130
Whatever the U.S.
131
government says is allowed in a traditional brokerage, that's what I subscribe to because they know best.
132
But it is feel,, obviously there's no crying in a casino, as we all know.
133
But it's not the first time,, even if you're trading size on a centralized exchange, people are still going to try to hunt your stops.
134
And we've seen this before when famous addresses are,, close to being liquidated on lending protocols.
135
They also get hunted.
136
And so there's always, I don't know, it isn't a new phenomenon, but it is funny to me that how mainstream this topic now is, even though this has always been true.
137 even CZ was talking about the need for a per dark pool or dark pool perks.
138
And so I don't know, maybe this is this will be the catalyst for true DeFi privacy.
139
I doubt it, but I doubt it.
140
Yeah.
141
Yeah.
142, it has been going on a long time.
143, Arthur used to joke about this in the BitMex troll box, way back in the day about hunting the stops of the plebs.
144
So, so I think, and I was trying to explain this to a ZK founder, there's no way of preventing hunting, right?
145 in anything that has partial liquidations, I can look at the OI and the collateral, which are public, and impute, at least probabilistically,, how much someone was liquidated, what their threshold was.
146
Now, I won't be able to do it perfectly, but I'll be able to get enough information to figure out statistical strategies to hunt them.
147
I think that, that in and of itself was probably the real reason I think the CZ thing is missing the point.
148
You can still hunt people on Binance.
149
It's just that you have to take more risks to do it versus it's close to deterministic on-chain.
150
But my max level ratio is...
151
I think there's a pretty, that's clearly a difference, though, right?
152
It's obviously one of degree, but the degree is probably pretty significant.
153
If with certainty that you can take this person out with enough money, then yeah, there's a lot of people who are just depopulating engage in liquidation.
154
There is, that's true, but I also think if I'm trading on Binance and I'm in the same co-located exchange and I can see all the orders first, I basically have the same ability as the pure on-chain.
155 it's closer to deterministic.
156 my probability is really now about latency.
157
And I'm not saying that it's, hey, I'm just trying to say, I don't think centralized exchanges are some perfect paragon of, hey, this never happens there either.
158
That's the thing I don't about this discourse because it's pretending that that's true, but it's there's not there's not a binary yes or no to this question.
159
And I think somehow everyone's own bags are incorporating them to show that it's a binary thing and they're on the virtuous side of the spectrum and the other one is the evil villain.
160
I agree with you.
161
It's not binary.
162
It's not binary, but there is a concern.
163
No, no, no, but you read the arguments they're making, they're trying to claim it is binary.
164 CZ's arguments are very much one or the other.
165
He's, private decks is the only way to replicate how good centralized exchanges are.
166
It's not true.
167
Okay, so there's been a big back and forth, especially in the wake of James Wynn's claims of, hey,, he's getting his stops hunted.
168
Is you had Jeff from Hyperliquid come out and engage with a very, very long essay that he wrote up, basically describing why he felt that a quote-unquote transparent exchange to the extent that Hyperliquid is, where it's not only that you can see the order book, you can see all the traders, you can see all their deposits, you can all see their positions, but not only that, exactly who they are and people are playing iterated games because they have a fee tier and someone is going to stay in the same account.
169
They're not very inclined to rotate different accounts.
170
And his claim is that this is good for most people who matter.
171
It's bad for high frequency takers.
172
Those people are getting hurt.
173
But for makers and for retail, and even for whales, his claim is that this is better.
174
And it's better because it allows people to, if they're toxic flow, meaning they're informed, they know something that the market maker doesn't, it allows them to get filled more readily by market makers because those market makers know this.
175
They can basically look at this person on chain and be, oh, it's that guy.
176
And that guy is an idiot.
177, that's James Wynn.
178
He doesn't know anything.
179
He's just going along Bitcoin because he's a wild gambler.
180
So I'm very happy to provide him liquidity.
181
But if it's,, Jump or somebody else, I'm, okay, well, this person maybe knows something I don't, and I don't want to be on the other side of this trade.
182
So his claim is that this is net good.
183
This new market structure where you can see everything is good.
184
And CZ was on the other side of this.
185
CZ wrote a mini essay where CZ's claim was this is not good.
186
And I think it was also Anand, who's one of the founders of Paradigm as well as Paradax.
187
And he was saying, look, this is not the way that anybody in traditional finance, Paradigm Markets, Paradigm Markets, the options trading menu.
188
His view is that, look, nobody in traditional finance, nobody at a hedge fund, nobody who's doing moving real size in markets thinks that that's true.
189
You can see that in their behavior, that they go to dark pools, they go to OTC desks, they don't want to show their size, and they go through a lot of effort to hide their positions and hide who they are when they're engaging in large trades, whether or not people know that they're informed actors.
190
So there's this big debate now about, is the hyper-liquid structure of everyone can see everything, is this good?
191
Because it allows this price discrimination?
192
I feel this is just rehashing the 2020 AMM versus centralized exchange spot exchange debates where everyone was constantly the Dan Robinson versus SBF.
193
I feel this is just people who weren't paying attention then rehashing the same arguments.
194
And there's, it's a dialectic.
195
There's, there's reason, there's a spectrum.
196
You get certain utilities to one, you have certain disutilities to the other, and you as a user get somewhere in the middle.
197
The rest, well, who the fuck cares?
198, everyone's talking about the book.
199
Yes, the centralized one is saying their model is best.
200
The decentralized ones are saying their model is best.
201
Yeah, I think that's all.
202
You gotta use, just understand that there's a spectrum of decisions you can make.
203
There's a spectrum of users who do better or worse on each of these exchanges.
204
And those users will gravitate to those places.
205
And there's probably not really one that's better.
206
That's it.
207
That's a fundamental truth.
208
Now, everyone talking their own book obviously wants to tell you the other one is the evil villain, but it's not true.
209
It's they both have places in society.
210
Tom, do you agree with this stake?
211, I think I agree in the sense that there's a spectrum.
212
I think they point to the contrast of ETFs where ETF flows are basically extremely well forecast when there's going to be a rebalance and when there's going to be,, new sells or flows.
213
And yet that ultimately doesn't really affect the performance of an ETF.
214, depending on, and,, also, obviously, market makers knowing the fact that, hey,, this particular sponsor is the one that's going to be executing this.
215
So I don't know.
216
I agree with Tarun that,, in the grand scheme of things, ultimately, there's going to be info leakage some way or another.
217, I,, I also see your points around maybe it does, it is a little bit worse to know that someone's specific liquidation point or someone's specific account value versus some probabilistic estimate of it.
218
But, ultimately, I don't know if it really makes that big of a difference.
219
I think it makes a bigger difference than Tarun, you and Tom are giving it credit for.
220, I don't know if it's a good idea.
221
I'm not saying it doesn't make a difference.
222
I'm just saying it's just preferencing certain users versus others.
223
But there's always, it's a zero-sum thing.
224, there's always each other.
225
Right, right.
226
But I think it's pretty clear that you don't want to be encouraging people who are hunting stops.
227
Right.
228
That is the one thing that's probably not economic.
229
What are you talking about?
230, everyone was always just Arthur is hunting stops on BitMEX.
231
This is the same thing.
232
It's the difference in the world.
233
Right, right, right.
234
And obviously, if they're, if they're choosing against something that is considered marketing, different probability estimates, I agree.
235
But,, I don't think you, there every microstructure will have some amount of this.
236
And the question is, is there some perfect one?
237
And the reality of the answer is no.
238
No, the question is not.
239
I think this argument that Jeff makes a lot is assuming the end state and ignoring the path.
240
Because the path of ETFs was that you had super huge fucking slippage in the early days of iShares ETFs.
241
Those things were not tracking at all.
242
Those things looked these 3x short ETFs, inverse ETFs, which are just diabolically bad at tracking error for a bunch of reasons, fee reasons, there's not enough borrow, dot, dot, dot, right?
243
Locate is hard.
244
And what happened over time is the ETF market learned to become efficient, and the underwriters started outsourcing all their execution to these brokers.
245
And so it became this game between the two different types of HFT people, right?
246
And then that made the market equilibrium price go down.
247
And all I'm saying is you choose a market structure that attracts certain participants and you get some equilibrium.
248
And, yes, there's some difference in probability of certain types of things being sniped versus not, but there's no way of, oh, I've eliminated everything in my one model.
249
And, I think the way that everyone talks about it is as if there is this thing that one secret trick that eliminates all X, Y, or Z is a bullshit, answer.
250
It's marketing.
251
It's not real.
252
It's not mathematical reality.
253
No, I was going to say back to the mathematical reality.
254
We cut you off Turin before when you were about to say your maximum leverage that you've used.
255
Yes, yeah, I got cut off twice.
256
I was trying to say it 5.7x.
257
5.7?
258
Wow.
259
Okay, you're definitely going to say, is there a reason why it's 5.7?
260
I love the number 57 for many different reasons.
261
But I was not going to take 57x.
262
Is 57 prime?
263
It's not prime, but there's this very famous mathematician who thought it was a prime and wasted many months of his life trying to prove some property of some abstract thing because someone asked him to do it with 57.
264
So I think it's just a funny thing of, if you get too lost in the weeds of abstraction, you forget basic stuff and then you can't do anything in the future.
265
Yeah, it's a multiple thing.
266 57 is a moral lesson of that form.
267
It's called the Grothendieck prime.
268
He didn't realize that he could just find some tools.
269
19 times 3?
270
Yeah.
271
No, no, no, yeah.
272
So this guy is the king of algebraic geometry and did not believe in anything that you could compute something for.
273
It was, it's a certain philosophy and the more extreme end of abstract math.
274
And so someone after a talk he gave was, can you just do this with a real prime number and show me that it works?
275 give me a full explicit example and compute something.
276
And he was, okay, let me pick a prime 57.
277
And then he spent an hour trying to do it.
278
And obviously the thing didn't work because it wasn't prime.
279
But he didn't think that it wasn't prime.
280
He just kept going.
281
And I think that's a lesson, a lesson you can often see even in just using LLMs where you give them the wrong input, they just keep going forever on non-focused.
282
What was the name of this mathematician?
283
Alexander Grothendieck.
284
He died on an island off the part of France because he was a little bit the Unibomber and just didn't believe society was good and whatever.
285
Grotendik is the one who turned down the Fields Medal, right?
286
No, no, no, no.
287
That's a Poincaré conjecture guy who's in Russia, who's Russian.
288
Grothendieck's French.
289
Well, that was today's mathematics.
290
That's the one you're talking about.
291
Anyway, sorry for boring our users or listeners.
292
No, no, no.
293
Look, this is all part of the show.
294
This is exactly what everyone who's tuning in for James Wynn is here for.
295
They're all here for the mathematical trivia.
296
All right.
297
Well, so, okay, moving away from math, let's talk about the Ethereum Foundation.
298
So news coming out of the Ethereum Foundation and the notorious Ethereum Pivot is the Ethereum Foundation has now done a full-on rebrand of the protocol RD team.
299
So originally it was called the, what was it called, the protocol and development team or something?
300
Now it's just called protocol, capital P.
301
It's just, it sounds some tech publication.
302
But so protocol is now being rebuilt with a new reframing and leadership.
303
There are three strategic goals.
304
Scaling the L1, scaling blobs, or scaling blobs slash L2, and improving the UX.
305
Scaling the L1, they've assigned leaders or co-leaders to each of these three strategic initiatives.
306
Scaling the L1 is going to be Tim Bako and Ansgar Dietrich.
307
Scaling blobs or slash L2 is going to be Alex Stokes and Francesco D'Amato.
308
And then improving the UX is Barnabay Mono and Josh Rudolph.
309
And Dankrad is going to be overseeing the entire initiative as a, I don't know, L1s are or something, protocols are.
310
Several EF engineers were also let go in the process of this restructuring.
311
And overall, it seems that there was a lot of excitement around this new rebrand as being this crystallization of what people in the Ethereum world have been clamoring for, which is a refocus on scaling the L1.
312
Any thoughts, reactions on the announcement of protocol?
313
Taroon, given you're the close CEF, what was your take on this?
314, I feel I've been hearing this for months.
315
So I guess good to see it happen, but I feel people have been talking about it at conferences for a while.
316
It feels it was already down a while ago and this was more a public announcement.
317
I think it's good, obviously, to structure.
318, I think Dankrad has been,, if you've followed his writing compared to, say, Justin Drake, much more realistic about progress and what Ethereum needs to do than I think the historical leaders in ETH research.
319
But that being said,, obviously execution is the thing that matters, and we just have to see them do all these updates.
320, I think they're promising some big things 10x by end of year, which for Ethereum would be astonishingly fast that happened.
321
So, Tarun, a while back, this is probably a month ago, you had a podcast on Unchained with Max Resnick that got a lot of heat.
322
And I don't think you had a chance to talk about it on the show, but the two of you were very dismissive of Ethereum's ability to respond, rise to the moment and be able to scale in response to that.
323
Max was extremely dismissive.
324
I was taking the dialectic of,, do you think Ethereum will ever be Solana?
325
Because,, he was trying to make the point that,, look at Solana, really efficient organization.
326
And,, you think those people can ever convert, right?
327, that was his.
328
And I was just trying to rope him back to the center to be, you just moved there.
329
And maybe the whole thing.
330
Yeah.
331
Yeah.
332
The way I would describe it is that Max was, Ethereum is absolute fucking steaming hot garbage.
333
And you were, so why do you think that is?
334
Why do you think it is steaming hot garbage?
335
I would say it really started in 2020 when the garbage started to steam.
336
That was the vibe I felt between the two.
337
I was trying to pull him back to the center.
338
I felt, and I think most of the shit I got was just for doing that podcast.
339
It was, I was shocked how many people really, I totally get that Max can be, has been rude and whatever.
340
And a lot of people hold that against him in the ETH land, especially, because I think,, there were some incidents that probably were not the best.
341
But he has generally been right, right?
342 a lot of the changes they did were in response to stuff, you pointed out.
343
I totally agree.
344
But there is this psychological trauma in the Ethereum community around Max, which has reminded me to not do any more such podcasts for my own mental health.
345
Damn.
346
Did you lose friends over that podcast?
347
I got a lot of strongly worded,, fuck you's, which I was, all right.
348
I was trying to stay in the middle and somehow just got painted with the tar brush of from the left and the right, or where were the FUs coming from?
349
Oh, no, no, definitely not.
350
The Solana saw it again.
351
They were, whatever.
352
Wait, hold on.
353
Why is Ethereum Solana left and right?
354
Wait, where did that come from?
355
Solana's right, Ethereum's left.
356
Did you not see that commercial?
357
No, okay.
358
Yeah, I do.
359, I would be more curious to learn more about just day-to-day,, how does how do these teams set goals and goal themselves?
360
And how do you create accountability and incentives to do the right thing?
361
And what are those right things?
362, I think to Solana's credit, it operates more how I considered a Silicon Valley product team to operate, which is you have a North OKR and you have KPIs that feed into it.
363
And for them, it's everyone knows it, right?
364
It's increased bandwidth, reduce latency.
365, you all know it, even though you're not on the Solana product team.
366
And so when you think about what is our goal as a team, which I, as an individual, have as my compass, you, you are always dialed into is this moving one of those things.
367
Scale the L1 feels very ambiguous and nebulous.
368, okay, well, to what dimension, what metric are we tracking to scale that?
369, how do you weigh those operational everyday wins versus maybe some long-term thing?
370
And RD, I think, is a very different type of product function than standard product engineering.
371
So yeah, I just don't it seems a move in the right direction, but I just don't know what the actual incentives are and how they're tracking these things.
372
And you want all of your teams and your community to also feel that drumbeat.
373
And I don't know what that drumbeat is right now.
374
It does seem they're finding that drumbeat.
375
I get the impression that Tomash has really shifted the vibe within the Ethereum Foundation to say, hey, these are the three things: UX, L2s, and Scale Deal 1.
376
And Dank Red being at the helm of this does feel it's reinforcing given the fact that Dankrad has been probably the furthest out in being the most aggressive and calling for extremely ambitious scaling goals.
377
So I feel that seems it's being heard loud and clear.
378
And when I look at the comments to a lot of these posts, they seem to be reinforcing that.
379
Yeah, it's definitely better than what it was before.
380
I think the trap I'm worried about, which a lot of teams fall into, is they reward and incentivize shipping.
381
And shipping in isolation is useless, right?
382
You ship to achieve a spurious local minima.
383
Yes.
384
That's who too.
385
Thank you.
386
And so the question is for the math version of what Tom was saying.
387
Yes.
388
How do you get out of being stuck in a spurious local minima?
389
And I don't know.
390
I don't know what the answer is for the Ethereum team.
391
But again, it's a step in the right direction.
392
But it's, okay, unless we know, and everyone in Ethereum knows, but what is their IDRL?
393
I don't know.
394
So what they're missing is an acronym, is what you're saying.
395
Yes, that was all they were missing the whole time.
396
They just needed a little acronym.
397
They need number 100 and surge and purge and whatever weren't good enough.
398
No acronym.
399
No acronym.
400
Rhyming is not the same.
401
Rhyming is just not the same.
402
I the purge and the surge and all the different names of the missions.
403
But did what they meant?
404
Vaguely.
405
Yeah, vaguely.
406
So that's the problem.
407
Nobody knew what they were doing.
408
No one knew what they meant.
409
And again, I think those are surge activity.
410
Surge?
411
Yeah, what was the surge?
412
Robert, can you read her that surge was?
413
More.
414
More?
415
More.
416
More everything.
417
Honestly, I don't even remember.
418
There were too many steps in each of them, the sub-steps.
419
You remember the diagram of the whole thing?
420
I do remember the diagram.
421
It was just too confusing.
422
Verge had something to do with vertical trees.
423
That's the only one I remember.
424
Yes.
425
Yeah.
426
I just, there were too many things grouped together where I'm, these things don't seem the same, yet they're in the same bubble.
427
Okay.
428
And I just it was, I gave up on using the names.
429
Well, I think I will be excited for them to just ship more.
430
I know you guys are talking about local minima and all this stuff of shipping too much, but the number one critique is that they don't ship enough or they don't ship quickly enough.
431
It's the number one critique.
432
So I don't think they're going to get to a point where it's, whoa, you're moving too fast.
433
You're doing too much.
434
I think it's going to wind up in a nice equilibrium.
435
I think it will swing the yeah, shipping anything would be great.
436
I think, again, shipping as the destination or the goal or even in the surge and purge, the product was the thing they were celebrating, which is stupid.
437 you don't celebrate the product.
438
You celebrate solving some problem or moving some metric.
439
And that was never even discussed anytime.
440
So I would add one thing, which is there is a tacit acknowledgement in this reshaping of pure decentralized organizational structures being somewhat failed, right?
441
Because historically, if you look at Ethereum development, it was you have a fork that packages many, many different updates at the same time, right?
442
Maybe it's a storage update, maybe it's an execution update, maybe it's a bandwidth update, maybe it's a client verifiability update, whatever.
443
And you were only allowed to release updates if it updated in this almost the big, beautiful bill style thing, where it's you have to stuff everyone's personal incentive project in it in order for it to get into the fork.
444 what?
445
For it'd be big enough for the fork.
446
It's very waterfall-y.
447
Yeah.
448
And because of that, you didn't have separate teams shipping on their own cadence.
449
And this current setup, which is hierarchical, which breaks the pure decentralization development view, effectively says, Yes, we are agreeing that maybe it makes sense to have updates or forks for just some subsets of these, and some of them are going to ship faster, some are going to ship slower.
450
And I think that is has the EF committed to faster forking frequency?
451
Well, they've committed to them being different, they don't, it's not omnibus anymore.
452, you don't have to fork for and put everything at once.
453
And there are, they, I thought they were saying they're going to do hard for me.
454
I thought they were, I thought Tomash said somewhere that they were going to increase frequency of forks.
455
Okay.
456
I've not seen that.
457
If that's true, that that's great.
458
I agree with you.
459
That very much is this more Silicon Valley modern engineering style of iterated shipping and moving faster.
460
Yeah.
461
It does in some way counter a lot of what people look for in Ethereum is this extreme focus on that.
462
That's what I was saying.
463 even the org structure, you look at the protocols thing, it's very different than classical Ethereum.
464
Even though,, is always true in every society, there's always a hierarchy somewhere, right?
465
It might not be described as one, but there may be informal ones, and the informal ones can sometimes have a lot of issues, which I think is what this is also acknowledging.
466
Okay, so I feel to summarize everything that we've we've said together, Ethereum needs an acronym.
467
Anybody want to put one forward?
468
How how are we going to get this into an acronym?
469
Something that rolls off the tongue?
470
I'll leave this to Tarun.
471
Taroon, what do you got?
472
Scale the L1, scale blobs, improve UX.
473
What would that be?
474
That'd be super S-L-S-B-I-U?
475
I want the acronym to be duck.
476
D-U-C.
477
I want it to be Duck.
478
It can be UX.
479
The D can be decentralization, and now we have to backfit acronyms, things to the CK.
480
K?
481
We're going to hear K in there?
482
Okay, you can just do DUC, D-U-K.
483
I think Ethereum, one thing I love about Ethereum is everything has to have a logo and colors, right?
484, and the forks all have creative names and stuff.
485
And, I don't think this acronym would be Ethereum if it didn't have a visual component as well.
486
IBRL doesn't really have a visual component, right?
487
It's it's a very direct, and I think Ethereum can distinguish itself by having acronyms with visual accessories.
488
How about a mascot?
489
Should we also add a mascot in there?
490
Well, that's what I'm saying.
491
Duck is perfect.
492
Duck is awesome.
493
Duck is.
494
Duck would work.
495
I think Duck work forwards from the mascot to the actual.
496
Usually it's the other way.
497
Okay, I have worked in academic research where everyone's game is to make their paper have maybe not now.
498
Now there's too much of this that people stopped.
499
It became uncool.
500
But maybe 15 years ago, people would just work backwards from the acronym they wanted and they would change the fucking result or the algorithm they were writing a paper about just so they could fit the acronym.
501
Okay.
502
So the question is, how can we make Ethereum more duck- so that it fits with this?
503
Okay, I got it.
504
I don't know why duck was the first thing that came to me, but I'm, it's a, it has a D and a U, and decentralization and UX are the two things you're focused on.
505
All right, let's figure out the third one.
506
All right.
507
Censorship resistance.
508
Oh, there you go.
509
DUC.
510
Decentralization, UX, censorship resistance.
511
Okay, there's nothing about scaling, though.
512
We need to need some scaling in there.
513
Yeah, ducks.
514
Ducks.
515
Easy.
516
S is easy.
517
Okay.
518
All right.
519
Let's see if we can make this catch fire.
520
This is a fetch.
521
This is a mean girl's fetch type thing.
522
I don't know if we're going to succeed.
523
But hey, in my mind, Duck.
524
I think it is the one piece that's missing.
525
It's the one piece that's missing is we need a cube mascot, we need an acronym, and we need something that people can just repost over and over again in response to every.
526
What if you made it Scud and you had a little missile, and that was the character for the mission?
527
In a world where one can spend $1 million on drones to destroy billions of dollars of equipment, I don't know if Ethereum wants to.
528
Yeah, it's true.
529
We need to use a smiley missile.
530
Yeah.
531
It's a scud.
532
Yeah.
533
No, we just hard pivot from the rainbows and the missiles.
534
You got to out-baste the Solana mountains.
535
That makes sense.
536
No,, yeah, go one layer deeper.
537
All right.
538
Okay.
539
Well, speaking of decentralization, there was a big article that came out that got a lot of people talking from Miles Jennings, who's the head of policy, I believe, at A6NZ Crypto.
540
And Miles put out a piece calling for the end of the foundation era.
541
So for those of you who are not in the weeds of crypto protocol structuring?
542
Maybe you don't know what this is talking about.
543
But here's the high level.
544
Today, when you have an L1 or any protocol, generally what you'll do is you'll start a company and you'll go raise money from VCs, people us.
545
And when you raise that money, you don't raise that money into the thing that launches the token.
546
You raise that money into usually a company that is a for-profit entity that might be in the US, might be wherever it is that you are hiring people and running your company.
547
And so this is often called the Devco for the developer company or development company.
548
But what ends up happening is when you launch the token, you go overseas to one of these tax havens, to the Cayman Islands or Panama or whatever, and you create a foundation there, a nonprofit.
549
And this foundation is what is going to be issuing the token.
550
It's what's going to be receiving the tokens and the token issuance.
551
It's going to be responsible for all the marketing and distribution and blah, blah, blah, largely as this regulatory and tax hack that's developed over the last several years to try to prove that,, hey, even though there are people who are working on this protocol and continuing to be in service of all the things that are necessary for it to grow and to be broadly useful, it's no longer tied to the development work of the original team, which is the development corporation in the US or in whatever jurisdiction is being built that is largely serving as a contractor to this foundation.
552
Okay, so this is the Devco foundation setup, which has existed, I don't know, forever.
553
Compound had to be found.
554
Not forever, post-ICO, right?
555
No, there was no problem.
556
Yeah, before ICO, before ICO, 2016, right?
557
Well, yeah, Ethereum had.
558
Obviously, the Ethereum has been.
559
Yeah, yeah, 2016.
560
2016 or 15.
561
I'm just trying to get a while.
562
It's almost a decade.
563
We're so old chalking.
564
So it's a very, very old structure that originally was just people thought,, hey, maybe this will work.
565
And especially after the Gensler SEC, it just became de facto, this is what you do.
566
Every single company in crypto got the same legal advice, which is if you're going to launch a token, use this structure.
567
So, Miles Jennings has basically described what everybody in crypto knows, which is that these foundations, although they might be legally understandable why people are doing this, they suck.
568
They're just so horrible and bad because they basically mean that if you want to run a foundation and launch a foundation, what you have to do is you have to go get,, these things are, for example, in the Cayman Islands.
569
You can't be an American and run a Cayman foundation.
570
You have to go find Cayman-based directors who will be responsible for that foundation.
571
They will run the foundation charter, and you hope that these are going to be good stewards of the thing.
572
And that foundation has to work with the DevCo, which has the founders, and they have to negotiate back and forth.
573
And people often get into spats with the foundation where the foundation wants to do something else, and they get really risk-averse because they're run by professional directors instead of being run by founders or technology people.
574
So, it's all led to huge amounts of slowdowns and inefficiencies and all sorts of issues.
575
And there have been some famous stories of foundation coups, quote unquote, where you have these Cayman directors who just run away with the money or don't pay themselves huge salaries.
576
So, Miles Jennings is basically saying, Look, this is all a shit show.
577
Everybody knows it.
578
And we really would to just have companies just running, basically being run by founders.
579
And the new regime that's coming in through this new proposed market structure bill will propose a totally different decentralization test, which is more about these markers of control as opposed to about your corporate structuring.
580
We're not going to care in the future about who,, do you have a foundation or not, or your U.S.
581
company or not?
582
All we care about is these low site of control.
583
If you show that you do not have control, then this thing is decentralized, and therefore it's not going to be an unrestored security.
584
So, he's calling now for moving away from the foundation model and moving more towards companies and as well towards the structure known as Duna, which is this Wyoming-based DAO structure thing that was recently created in Wyoming.
585
I don't think there's been a lot of these so far, but it is right now the only real US structure that looks the thing you would want a DAO to be if you're going to have a wholesale replacement for the foundation structure, where you basically are, this is a company that is responsive entirely to the needs of a DAO.
586
So that was all a mouthful, but hopefully she gave you some picture of what people are talking about when they're talking about the end of the foundation.
587
I want to quick go around the horn and starting with you, Robert.
588
What's your thoughts on this perspective on the death of foundation?
589
I think it's possibly long overdue, but also possibly immature, right?
590
And I say that because it's obvious that the foundation model is inefficient, right?
591
You don't need multiple different vaguely competing groups with redundant, weird, complex structures to build a thing, right?
592 it just seems a waste of time.
593 I've spoken to a lot of founders who are, oh, it's going to take us this many months and we have to do this and then we have to find independent directors who know what we want, but also can operate autonomously and all of this stuff, right?
594
So it just seems a huge amount of extra steps to get to some place, right?
595
But the world hasn't really seen or done it scale any other model.
596
So to say that it's the death of the foundation seems premature to me because it's not, oh, everybody look over here.
597
This is the alternative that's working.
598
Because,, I don't think the Duna thing has been tried.
599
So it just seems premature to suggest an alternative because no one has really succeeded in alternate models yet.
600
True, what't want to do the foundation model just moved to another country historically, right?
601 a lot of people moved to Singapore, Dubai, whatever.
602
Yes, but I've,, there are some that just straight up did company, right?
603
Yeah.
604
So, I'm just.
605
I think if you're almost always, if you're sufficiently big, you do a foundation, regardless of where you're downside.
606
I guess I honestly agree with the motivations in that the foundation employees are always less motivated or whatever.
607 it's a different because it's a different set of people.
608
They maybe weren't bought into the vision of the thing.
609
They might just be hired.
610
Fine.
611
I agree.
612
I just think this Wyoming thing is a little bit also shilling your book.
613
Yeah, you made the structure, so you want people to use it.
614 I look nothing against my, it's just, yeah, I could imagine another structure in a different state under different jurisdiction that works also, right?
615 it's there is no real other structure, right?
616
This is the only thing.
617
Well, this is not a real structure either until it has tons of you proven, to Robert's point, until it's proven.
618
It's still an academic paper to me.
619
It's not a real thing.
620
And I think it's a little bit carpet for the horse to just be, yes, it's already real.
621
But I also agree, you have to will these things into existence because there's some social aspect, which is why I think it's marketing.
622
To be, it's the which honestly, you need to get these things off the ground.
623
So there's no disparagement towards marketing, but there is shilling your book.
624, let's just be honest about that.
625
To be clear, it's not literally their book because they don't make any money off people using UNAS.
626
No, no, but it's an intellectual shilling.
627
It's, it's buying academic papers.
628
Intellectually shilling your book.
629
Okay, no, no, no.
630
It's getting citations, right?
631
It's there is a sense in which this is this is a shill, but it's not a financial shill.
632
It's an influence/slash.
633
He wants to be a legal influencer and create the new structure in the way that,, what's his name?
634
Marco, who created the SAS, became an influencer, right?
635, yeah, now he's the head of a Solana microstrategy competitor, right?
636, that's what being a legal influence is a lot of people.
637
You think this is my crazy career trajectory.
638
Yeah.
639
Okay.
640
Anyway, but you get my point, right?
641
It's, it's a clout/slash importance in a certain community thing, right?
642
It's not voluntary.
643
I guess.
644
I guess.
645
Tom, you have a take?
646, I think I largely agree.
647
People don't love the foundation model.
648
I would say, yeah,, it's the reason why everyone also incorporates in Delaware.
649
It's there's very well-established case law around corporate governance, taxation, standing in the campus, moving it to Wyoming.
650
It's, I don't know anything about Wyoming lives.
651
It's most lawyers don't either.
652
Are investors going to be willing to invest into a Juna?
653
I don't know.
654
It's very much a chicken and egg problem.
655
I also think everyone hates this current foundation setup.
656
I think in part because it's offshore, this weird separate group of people who are part of the foundation.
657
But I don't think in isolation, there's anything wrong with a foundation and a for-profit entity for open source.
658, I look at something Automatic and WordPress, and there's also a WordPress foundation, right?
659
There's nothing that's okay,, I think maybe good to have something that's a nonprofit to steward something that's truly open source, but maybe it just shouldn't be obligatory, is maybe more of the point here.
660
But I don't think this means that we're going to be done with foundations forever.
661
Yeah, that's a good point.
662
I think there are very few things in crypto that are so done that they're ready for a foundation, right?
663, I think Bitcoin is maybe one of the only things.
664
And the Bitcoin Foundation was a principle of criminality, right?
665
In terms of how many people on it went to jail.
666
Oh, yeah, sure.
667
And ironically, it is the only example of foundation that has totally receded from any relevance to the underlying asset.
668
Whereas, of course, the Ethereum Foundation is, we just talked about it as being very, very central to the story of Ethereum.
669
So I think there's, I would take the other side.
670
So I understand the charge that you're levying against Miles here, Taru, but I do think.
671
It's not a charge.
672
This is the same thing I do when I write papers.
673
What's the point of giving talks at conferences?
674
No, no, no, it's not.
675
I get it.
676
I get it.
677
I get it.
678
Yes.
679
It's intellectual shilling.
680
I would describe that as intellectual entrepreneurship, which is that somebody's got to do the work of socializing,, how do we change the status quo?
681
And I think there's just not a lot of people who, one, are talking about it, and two, have the momentum, the ability to generate the momentum to shift anything.
682
I'll take the other side of this is that I think there is a little bit of an illusion that the foundation structure is really battle-tested.
683 when we say that the foundation model is battle-tested, it's, okay, well, Wyoming law, who the fuck knows?
684
No one has done a Duna.
685
I, I don't know if anyone has done a Duna, but certainly no big projects I'm aware of have done one.
686 the reality is that in what sense is the foundation model battle-tested?
687
Right?
688
What battles has it survived?
689
We've never seen a tax investigation into any of these crypto companies.
690
And so we don't know.
691
Would it survive a tax investigation of saying, okay, well,, the money's over here, this thing's over here.
692
They're paying blah, blah, blah.
693
We don't know.
694
Second, of the case of, oh, well, if a foundation is doing it, it's not a security.
695
That obviously has failed, right?
696
Fucking every single one of these assets have been securities, regardless of whether they're foundations.
697
So in what sense is the foundation model battle-tested?
698
What battles has it won that we're, oh, great, this is why you should do a foundation?
699
Now, maybe some lawyer is going to respond to me in a quote tweet and say, oh, you don't understand all these little tiny, whatever class action lawsuits we've gotten out of because we're in a foundation or a Cayman foundation.
700
But I would imagine a lot of that just because you're in a weird jurisdiction, not because you have survived some incredible legal battle.
701
So I think it is the cost that these protocols are paying for the incredible amount of inefficiency that they're incurring and the amount of costs and the amount of time wastage that happens because of coordinating across multiple companies and organizations that are run by basically bureaucrats who live in tax havens.
702 I've experienced this.
703
I've been a part of protocols that basically got into really aggressive battles with their foundations because originally everyone's on board, everything is great, and the two groups just diverge over time.
704
And as a Silicon Valley-oriented VC, the thing you learn over time is that pretty much always, if there's a dispute, the founder is probably on the right side.
705
And I've never seen an example that went the other way where the foundation was right and the founder was wrong.
706
So usually we know the right answer.
707
The community knows the right answer.
708
Yeah, I guess I'm not trying to say the foundation model is the best, but this feels a I found a new best thing and then, oh, well, okay, but if you could convince no one to do it and it hasn't happened, then, it's not really the new thing yet.
709
But to be clear,, so this is my response to a lot of stuff this, which is that the US basically just changed 10 minutes ago.
710
So there has been no time for anything to shift in a post-Gensler world.
711 Gensler was just out in January.
712
So January 19th was the last day.
713
And looking at that.
714
That's why, again, this post is marketing to convince the next Hayden Adam to do this.
715
It is marketing.
716
It is a dismissive way to describe something.
717
But it is marketing.
718
It is fundamentally content marketing.
719
And then I think maybe too, to his point, I would to see, and maybe this is in the works and we're just not privy to it, some skin in the game, the same way, okay, YC comes out the safe, and now all the YC companies are using the safe and we're attesting to this.
720
But this is how you do that, right?
721 first you socialize.
722
Yeah, yeah.
723
Let me finish.
724
Let me finish.
725
I'm saying, wait, but if they have something that's, hey, every single new company that's going through CSX or startup school, you have to create a Juna.
726
We're not going to back you.
727
You're not going to be able to go through unless you use Ajuna for your corporate entity.
728
Great.
729
Now there's actual skin in the game, incentive alignment.
730
They're coercing your portfolio companies to do this.
731
I think that's the coerce your portfolio companies to all be Delaware C Corps, right?
732
Every single company.
733
Oh, I don't.
734
Okay, fine.
735
Most investors generally require,, when it's a company, it's for it to be a C Corp, not for it to be some LLC or some partnership.
736
If it is, you say, oh, that's super weird.
737
You have to conform to this venture model, right?
738, this is the way it works.
739
So it's a you think that the only way to do this is not marketing is for ASICs and Z to say, we will not invest in you unless you create a Duna.
740
No, no, no, no.
741
I'm talking about CSX or startup school, where it's pre-entity formation.
742
If you're coming over here and you want to be in this program, when you're forming your entity, you have to use a Duna.
743
You can't get in unless you're using Duna.
744
Obviously, if you're doing a Series C, it can't be,, no more Delaware C courts.
745
That would be absurd.
746
But the idea is, hey, at the top of the funnel, we can have an impact.
747
That seems very feasible in my mind.
748
And I think the marketing is a way to soften the blow for those first founders who are going to have to deal with all the regulatory, whatever, bullshit.
749
I think if you want to do that, so I don't know that I agree.
750
It's not up to, what should I say?
751
A6 and Z is such a big brand in the space that if they mandate something, they are more or less coercing a lot of people to do what it takes in order to get in.
752
If YC said we are no longer investing in safes that have discounts, no more discounts on safes fucking ever, they are so big and so powerful that they're effectively coercing a bunch of people who don't have the power to say no to YC.
753
I think if you are A6 and Z, that's the wrong way to do it.
754
The right way to do it is to socialize the idea, to shift the Overton window, get a bunch of lawyers who are famously, extremely risk averse, and who every fucking lawyer I've ever talked to about is, oh, foundation model, it's so battle-tested.
755
Dunas, they've never had it.
756
And I'm, what the fuck are you talking about?
757
How?
758
All we do in crypto is get sued.
759, all we do is fucking, we're an industry that has constantly been on the back foot with respect to legal.
760
So the idea that, well, we've, we've obviously figured out the holy grail, which is the foundation model, is crazy.
761
But you have to get lawyers to say yes to that, right?
762 each one of these companies that goes through CSX, they're already incorporated.
763
Yeah.
764
But the reason I think, again, is the market signal of safes and safts is that people fucking use them.
765
And end of the day, they didn't have to shift the majority.
766
They did not even have to do that much marketing.
767
The SAFT from zero to usage, amazingly fast.
768
Token warrants, same thing.
769
And so I think if you token warrants were not amazingly fast, it took relatively compared to how long have you been hearing about Dunas?
770
I've been hearing about Duna's for two and a half years.
771
I've been hearing about so many DAOs saying they're going to convert and then don't do it.
772
Because no one wants to deal with overhead.
773
The warrant innovation was pulled through the demand of all investors.
774
All investors said, holy shit, this is genuinely better.
775
Therefore, everyone should be using this.
776
And it wasn't leverage against the company.
777
It was, no, this is a better model to structure tokens.
778
And it won very quickly, just safes won versus convertible notes very quickly once the market realized what they were.
779
Right?
780
So to Trin's point, warrants are a good structure.
781
And they literally went zero to one very fast because they were superior.
782
Dunas have not gone zero to one, even though the idea has been socialized for some time.
783
But the reason why the Duna has not won is because America was not the right place to do any of this until January.
784
So, how could, why would anybody ever do a Duna in 2019?
785, you'd be out of your fucking mind.
786
Everybody was doing all these gymnastics to try to claim that.
787
Totally, totally, totally.
788
So maybe the next step is there should be projects to do the Duna.
789
And we all have to be clear.
790
I literally have maybe Dunas have all sorts of problems.
791
Haseeb is telling you, if you're a founder listening, Haseeb is telling you he wants you.
792
He's more likely to invest in you if you do a Duna.
793
Haseb is explicitly saying that is what I, what?
794
Dragonfly from now on the list.
795
I'll not see all invest in whatever.
796
It just is C-balling will only do this.
797
Yeah, Haseibata.
798
I will vote no in SE if you go to a Duna.
799
Dude, Tom, Tom going in for the kill.
800
That was, that was amazing.
801
Yeah, there you go.
802
Nice.
803
Look, the reason why, here's the reason why I think I'm triggered by your reaction to this, Tarun, and a little bit, Robert, is this the same reaction that I've gotten, obviously in a totally different domain, talking about market making disclosures, talking about changing the way that we do token investing and,, staking disclosures about whether tokens can be staked by investors, is that there's just a just general distrust of this shifting the Overton window and assuming that the status quo is de facto okay.
804
And there's so many things that we constantly complain about that are broken in crypto.
805
And then somebody comes out with a proposal of, hey, he's the fucking, he's the head of policy at ACCZ.
806
He knows what he's talking about.
807
I will counter your examples though, because those are material economic things where I can measure some notion of harm or gain very easily with those disclosures.
808
How can you measure the notion of harm or gain in market making?
809
Because I know the historical bad incidents and I can use those as well.
810
I know the historical bad incidents of foundations.
811
Foundations are fucking terrible.
812
Yes, but the problem is Duna doesn't give you an obvious number of loss that could have been protected.
813
There's no headline, hey, you would have by spending this much money in the state of Wyoming, you will save this much money in the future.
814
There's no simple sales pitch.
815 the sales pitch is some fucking 5,000 word essay.
816
That's not a good that the market doesn't it.
817
Do we even know the cost of foundations though?
818 let me go back to this see if you're I know the cost to me.
819
It costs a lot of money.
820
Right.
821
There's the dollar cost, but again, a doona or any other structure also costs money.
822
I view the cost as a communication inefficiency and a development inefficiency and a weird fragmentation of leadership as a weird meta cost, not a dollar,, oh, it costs talking about the Ethereum Foundation having this fucking decentralized morass that they were stuck in.
823
And, oh, it's great that it's hierarchical now.
824
Yeah, but other foundations had the hierarchy immediately.
825, if I, if you look at all the sift tongues from 2017, you're telling me that that's an Ethereum-specific thing.
826
That's not, oh, foundation forced you into that.
827
I think just to be clear, I think Miles is very smart.
828
I think Andrewson's great.
829
I think my point was more around,, you're in the hot dog costume and you're pointing around the room wondering who did this.
830,, it's you have the agency.
831
You can make them do that.
832, in your scenario, if you were a market maker and you're, we need market maker disclosures, you're, great, why don't you start?
833
You can do it tomorrow.
834
Versus,, being someone who's a participant, but, it's not really.
835
I disagree.
836
So if Guinea has been on the show saying that market makers, he would love a market maker disclosure regime, but he's not going to be the only one to do it.
837
Right.
838
He's, I'm not going to disagree.
839
No one's going to start.
840
Well, yeah, his point is, look, if everybody mandates it, or if all the big market makers come together and agree, then I'm happy to do it and I'm happy to even instigate it.
841
But I will definitely not be the only one making disclosures because then no one's going to fucking work with me because nobody wants to be, oh, again, again, clear.
842
Again, there's a clear economic thing to the market maker disclosure thing, whereas the Duna is nebulous governance shit.
843
You can't attribute one line item by line item to Robert's point.
844
Oh, this is the cost benefit of it.
845
It just seems, yes, it's cool.
846
Robert is literally, he's the only person that's set up a foundation.
847
So Robert knows the line items.
848
Yeah.
849
No, I've never done a foundation.
850
Wait, so combat doesn't have a foundation?
851
No.
852
Oh, okay.
853
Sorry.
854
I thought it didn't.
855
No.
856
Incorrect information.
857
Okay.
858
No, I've never done a foundation.
859
Again, it's a lot of stuff that was.
860
Yeah.
861
I just think the benefits of Duna are just not really that clear.
862
Or they're abstract and nebulous, and people are, what can I do quickly to launch my token?
863
And it doesn't seem it's.
864
Which is, to Tom's point, why you need to force people into it.
865
Is a foundation a fast way to launch a token?
866, what are you talking about?
867
You're an investor in crypto protocol.
868
Has anyone ever told you?
869
It's so, oh man, I set up my foundation.
870
You're, you've done legal Zoom and you fill out the dollars.
871
It's fast from the perspective of a founder because they can find a lawyer at Goodwin or Fenwick or somewhere that is, I will do this.
872
I'm the only founder I've ever spoken to about foundations.
873
I think it's so much more standardized than a Duna.
874
Okay, go find me someone.
875
Yes, because nobody has done Duna.
876
So obviously it's not standardized.
877
But this gets back to the point of if you have a chicken and the egg problem.
878
If you cannot convince people to do it, you either have to force them, Tom said, to get your example data points, or you have to have a clear value prop that is measured in dollars.
879
Did you do not have that?
880
Did you read the post?
881
Yes.
882
Did you read the post?
883
Yes.
884
I don't think it does not have to do it.
885
No, it's written for fucking lawyers.
886
It's not written for founders.
887
You read that as a founder,, great.
888
So I'm going to innovate on corporate structure, and maybe my cost might be unboundedly high because, oh, I'm going to be the first chicken to get tested.
889
Why would I do this?
890
Oh, it saves me X thousand dollars per month, per employee, per year, whatever.
891
Okay, then it's okay.
892
I get it.
893
But it's written purely to be lawyer porn, which is why it's academic shilling.
894
It's not real shilling, but it's still marketing.
895
It's just a different type of porn.
896
What's real shilling?
897
Real chilling is when Dragonfly invests in a Duna-based project.
898
Yes.
899
And then it talks about on Twitter and on the chopping block why this structure is superior.
900
If you are doing a Duna, I want to hear from you.
901
Hand us up.
902
I won't necessarily invest, but I want to know what the experience was.
903
And we'll bring it up next time on the show.
904
I think we need a token to solve this collective action problem.
905
I think that's really dollar sign, Duna.
906
Dollar sign, Duna, Dollar Sign, Duna.
907, it has a ticker already.
908
Yeah.
909
Yeah.
910
Miles could make the token in a Duna.
911
Oh, he hates meme coins.
912
We need a meme coin.
913
This is not a meme coin.
914
This is a consensus coin.
915
We are building an ideological consensus around a new legal structure.
916
So, okay.
917
I love that this is the thing that we got most heated on was about legal structuring.
918
We will probably not come back on this because I imagine we lost all of our audience in this debate.
919
No, we have so many lawyers in the lawyers listen.
920
I feel they probably the lawyers you talk to will always tell you they get pitched all this duna stuff and then they have customers who are customers being founders who are ah too much I don't want to think about it and I think they're to be clear okay I here's okay I'll I'll give one last point and then Trune you can have the last word I think this is ultimately how you shift consensus on anything, right?
921
Nobody is going to do market-making disclosures until somebody convinces you that doing market-making disclosures is cool and that you're not going to be weird.
922
Investors are not going to raise their eyebrows.
923
Retail is not going to get freaked out if they see all the things disclosed, right?
924
The only way you're going to shift that is by somebody doing the entrepreneurial work of building a different social consensus and making people even think about this, right?
925
This is not,, the reason why we shifted from SAFTs to warrants was purely for tax reasons.
926
And it's tax reasons.
927
Again, economic benefit that is clear.
928
Economic benefit.
929
That is not there to the investor, to the investor, to the investor.
930
But something that's beneficial to the project is much more inscrutable to the investor.
931
The investor has to really think hard and has to understand legal ramifications.
932
They don't have to think hard at all to understand the difference between a SAFT and a warrant because it works for them either way.
933
They don't need to understand the underlying legal reality.
934
But for the difference between a Duna and a fucking foundation, they do.
935
Now, I'm not a lawyer.
936
I'm not an expert on any of this.
937
But as somebody who's been investing in crypto for almost a decade, I have seen all of the pain that has been incurred by foundations.
938
Maybe we hear from some guy who's done a Duna and they're, guess what?
939
I had the exact same pain.
940
It was just a different form of pain.
941
In which case, great.
942
That's worth learning.
943
But the foundation structure is so bad.
944
It's so obviously stupid.
945
It obviously goes against everything you would think of about how to create effective products or effective organizations that the sooner that we can replace it with something else, the better.
946
If this is the way forward, fucking sign me up.
947
All I have is that I don't know what it is.
948
Miles, good job on the marketing because you got us to waste 20 minutes.
949
The shilling.
950
The shilling.
951
Clearly worked as marketing, right?
952
We talked about it.
953
Now, a bunch of people who never heard the fucking acronym Duna, since we're on the acronym kick, now have heard it.
954
And I think this talking is basically trying to will into existence, which is fine.
955
That's great.
956
That's great.
957
I'm not, that's not what I'm disagreeing with.
958
I'm just saying,, yeah, but it isn't really on the foundation until I see that this thing works.
959
And to Tom's point, the cold start problem hasn't been solved, right?
960, you've written a paper, you haven't made the shipped.
961
That's what this means.
962
Maybe Duna should be the Ethereum acronym.
963, we change other censorship for no censorship.
964
Decentralized US.
965
The A is and scalability.
966
All of a sudden, everybody will be doing a Duna.
967
No, no, no.
968
The A should be acceleration because then they compete with acceleration is good.
969
That's a good one.
970
That's a good one.
971
Decentralized user network acceleration.
972
All right.
973
So there's two options.
974
Either one, create Duna is now the Ethereum acronym or two, launch a Duna and tell us about it.
975
So that's your as the audience, that is your if you launch a Duna that gets off the ground and you get to a you hire more than five employees, we will have you as a guest on the chopping block.
976
I don't we get hold of it.
977
I do not agree to that.
978
I do not agree to that.
979
But Tarun, but Tarun will interview you.
980
Tarun will interview you.
981
We got to wrap.
982
Thanks, everybody.
983
And we've got my favorite.
