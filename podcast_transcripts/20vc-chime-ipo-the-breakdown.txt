1
Suddenly we've drifted into some kind of theft of trade properties and suddenly someone opens an investigation.
2
Then you're fucked.
3
If I was my ass was on the line and I was the CEO of Deal, I'd be like, how much money does it take to settle this thing by Friday?
4
A fund returner is not enough, man.
5
We don't get out of bed for a fund returner.
6
A fund returner just returns the fund.
7
Like everyone talks in venture about fund returners like they're so great.
8
I don't think they're so great.
9
One of the depressing facts about venture is we make an embarrassingly large percentage of our money once every seven years when you're in the white heat of must acquire, must own, high-growth venture assets.
10
You are listening to 20 VC with me, Harry Stebbings.
11
Now, this is my favorite show of the week.
12
We are back, Rory O'Driscoll, Jason Lampkin, and me discussing the hottest topics of today.
13
What is on the cards today?
14
We have Chimes IPO.
15
We have Venture X's and their value increasing exponentially.
16
What that means for LPs, what that means for GPs, and so much more.
17
I love doing this show.
18
Let me know what you think.
19
You can find me on Twitter at Harry Stebbings.
20
I want to know how we can make it better for you.
21
But before we dive in today, here are two fun facts about our newest brand sponsor, Kajabi.
22

23
Wow.
24
Second, Kajabi's users keep 100% of their earnings, with the average Kajabi creator bringing in over $30,000 per year.

29
And once you've found the next great startup, you're gonna need the tools to help them scale.
30
That's why AWS is the perfect partner for startups and why they're proud to sponsor this week's episode of 20 VC.
31
The AWS startups team comprises former founders and CTOs, venture capitalists, angel investors, and mentors ready to help you prove what's possible.

43
Now let's switch gears from cloud innovation to the future of mobile and how one company is turning your screen into real returns.
44
We spend nearly half our waking hours glued to our phones, upwards of 50 hours every week.
45
Recently, one company transforming this reality stood out so much I personally became a shareholder, Mode Mobile.
46
Mode Mobile created the earn phone, the smartphone that pays you for daily activities.
47
Instead of big tech profiting billions from our attention, Mode returns over $325 million directly to users through earnings and savings.
48
Mode's revenues surge in three years, recognized by Deloitte as 2023's fastest-growing software company in North America.
49
And here's why I'm excited: Mode's equity offerings have raised over $30 million from 20,000-plus retail investors, one of 2025's standout public raises.
50
And you can now join me as a shareholder with as little as $1,000 at invest.modemobile.com forward slash 20 VC.

53
You have now arrived at your destination.
54
Chaps, it is the highlight of my week.
55
Everyone, my mother listens to this show and she's like, I can visibly tell your tone is more excited.
56
You should like change that.
57
And I was like, I think we're passed that after this amount of time, Jules.
58
This is good news, guys.
59
IPOs, baby.
60
This is liquidity.
61
Thank Lord.
62
So QIIME announced, well, dropped their S1.
63
I thought it was super interesting.
64
8.6 million active users.
65
This one astounded me.
66
Two-thirds of users have Chime as a primary account.
67
Two-thirds.
68
That's amazing in my eyes.
69
1.67 billion 2024 revenues.
70
Why are they IPOing now, right?
71
Unless you have inside information, that's to me, that's the number one question.
72
Despite the craziness of the last month and a half, we're only 3% off our all-time high.
73
This has been the weirdest market ever.
74
You know, we were doing great.
75
Then we, you know, plummeted a little bit in March, but really in April.
76
But we've bounced, this is the fastest bounce back in the last 20 or 30 years.
77
So we're within spitting distance of our all-time high and up on the year.
78
So what it says is, two months ago, it's like, oh, everything's doomed.
79
I'll say a month ago, everything was doomed, now everything's back.
80
What it just shows is when policy changes that quickly, you really can't triangulate on that.
81
I think they were smart.
82
They had their S1 and file.
83
And what they said is, oh, somewhere between we filed privately and today, weird shit happened, but it appears to be over.
84
Proceed as normal.
85
I think they're exactly right.
86
Is that in today's market?
87
I mean, it's one of the weirdest statements ever.
88
In today's market, you'll clearly get this done.
89
In February's market, you'll clearly get this done.
90
Oh, and in between for about a month, things went to hell in a handbasket.
91
But moving right along, nothing to see here now.
92
So that's why they dropped it.
93
I think they get points for being shrewd, keeping it on file, keeping it updated.
94
And now, you know, in this market, they're ready to roll.
95
And I think it's a great company.
96
Look, it's clearly going to get done.
97
It's a $1.7 billion trailing revenue company, growing 30%.
98
We'll talk about valuation in a second.
99
It basically comes off two big ideas.
100
The first is that in the world of the internet, you can give people a bank account so cost-effectively that you can offer a very different product than the large U.S.
101
banks.
102
You don't have to ding them on overdraft fees.
103
You don't have to nickel and dime them on kind of monthly fees.
104
You can make all your money on transaction, pretty much 75% of your money on basically debit card fees, which is a relatively small part of most banking revenue streams.
105
It's a great idea.
106
And the reason it works is duh, the internet.
107
No branches, no people in branches.
108
You know, they make $250 per client per year, and they can build a profitable business on that.
109
I don't think a JP Morgan or a Chase would be.
110
And they can add over the next few years, they're going to add, you know, loans, which they don't really do a lot of today, and all the other cross-sell stuff that every financial services company does at scale.
111
So you can look one way and say, you know, there's a whole bunch of upside from here, because if you're making $250 off a customer today, even if that's a middle-income customer with sub 100K revenue, they're going to have other financial needs and you're going to be able to sell to them.
112
That's the upside story.
113
It is worth pointing out the minor negative on the story is a huge amount of this is Durban Amendment arbitrage, which is a very arcane rule that really matters.
114
In I think 09, after the great financial crash, they were putting through a re-regulation package.
115
And there's a rule that says if you are a bank more than $10 billion in assets, you can only charge approximately, the devil's in the details, but approximately 50 bips on a debit card.
116
If you are a sub-10 billion dollar bank, you can charge more, and the effective rate is typically about 1.2%.
117
So you get more transactions.
118
When two people go into the same shop and buy something on a debit card, if one's from JP Morgan, the firm has to pay 50, the shop has to pay 50 bips.
119
And if the other is from LittleBank.co, they all have to pay 1.2%.
120
The economics of a debit card business to a small bank are much more compelling.
121
CHIME itself is not a bank, but they cleverly, obviously, team with a lot of these small, sub-10 billion dollar deposit banks.
122
And as a result of that, their revenue stream, which is 75% of their total money, comes from a product where they have this umbrella effect from that legislation.
123
Obviously, if that were to change, you wake up every morning spitting mad that these dudes are able to take your customers because you're not allowed to charge what they can charge for exactly the same product.
124
I mean, that's the only minor negative in the thing.
125
Otherwise, it's a great company.
126
It's growing nicely, 30% plus.
127
They've executed on a very consistent plan for 10 or 12 years.
128
And you kind of go team.
129
We can talk valuation in a second, but like the company a lot, wish we did the round we looked at.
130
And all congrats to them.
131
What round did you look at?
132
Oh, way back, way back.
133
I can't even remember.
134
It was like, I heard that you wanted to do it, but your partners didn't.
135
You were all in, and they were like, no, but you were yes.
136
Partnerships stick together, Harry.
137
I love those tweets.
138
I would be a billionaire, but I couldn't get it past my investment committee.
139
But I was all in.
140
I was all in on the deal.
141
And the founders wanted me, right?
142
We already had a handshake deal, but.
143
Let's move on from that.
144
It's not that interesting.
145
Let's talk about valuation, which is more interesting.
146
Yeah, I agree.
147
Well, hold on.
148
Not to interrupt, Harry, it's your show.
149
But if it's not interesting, I think it's interesting.
150
If it's not interesting that Chime's IPOing, then shouldn't everyone chime or better IPO now?
151
Because we've talked about the incentives to not IPO, right, for founders to do infinite secondaries and do it.
152
But if the markets are wide open, Figma's out, Chime's out.
153
Is it time for folks to grow up?
154
Should everybody IPO now?
155
And will they?
156
Because I'll tell you.
157
I'm going to override you because I didn't say, I said talking about internals, decisions on deals, not deals wasn't interesting.
158
I actually think I'm going to hold your question because I actually think the natural order of it is we should talk a little bit about the valuation, which will segue us perfectly.
159
The last private round these guys did was at $25 billion.
160
Information estimates of a valuation of seven or eight billion.
161
I think that's low.
162
But I think if you end up plus or minus 10 billion, you know, rough order of magnitude here, you are looking at a deal going public, you know, 50, 55% below the last round price.
163
That's just a fact.
164
And you have to talk about what does that mean?
165
How does that work for the specific company?
166
And then what does it mean, Jason, to your point, for other companies going public?
167
Can I ask a question here?
168
Because I'm just ignorant.
169
So, okay, if Sequoia Capital Global Equities, which I don't think is the early stage fund at Sequoia based on the title, right?
170
But if they did the round at 25 billion, is this a huge loss for Sequoia?
171
Is it like an SBV or separate entity?
172
Is it a small piece of the fund?
173
Or if it goes out at 10 billion, which is epic in absolute terms, right?
174
But Sequoia did it at 25.
175
What is that?
176
Maybe Harry knows too, but I honestly don't know.
177
What does that mean at the fund level?
178
Well, just to be clear, besides not being a win, I actually interviewed Jeff Wang.
179
He was the head of it, and he's left now.
180
But essentially, it's a lot of people.
181
He left.
182
Well, he left a while ago.
183
Because it's such a great job?
184
It was such a great job.
185
He'd be there today.
186
A bunch of young people.
187
I love Jeff.
188
But essentially, it's their super late-stage borderline pre-IPO/slash-post-IPO.
189
Generally speaking, honestly, they've done phenomenally well, but it's a completely separate vehicle run by a separate team.
190
This is the question that I was interested in, so I have more detail.
191
It boils down to only one issue: what are the terms of the mandatory conversion of the autos of incorporation?
192
In other words, this is we sometimes reference the fact that in an MA, even if you quote, overpay, and if this company sold.
193
The question is, what's the equivalent term to that in an IPO?
194
And there is an equivalent term.
195
It's the mandatory conversion term.
196
It boils down to the following question.
197
In a quote, qualifying IPO, which is the IPO above a certain size and scale, which of course this will be, is there price protection for the $25 billion round such that the price adjusts down either fully or partially to the IPO price or not?
198
Is that term in there or not?
199
I went to the S1.
200
It wasn't clear, but you can actually get the articles of incorporation, which is where it will be.
201
I ran out of time.
202
I'm actually very interested in that, because if you think about this late-stage business, there's only one thing that can go wrong in a late-stage company.
203
Probably 99% of them won't blow up.
204
And the only risk you're running is the risk that you overpay.
205
And if you can negotiate a term that effectively says, hey, dude, if I overpay, you've got to give me more shares such that I didn't overpay, then it's the world's best business.
206
There's only one thing that you can go wrong, and now it can't go wrong anymore.
207
So it would be really interesting to see, did these guys, you know, on this deal, and just in general, Jason, to your wider point on all these deals, what are the terms of the late-stage company, later stage rounds in terms of IPO protections and blocking rights?
208
So the one thing I do know is I know the General Atlantic team very well who also were part of this round.
209
Yeah, they also took part in the Sheehan round and landed at $100 billion.
210
And I know that they are incredibly diligent around putting those protections in place in the case of a mispricing happening, like a Sheehan, which is not hitting the $100 billion price that it was paid.
211
And yes, and we'll find out, because before.
212
Then, as part of the S1, they're going to have to disclose the adjustment, quantify the adjustment.
213
It'll all be there at the end.
214
The great thing about S1s and going public is all the facts come out because otherwise the CFO goes to prison.
215
And we'll know exactly how many shares get issued.
216
And look, if these guys have full protection, then that's a win.
217
And an interesting lesson for the founder, you didn't raise money at $25 billion.
218
You thought you raised money at $25 billion.
219
But in fact, if you go public at 12, you raised money at 12 and you just didn't know it.
220
The more I listen, the more I just think Jason's right that seed is for suckers.
221
You can overpay by double and still get your one ass protected with a shortened time to liquidity and more money at work.
222
Seed is for suckers.
223
Well, you know, not only is it for suckers, but I know like a lot of seed folks that have all these great opinions and how safes are terrible and everything's terrible.
224
I don't think ratchets for a late stage deal are such a bad deal.
225
I don't think it's a big deal.
226
Listen, obviously, if you're an early stage investor before that, you'd prefer there not be a ratchet or an adjustment.
227
Let's be like, we can't argue with that.
228
But if you need the money and you're split, people get too emotional.
229
You're splitting the difference.
230
Okay, so Sequoia and SoftBank and Tiger and Dragon are coming at 25 billion.
231
If you're worth north of 25, you win, right?
232
You won the bet.
233
You won the bet.
234
If Chime ends up at 10, and let's say it's a full ratchet and they're ratcheted down to 10 billion, but maybe they probably only bought 3% of the company.
235
So you have 3% dilution because you lost the bet, but you still won the bet because you got the money.
236
I don't know why people get so emotional about these ratchets.
237
And I get why they're toxic early stage, but these are just seed investors who are grumpy that seed's a sucker bet, including me.
238
But I'm not grumpy about it anymore.
239
I just sign the documents.
240
I don't even read them anymore because it don't matter what's in them.
241
I just sign them and it doesn't.
242
Is that you know, I've been through the drama of one of these, you know, we gave a late-stage ratchet, and then you're pricing the IPO, and then everything all gets bent out of shape.
243
And I can't remember, there was one IPO recently that had one where, you know, people were writing the oh my god, they have to go public because of the ratchet.
244
Service titanium-titan.
245
And I ran the numbers.
246
The truth is, Jason's exactly right.
247
You gave away 3% of the company in around, let's just say you were wrong by 50%, so you gave away six, not three.
248
It sucks.
249
I'd prefer to have 100% of my position, not 97% of my position.
250
But it's not the end of the world.
251
It's an economic term.
252
It's not an emotional thing.
253
Provided it's not out of control, it's survivable.
254
Now, as I say, it does mean that on the other side of the table, they have a wildly attractive business because we've just agreed.
255
They get lick preference and MA.
256
They get full price protection in an IPO.
257
And by the way, it's priced at the IPO price.
258
So the IPO pop puts them back up 30% the same day.
259
That's the, by the way, a little comment.
260
It doesn't matter, but that's the little bit that will rub you as the CEO.
261
Let me get this straight.
262
They paid $25 billion.
263
It's been marked down to $10 billion.
264
So I'm giving them an extra 3%.
265
And then when my share opens in two hours' time and it pops 30%, they're going to be up 30% on that recorrected price.
266
Whoa, that sucks.
267
For sure.
268
But they made this investment in 2021.
269
What's the IRR on this deal?
270
Not so great, right?
271
Agreed.
272
That's the point.
273
A full ratchet.
274
Like, we get so religious.
275
Even if they get a 30% pop and they distribute by 2027, that's six years to having a modest return, right?
276
No, you're exactly right.
277
Totally agree.
278
The risk you're running on these kinds of transactions is primarily IRR risk, not loser capital risk.
279
In the business you're in, you know, you have a substantial risk of loss of capital.
280
My guess is, yeah, see.
281
At the stage these guys are at, most of their deals, 90% plus of their deals, when you're writing those kinds of checks, should be a 1X plus IPO pop.
282
They're not running the getting it all wrong risk.
283
What they are running, to your point, Jason, is the, oh my God, we were four years too early and our IRR is going to be pitiful.
284
When do you think you transition to an IRR risk game?
285
For us, we don't play the IRR risk game, really, so to speak, I don't think.
286
When does that become crucial?
287
I mean, it's hard to answer that question.
288
I think there's a size.
289
I remember realizing when you watch the late-stage hedge fund guys come in that they fundamentally run their entire life on IRR.
290
They have, you know, yearly, high-watermarks, compensation schemes.
291
Therefore, they're competing for a deal and they're not saying to themselves, I need a 2X or a 3X.
292
They literally use different language.
293
They say, I want to return a 30% a year.
294
You definitely see that on the late stage, on the hedge fund guys crossing over.
295
And then, so it's probably at those kind of three or four years before the IPO when it's that kind of money, when the alternative use of your capital is public stocks, baby.
296
When we look at this price that it could go out at being significantly lower, that we all said, going to Jason's question, does this mean that everyone should IPO?
297
Now's the time, if markets are receptive, bite the bullet and go.
298
I think more people should.
299
I mean, it's worth pointing out: this is still a $1.7 billion revenue company.
300
It'll probably be larger than 80% of the companies that are, you know, unicorns that have been, maybe 90% of the companies that have been talked about for IPO.
301
So it's not like this is a mid-tier marginal play.
302
This is a top-of-the-line revenue scale company.
303
I'm not going back to this and saying I have a company doing 200 million in revenue.
304
I think there's a bunch of other later stage companies who now clearly have, at the very minimum, a choice.
305
I could easily go public.
306
Do I want to or not?
307
And that set of decisions is, let's call them the billion-plus revenue guys, right?
308
Interestingly, some of them, even if the window's open, are choosing not to.
309
There is the SpaceX, the Stripes, the Lily, not what we're doing right now.
310
Thank you very much.
311
And then there's others, Klarna, another example at that scale, where I think they are saying, let's push for the line and get the capital and go for it.
312
Oddly enough, both decisions make sense.
313
If you're a Klarna, if you're a financial player where access to capital is really important, you know, you are fundamentally a lender.
314
I think being public and having access to money in all its different ways makes sense.
315
If you're a high-growth AI company or something like Stripe, you have infinite private capital at dirt cheap rates.
316
Why would you bother?
317
Is that not fundamentally it, respectfully?
318
Your Klarners and your Chimes of the World, respectfully, cannot raise infinite amounts of capital at good terms from the private markets.
319
Stripe, Databricks, Anthropic, OpenAI can.
320
That's why those go public and the others don't.
321
Yeah, I mean, Klarna just said their growth substantially decelerated.
322
They just published their numbers, right?
323
No, my partner Paul did an analysis on it.
324
It's 13%.
325
He's a phenomenal analyst.
326
13% growth.
327
The cost of borrowing is way up.
328
If Klarna was doing well, and broadly speaking, I think it is doing well, they should go public much sooner than OpenAI or Stripe, because I just think they need to have access to continuous capital.
329
They're a lender at scale.
330
You know, they're not a cash flow machine.
331
They just probably have more financing alternatives as a public company.
332
I think it's more appropriate for financial services companies like that.
333
There is more cheaper capital available to, even if Klarna were, let's say, going at 20% like QIIME or 26% like QIIME, there are more options for cheap private capital if you've got the sex appeal of OpenAI than if you don't have the sex appeal of, you know, what is, you know, buy now, pay later.
334
One of them just has more intrinsic ability to raise cheap private capital.
335
I think the interesting thing to Jason's point is most companies are more like Klarna than OpenAI.
336
You know, no surprise.
337
Most companies aren't singularities.
338
And I do think as the window opens, you will see the people doing a billion in revenue, then a half or three quarters of a billion in revenue, and half a billion in revenue, thinking, maybe I should do this.
339
And every one of them is going to have to wrestle with their version of did I give away price protection?
340
Did I raise it a high price?
341
Am I willing to take that kind of hit in the public markets?
342
But I think if the window stays open, I think more of them will start to investigate this and should.
343
Listen, you've said this a million times, Harry.
344
To me, it was just, I was at EF's demo day a couple weeks back in the U.S., and I saw one of my LPs there who had retired, but one of the best foundation, like, you know, all the LPs.
345
I don't, okay.
346
I have the same LP since inception, never added one, don't plan to, okay?
347
But this guy's legendary in the industry, okay?
348
And he just retired.
349
So he had no axe to grind, right?
350
Or no game to, he's like, and he went through all my portfolio and others.
351
He's like, these guys just got to sell or go IPO.
352
It's just time.
353
So, and this is someone who pioneered a lot of this going long, doesn't, you know.
354
So when I feel that vibe check, I think it's got to water down or cascade down to the GPs, which has got to cascade down to the portfolio companies of should I keep rolling the dice on anything sub-open AI or not.
355
And so if the LPs are saying that for a variety of reasons, right, then the GPs.
356
And it may be subtle, but when I hear that from like one of the top 10 LPs of all time, that may push the pressure at IPO too.
357
It may trickle down to the CEOs.
358
I mean, he's about to tell me that my question is stupid, Jason, so he's going to reshape it in a minute.
359
But he said that like a seller IPO.
360
Well, Tomobravo is saying, well, Orlando Bravo is saying, a cold, quiet year for M<unk>A.
361
And then we're looking at also like Convergence, a company that's less than a year old in London, selling for nine figures to Salesforce and seeing more and more M<unk>A.
362
I'm just confused.
363
How do you guys think about those two opposing truths?
364
People's prognostications of what's going to happen in the future are pretty worthless, including mine, to be clear.
365
All you can say is what is happening right now.
366
What's happening right now is Salesforce bought a small, interesting AI company because they want to be an AI.
367
DAW.
368
No surprise.
369
There'll be a whole ton of these over the next two to three years as these large software companies listen to Jason telling them they're screwed on this podcast and decide, I don't want to be screwed.
370
I want to be a contender.
371
And the best way to be a contender is to pick up some of these small acquisitions and fit them into your product.
372
So that's clearly a trend that is happening.
373
So a fact-based statement, you know, much bigger one move works, and it'll probably continue to happen.
374
Totally separate trend.
375
What are Tomobrav and people like that making of software roll-ups?
376
And are they going to buy a whole bunch of venture-backed portfolio companies?
377
And as you know, we've talked about this before.
378
I don't think they are.
379
I think they've got a fair amount of indigestion from the stuff they already have.
380
And I don't think the companies that venture makes are naturally great candidate for PE purchase as much as people think.
381
So his statement could be correct too.
382
Yeah, I'll say that the P-bummer still hangs over all of this, this cloud, that he doesn't want to buy all.
383
On this convergence thing, I'll tell you my view of what he said, this is from my tiny lens, right?
384
I've had two portfolio companies recently that got offers to buy them at 500 million.
385
Okay, now in isolation, that sounds great, but these are very good companies.
386
Okay, this is not open AI.
387
These are very good companies.
388
One was just a smidge above the last round and one was a smidge below the last round.
389
And what I mean from the Orlando thing is, listen, this sounds good, but these are tech leaders who want to make AI-adjacent deals, okay?
390
But they don't care about, they're not willing to go all in, okay?
391
Now, maybe in six months, those deals would be a billion, and they both would have cleared at a billion, but they both said no.
392
And the companies just walked, and one of them bought a company instead for just under 100 million because it was just easier.
393
Instead, they bought someone at 2 million for 100 million.
394
Great deal for the founders, right?
395
Raised a seed round, but they walked from buying a leader because 500 was the limit, right?
396
And they're all could afford infinity, right?
397
In this case, for all intents and purposes.
398
So I wasn't shocked, but I was like, you know, I'm just watching the sign of the time.
399
But usually that accelerates, right?
400
We're in typical phase transitions.
401
Were these acquirers, were they PE-backed companies?
402
No, big tech leaders offered to buy two different companies for $500 million.
403
Convergent evolution here, same number, but one was just above the last round, right?
404
A little profit.
405
The other, they didn't care about the last round.
406
And it was walker, you know, hell or hot.
407
We don't care.
408
And then they bought a much smaller competitor and lost, well, lose years due to it, right?
409
But they didn't step up in the way I would expect.
410
Not that they have to.
411
It was just a sign for us all to make money in NAND.
412
You need folks really stepping up in these deals, right?
413
They're like, oh, Rory did the last deal at $700.
414
I'm going to pay 2.1.
415
That's the way venture works.
416
If that don't happen, like, I think.
417
The truth is, this: there's times in the market where the euphoria takes off and people are willing to lean in.
418
And then there's times when the other side feels it has leverage and doesn't want to do it as much.
419
And right now, look, in a few cases, like Wiz, I think they created all the leverage.
420
They played it perfectly.
421
And then the other side did what they needed to do.
422
They paid the big step up from the last round.
423
I think in a lot of cases, look, all these people read the same press we read.
424
They're saying, venture guys, it's a little bit tough.
425
No one's had liquidity.
426
And they're probably in the mode of I don't need to overpay.
427
The only thing that changes that is if some of the companies that buy and buy successfully have success with those acquisitions, if you wait two years from now, you're competing with ServiceNow and the MoveWork acquisition is killing it, and you're now second or third in the space, I don't know who that would be, would it be Zendex or whomever, then by God, you're going to do what you have to do, right?
428
You're exactly right.
429
One of the depressing facts about venture is we make an embarrassingly large percentage of our money once every seven years when you're in the white heat of must-acquire, must-own, high-growth venture assets.
430
And the trick in the other six years is surviving and keeping all the little companies alive and growing nicely so that when that moment comes, you have inventory to sell.
431
That's probably not this year.
432
Yeah, that's my sense.
433
It's not.
434
It's getting there, right?
435
Because these offers happen.
436
500 million is not, I mean, we have a little bit of fun here, right?
437
In any absolute sense, it's an insane amount of money, right?
438
But it's not enough in venture, right?
439
Jason, what ownership do you have in those two companies?
440
Let's just average them to 10.
441
Nice.
442
Wow.
443
Good feedback, Jason.
444
Dude, that in yours funds, what, 70?
445
Yeah, but that, but I did one.
446
Like, everyone talks in venture about fund returners like they're so great.
447
I don't think they're so great.
448
Well, it depends.
449
Look, you're in that business, though.
450
I mean, obviously, look, that's not the perspective of someone who has an $8 billion fund where they are humble enough to recognize that the poor guys are just going to have to chip away $2 billion at a time.
451
Yeah, poor guys.
452
Yeah, I'm not into that vibe.
453
Like, it's just not worth it.
454
But really, I don't think a fund returner for seed is really enough.
455
I mean, it's the classic 1X, and then two deals do 0.05X, right?
456
And the rest do another, and you drib and drab to the 3X, right?
457
You drib and drab, but, you know, I don't want to be in a walker.
458
I need a nice place in Marleybone.
459
Is that where 20 DC is?
460
Is it Marleybone?
461
Maribyn, yeah.
462
Yeah, I want one of those carriage houses, and I want like a nice one.
463
You know, I want a nice one to, you know, that's going to be my fourth house in Marleybone down those cobbled streets with those carriage houses.
464
You know what I'm talking about.
465
Then you should start a podcast, buddy.
466
That's one way to do it.
467
That's one way to do it.
468
Can I ask what I thought when we're speaking about exit values?
469
There was something fascinating.
470
It was Venkat, an LP, interesting LP.
471
And they basically did this analysis of exit values.
472
And they found that in the 99th percentile exit, so the top 1%, the price or the value grew from $1.4 billion in 2005, 2009 to 10.2 billion in the most recent five-year period.
473
Almost like a five or a 6x in the top 1%'s exit value.
474
I wanted to hear your take on this first.
475
And Rory, please slam the question in whatever way you feel relevant.
476
First of all, I thought it was great analysis to the point where I actually emailed David and said, I put this down as mine, and you knew that I didn't do it.
477
Absolutely.
478
Because it was mathematically correct, so I knew it wasn't Harry.
479
Look, I think it was, it's great analysis, profoundly great.
480
The question is, and you know, what it's being used to do is try and hypothesize: if this trend continues, how big will exits be in two, three, four, five years?
481
And thus, how much, you know, what's the ability of venture to raise ever and ever larger aggregate amounts and still make the math work?
482
That's the embedded question in this.
483
Unfortunately, the answer is one of degree, right?
484
In the sense of it definitely points to a small number of exits getting larger, though the trend is not as pronounced as you think.
485
The first period of time was 2000 to 2004, where the 98 percentile exit was as high as 3.3 billion.
486
So, in other words, they went down.
487
You had a cyclical downer for 10 years before they started going up in the 2015 to 19 age and then exploding up to 10 billion in 2020 to 2024.
488
So, it's not like this linear growth for all time.
489
It's like a dip and then a growth back.
490
So, that's the first comment.
491
So, it's not as kind of clear a trend as you think.
492
But I do believe at some macro level it's correct.
493
And it's simple.
494
It's not that things are getting better.
495
It's just that the longer you hold the company, the more compounding takes place, the more dispersion takes place.
496
The big get bigger, and the shittier ones are crap.
497
It's just math.
498
And therefore, by definition, if the window to stay private stays longer, the size of the largest exit will be higher.
499
I've no doubt that the largest single exit in this database in 2020 to 2024, the largest single outcome was actually 65 billion or above.
500
If there's not four exits above 65 billion in the next five or seven years, then the people who bought Stripe, SpaceX, Databricks, OpenAI, and Anthropic are screwed.
501
So I don't think they're screwed.
502
So I think there's going to be, this trend is going to be even just as, it's going to continue in the next four to five years.
503
There's no doubt in my mind.
504
And it's not for magical reasons.
505
It's just because you're holding longer.
506
Let me give you another example of that.
507
It's really interesting.
508
I looked at historical data.
509
The biggest single exit in the period 2000 to 2004 was a 20, you called it 99 decile.
510
I don't think that's a useful term.
511
The more useful point is it was the largest single exit because there was only one, there was only one in that group.
512
It was a $23 billion exit.
513
It was Google in 04.
514
If Google had stayed private one year longer, Google's market cap in the end of 05, it was about $140 billion.
515
If they just stayed private another year, the entire data would be swamped by the fact that, oh my God, the biggest venture exit ever was $140 billion in 05.
516
If the Google CFO had had a heart attack in 2004 and they postponed their IPO for a year and a half, then the largest exit would have been in 04 and it would have been Google.
517
The point here is all this is a derivative of small numbers of how long the very best companies stay private is all that's going on here.
518
And it's true and it's a thing.
519
What it means is that the bigger your fund, the more imperative it is you have to be in those six deals, which explains why capital is so easy to raise for those companies.
520
It all makes sense.
521
It was great analysis.
522
I'm not sure it points to everybody can do great in venture because everything's going great.
523
I think it points to the top end of a power law where it really matters to be in probably five or six companies at almost any price.
524
But if the top end of the power law is so much larger than it was previously, which I think we'll all agree will be that way in 10 years' time, 2035, are we wrongly negative on the size of light speed, general catalyst, you name your mega funds, because we're considering today's exit size on something that we should consider as 10 years' outside exit size?
525
I'm not negative.
526
I think they have a great business.
527
If you get the capital into those companies, then you're going to do great.
528
I don't know if it supports everyone being able to do that and the scale of late-stage money relative to the opportunity, I think, is much more nuanced.
529
Maybe the way to say this, Harry, is this.
530
The direction of travel is clear.
531
As long as companies stay private longer, there are more opportunities, not just at the 99 percentile, but at the 99.9 percentile, at the very tippy top, one or two deals per decade to be in them and compound for a long period of time.
532
That's definitely true.
533
Does that translate into all the funds making enough return on all the deals to kind of make the late-stage mat work?
534
Not as clear.
535
My major concern is just there's so few companies in that 99.9% decile.
536
It's like a world of concentration on like any that I think we've seen.
537
You're exactly right.
538
So, how do you know in a unicorn whether you should keep in or sell?
539
How do you know?
540
Where's the line?
541
That's actually a great question.
542
Obviously, look, it's so annoying.
543
It always looks so clear in retrospect.
544
You obviously shouldn't have sold any SpaceX ever.
545
So, the question is: you know, how do you know at the time?
546
And I think it really is a function of market size momentum.
547
Most, I mean, it's the classic problem: if you're presented with an exit opportunity at 5 billion, right?
548
Statistically.
549
Let's say I could cash it all out the last cursor round at 9 billion.
550
I mean, Mary Meeker used to do this analysis of IPOs, which was excellent.
551
And because I believe private late-stage companies in 2025 are just the same asset class as IPOs in 95 to 2005, the same analysis applies.
552
Most of the companies barely beat their IPO price a year later or ever again.
553
And a small number of companies compound and do amazing.
554
So now, how does that become actionable?
555
If you're sitting there and you can sell all your private companies at 5 billion or the last round price, statistically, 80% of the time you should sell because that's what the stats say.
556
But 20% of the time will cover.
557
The interesting thing is the 20% will not just make money themselves, but will cover all everything else.
558
The wonderful thing about this business is compounding is a very forgiving thing.
559
So obviously, if you're smart enough to be able to tell the one good one from the four bad ones, sell the shit ones, keep the good one, and you'll be rich.
560
But if you can't do that, it is a matter of mathematical truth that the second best alternative is holding them all, provided you have one of the good ones in there.
561
What's going on with all these late-stage funds is some version of holding them all.
562
If I do enough and I'm in the good ones and I double down on the good one, the long-term trend to a massive tail of the power law is going to make me money.
563
My new rule is, and listen, this is, you're lucky to be there, right?
564
But when I was looking at this on a spreadsheet, my new rule is at 2 billion, sell unless you're 100% sure you shouldn't as a seat manager at 2 billion.
565
I know it sounds goofy, but it sort of ties to doing better than returning the fund.
566
Because the risk is, unless you're sure, unless you're sure it's a SpaceX, right?
567
The truth is this: it's a hard comment, but they've made it harder for most investors and most funds because you're exactly right.
568
Now, now you have to make these choices, whereas before you got liquidity on the mall, now you're still in private land and you got to try and figure it out.
569
And you're having to make those decisions with a smaller portfolio account.
570
The truth is, if you need 20 deals, you know, when you're starting at a billion to compound to 100 billion, at your stage, Jason, the portfolio count you need is much higher.
571
And the way that manifests itself, if you've constructed your portfolio 10 years ago, assuming you got your eggs at 100 to 200, the risky thing is now you still got to double down one or two or three more years from here.
572
And as you say, the bad outcome is you have the 80%, but not the 20%, and you don't have the compounder that forgives all sins.
573
So I think it's pretty smart.
574
That's why the whole push towards taking money off the table as a secondary is just smart.
575
I don't think you can take the risk of doubling down ad nauseum when you're 10 or 12 years in.
576
It sucks, but there you are.
577
Yeah, I remember back in the day, I'm dating myself, but I was an emergency CEO with Peter Gastner at Viva, right?
578
And I saw a little bit of it happening, and their LPs were very mad when they held because they were the only real investor in Viva, right?
579
30%.
580
They owned 30% at IPO.
581
And I was just looking it up.
582
It was worth, which was a lot of money back then.
583
It was worth $2.4 billion at IPO, right?
584
Let the partners hold, but distribute to the LPs.
585
They're going to get $750 million.
586
And it was probably a $250 million fund.
587
We could look it up, right?
588
It's a multiple fund returner on that one, right?
589
And because we had a few, when I was just starting, we had some LPs 100, and they were kind of mad that what you guys held, but today it's worth, even with some volatility, it's worth $40 billion.
590
Agreed.
591
$25.
592
Right.
593
And created billionaires out of that, out of GPs.
594
Created billionaires by holding.
595
But how do you know?
596
And I knew Peter was the best one out of our class.
597
Like there was David Sachs, who was like 10 times better than me, and there was Renee Lessert and others, but Peter was like fucking off the planet in terms of quality as a CEO.
598
But I didn't have the numbers, right?
599
But they made the bet, didn't they?
600
Yes, they did.
601
And the thing they had to their advantage was, well, advantage or disadvantage was when you're public, you can make that decision.
602
You can distribute enough different people to make different decisions.
603
That's the beauty of the public markets.
604
If Viva had compounded as a private company, the company would still have been the same, but those choices would have been harder to make.
605
And different, you know, it wouldn't have been as easy.
606
There's no distribution as a concept.
607
So interestingly enough, I hadn't processed this until real time.
608
The incentive, and this is where I go back to my monothematic theme of the death of IPOs, is just bad news all around for capital allocation.
609
Because now, as a GP, you're sitting there going, I want to hold this thing forever.
610
My LP would probably like to get some liquidity.
611
If it was public, I'd distribute and I'd keep mine.
612
They'd sell theirs.
613
Everybody would be happy because everyone can make choice and choice leads to optimal outcomes.
614
Because we can't go public, I either have to sell now, which maybe is not what I want, or I have to ride it out for the next five years, which is maybe not what my LP wants.
615
And I think that's inducing some tension in the system, which would go away if these things were public.
616
Taxes alone can be an incentive for a GP to hold.
617
Taxes alone, and most of our LPs don't pay any taxes, right?
618
I mean, there's many other reasons, right?
619
But taxes alone, especially if you don't have QSBS, you're like, ah, I got to pay 50% in San Francisco.
620
Maybe I'll hold for another year, see what happens.
621
You have 50% capital gains.
622
Well, if it's short-term capital gains, right?
623
It's still going to be, even with long-term, you're going to pay 15% in California, 22%, you're going to still pay 40% in California, long-term capital gain.
624
In fact, you have less than 10% of our cap gains.
625
You guys wouldn't, I mean, I don't know if you saw the Wall Street Journal today just dissing on Europe.
626
You don't have any cap gains, so it doesn't matter.
627
The taxation rate is purely notional.
628
What was that Wall Street Journal piece, Roy?
629
That was the chart I put, the ratio of Europe to U.S.
630
for one gig.
631
What did it show, Jason?
632
U.S.
633
companies, 90 companies worth over a billion, worth $2.5 trillion, and EU only $333 billion, right?
634
So $333 billion versus $2.53 trillion.
635
And a big chunk of the EU was Stripe, which, you know, we can debate whether that's a European startup or not.
636
Harry's got 100 of the best founders addressing this problem.
637
So I'm not worried in five years.
638
Sometimes I'm surprised there isn't more capital flight from at least like the U.S.
639
makes it pretty hard to leave the country and it's a pretty bad tough country to leave.
640
But I'm surprised there aren't more people in Miami than there are.
641
I'm really surprised there are not more because, Harry, you saved 15% just moving over to Miami.
642
There's some asterisks and daggers with it.
643
Yeah, I've clarified my internal situation.
644
If I were to reduce my income tax by 25% by moving to a non-tax-based state, I would also reduce my net worth by 50% because my wife would be staying behind.
645
So it's just not an option for me.
646
So I'm at peace with paying whatever Gavin Newsom needs to keep this kind of bloated, overpaid show on the road.
647
It's a great place to live.
648
So I'm genuine comment.
649
I wish it were lower, but tax is not the reason to leave California.
650
We should all be so lucky to have cap gains.
651
But the serious comment you made, Jason, is that the beauty of public markets is it allows everyone to make their own choices on their own economic decisions, and they can hold if they want to build wealth.
652
They can sell and pay taxes.
653
I do believe we will look back and say there are reasons why the very best companies choose not to go public, but it's a darn shame that the public markets haven't addressed those concerns such that all this stuff could be done in the public markets.
654
Number one thing that you'd change if you ran public markets to make it more appetizing for companies to go public?
655
I love the idea of time-based voting that they floated in Don't Quote Minister Dallas, that there's Texas trying to get together an exchange with some of the lean company startups and some other folks.
656
I don't remember the people, but the idea that your share waiting is in part a portion of how long you've been an investor in the company.
657
It's kind of an extended version of the kind of just founder voting, whereby, because what happens in a public company is sometimes, you know, all the arbitrars, all the short-term investors pile in and they really push the company to make short-term decisions.
658
But if your vote was in partly a predicate of how long you'd been an owner of the company, I think that could lead to very different results.
659
That's one random comment.
660
I don't know how to get away from the randomness, the noise level around quarterly calls and all that process.
661
I mean, Google for a long while did that by simply not doing them, which may be one approach.
662
I wish you could reduce just the anxiety and tension of that part of being public and always being on display.
663
I don't know how to do that part of it.
664
I do think forcing longer-term holders is part of it.
665
Sometimes I wonder if it's really so broken, right?
666
Some of our favorite CEOs from your portfolio.
667
So Aaron Levy, he's, you know, all in, right?
668
But certainly spoken of the headaches of activist shareholders and all that at box, right?
669
Huge headache for him.
670
Then I was interviewing Brian Halligan a little while ago.
671
You know, he has some perspective on this now that he's chairman.
672
He's like, honestly, it's not much more.
673
It's not that much more work, but HubSpot's a $30 billion company.
674
So maybe the bar should just be high.
675
So you don't have to deal with these issues.
676
If you hit your numbers, if you go 50% of $500 million and you grow, it's not really much of a huge deal.
677
You have a huge finance team.
678
It's not the end of the world to go public, is it?
679
So a couple of comments.
680
One is, the odd thing you have is the companies that do precisely the best are precisely the ones who are in a position not to do it at all.
681
You know, you have the Stripe situation.
682
So it's the companies who want access to the capital at the 200, 300, 400 level for whom it's still a big, relatively big burden.
683
But I do agree, your point is actually the right one, not mine, frankly, which is, even though it's a bit of a pain in the ass, I do wish you could deal with things like activism, silly regulations around board and board composition and all that.
684
The real point is people respond to economic stimuli.
685
If the capital were more expensive in the private markets than the public markets, then most CEOs would go to the public markets.
686
The core reason it works is because there's a lot of capital available in private markets for companies doing $200 or $300 million in revenues with a lot less hassle than getting that same capital in the public side.
687
And that's the reason they do it.
688
People respond to price signals.
689
CEOs respond to cost of capital signals.
690
And there's no doubt that, bizarrely enough, the cost of capital in the private markets remains cheaper than the public markets.
691
Now, it's interesting when you look back on the CHIME $25 billion raise, an objective fact is this.
692
The cost of that capital was twice as high as you thought at the time because you didn't give away 4%, you gave away 8%.
693
So it may well be that we're in this little bubble where we actually don't know the cost of capital for some of these late-stage rounds.
694
And if you get high-priced rounds with lots of price protection and you ultimately go public, you may.
695
I don't think you'll ever go back to $100 million IPOs, but I think there'll be more of a normalization on your choices between public and private.
696
I want to finish today, if that's okay, with one final segment, which is my team love Calci, like a predictions marketplace where you place bets in the real world.
697
They love it.
698
And I chose three that I liked.
699
Number one, will OpenAI stop being a non-profit?
700
Yes or no?
701
The news cycle is so fast, as you pointed out Harry.
702
I mean, what a loss for Sam versus Elon Musk in the short term.
703
What a loss, man.
704
We already forgot about it.
705
It's a total capitulation to ever being a traditional for-profit company, right?
706
I'm going to go with yes, because the question is weakly phrased enough that I can answer yes.
707
Will it stop being a non-profit?
708
It doesn't give a time.
709
At some point, this company is going to get public.
710
It's going to have a PBC-type structure.
711
It will get there.
712
It'll take a lot of lawyers, but it will get there.
713
So I bet yes on that one because there's no timing.
714
Jason, I've never seen a dysfunctional company that's more successful than OpenAI.
715
I mean, all the founders left, they fired the CEO, brought him back, non-profit, left-profit, for-benefit, non-benefit.
716
The momentum's crazy, but man, the motivations are really weird in a nonprofit.
717
And giving that up, the folks I've seen on non-profit boards, they're not going to give up this power.
718
They're not going to give it up.
719
No one I've seen on a non-profit board wants to give up the power because there's no money in it.
720
So it's all about the power.
721
I'm going to disagree a little bit on that because I think that the motivations in terms of being a nonprofit were much more important for the engineering staff and the early employees who really had a real profound belief that they were doing something important for mankind.
722
I mightn't share that belief in the slightest, to be clear, but I think that was an animating factor.
723
And it's no accident, in my view, that the two companies that have been most successful, OpenAI and Entropic, embraced that because they recognized that the most important audience for both of them was talented AI engineers, and all of them shared the religion that said this thing could change the world and be dangerous.
724
So therefore, they embrace the religion too.
725
I don't think it's a question of the board of OpenAI not wanting to give it up.
726
I think Brett Taylor is just such a smart dude.
727
I think it's a question of untangling the mess when you've got litigation on every side, Elon busting your chops, a bunch of state's attorneys, and you kind of know where you want to go.
728
It's going to be hard to get there, but in the end, the value of the asset is so high that there'll be some half-assed cobble compromise whereby the entity will be a PBC, the not-for-profit will be one level up, and the only question is how much should they get, how much should Microsoft get, how much will the investors get.
729
Somehow they'll figure it out.
730
So I think they'll get there.
731
It'll just be a wild and wacky journey.
732
The second one, and we're going to count by minute response, Max.
733
Chat GPT 5 revealed this year, yes or no?
734
The folks at OpenAI, the engineering talent, is so much better than you realize.
735
It's so next level.
736
It's so next level, right?
737
The talent that OpenAI, Anthropic, Cursor, and Windsurf attract, it's epic.
738
So if they want to merge all their models into one model, which would make my life easier because I can't even tell them apart, that would be great, right?
739
It's time, like, this makes no sense at a consumer level, right?
740
But man, DEASA.
741
Jason's working in his feature requests into the blog.
742
Yeah.
743
But merging all of these, I mean, it wouldn't be surprising to me if it pushes a year longer, right?
744
But they have the best in the world.
745
I'm saying I think no, but it would be great.
746
Okay, you'll know.
747
I'll take you on that one.
748
I'll say yes.
749
I absolutely think they will.
750
The velocity is a little bit more.
751
You have a no, yes, and a don't know.
752
Jason, baby, you want O2 Minis and Maxis.
753
I'll give you Dipling and Real as the final one.
754
Dipling and Real.
755
Dipling and Real.
756
Will Ripling beat Deal in the lawsuit?
757
100%.
758
Yes.
759
There's no chance they'll lose.
760
It could get settled, right?
761
Which is always the right outcome, even when there's a motion.
762
The right outcome is always to settle it, right?
763
There's no way they lose 100%.
764
The facts are too bad.
765
There's no way they lose 100%.
766
They stole trade secrets.
767
This is a classic case.
768
They're going to lose.
769
So, Jason, you're like going to lose.
770
Rory going to lose?
771
I do agree, Jason.
772
I think Ripling prevails in this lawsuit if it goes to court.
773
I think it probably should settle because most civil litigation does settle.
774
But it's hard to imagine from the fact.
775
And I did see the counterclaim just recently, but it's still hard to imagine from the facts as stated.
776
Did you think the counterclaim was weak?
777
It was some version of you guys did it too.
778
I mean, the first filing Ripling made back was, I was sorry, Deal Made Back was pretty blah and weird.
779
It was about four or five weeks ago, and it was full of a lot of kind of weird you went to Harvard or you were angry about something.
780
I didn't quite understand it.
781
This is a counterclaim that said, the guy that we hired, I think you guys hired it.
782
It was all very, you did it too.
783
But I just think, I'm with Jason.
784
I think the facts, and you have the person who made his affidavit, and by the way, you've chosen to run to another country and hide.
785
I just think the fact pattern looks crap, and at some point, sense prevails, and you say, whoopsie, sorry, and settle.
786
So, yes, I.
787
Just as an FY why they do it.
788
And listen, I'm not a litigator, but I've been on the other side.
789
You do tech long enough, you're going to be on both sides of these, right?
790
Counterclaims can offset any claims, even if they're outside of the statute limitations, even if they couldn't be brought on their own.
791
So, let's say Ripling wins, let's say Ripling wins a billion dollars against deal and a lot of damages.
792
Even if they couldn't bring their own lawsuit, they might get an offset for $900 million.
793
There are so many incentives to bring counterclaims that you would not bring as a claim.
794
So, there's always a lot of drama, and some of them won't even make sense.
795
Like, some of the counterclaims don't make sense, right?
796
And they're doing it for, they're doing it not because they think they're going to win.
797
They're doing it because they know they're going to lose.
798
And so, you put everything in a counterclaim because everything counts as an offset, right?
799
It's a sign of losing these counterclaims.
800
It's not a sign of winning.
801
And it's really stressful when you're on the other side and you get 10,000 counterclaims back because there's always some truth in it, right?
802
There's always some truth in it.
803
But it's a litigation game to get offsets.
804
It's a sign, Harry, that they're going to lose.
805
All those counterclaims are ironically a sign they're going to lose.
806
If you're 100% in the clear, you just say not guilty.
807
You just ignore it.
808
And as a CEO, you go back to work.
809
You don't flee to other countries.
810
You go back to work and you say, Parker, you do what Sam's doing with Elon.
811
Sorry, we misunderstood each other, Parker.
812
Happy to have a beer and talk it out.
813
That's what an innocent CEO says.
814
Let's talk about it wherever.
815
How is dying to come in?
816
Let's hear it, Harry.
817
Let's hear it.
818
As Alex is a dear friend and I'm also a deal shareholder, I would just like to add, Alex has actually been abroad for many years.
819
The media amplified him being Zara.
820
He probably wouldn't take it.
821
Even if it was first fucking class, okay, dude.
822
He ain't coming to Dublin to testify on this puppy.
823
So I'm telling you because no one's going to Dublin, Rory.
824
No, but if you're going to win, in all seriousness, if Deal's going to win, okay, you do what Sam did to Elon.
825
You say to Parker, I know we disagree.
826
Sorry, as friends.
827
Let's get together.
828
We used to be partners.
829
They used to be integrated.
830
They used to be partners.
831
We'll work together again.
832
Sorry, we disagree.
833
Sorry, things happened that shouldn't have happened.
834
Let's talk about it.
835
And you don't say anything else, but that's what you say if there's really nothing there.
836
That's the power play.
837
I'd go further.
838
It's what you say if there's nothing there, and it's what you say if it's there also, because you settle this thing, because nothing good is going to come from this kind of litigation.
839
And I checked it not now, but a few weeks ago, we thought we were going to talk about this.
840
All of this is just civil litigation.
841
But the scary thing is some of the allegations could be interpreted in a criminal fashion.
842
If I was the CEO of Deal, I would want to get this behind me so fast my head would hurt.
843
I'd want to settle and bury it deep and say, whoopsie, sorry, donation to the charity, your choices, whatever.
844
I would want this done because I don't know if this is going to escalate to criminal.
845
Because one of the things that's very funny when you see the difference between civil and criminal is in civil, people yell at each other.
846
And I think the criminal FBI, et cetera, are way more jaundiced and hard-nosed.
847
And they're just like, we're not going to get involved just because you kiddies are fighting with each other.
848
They're only going to get involved if they see malfeasance.
849
But the more noise you make and the more yelling you do, the more risk you have is that someone looks at the file and says, Let me.
850
That would be an espionage issue.
851
Suddenly, we've drifted into some kind of theft of trade properties, and suddenly someone opens an investigation.
852
Then you're fucked.
853
If I was, my ass was on the line and I was the CEO of Deal, I'd be like, How much money does it take to settle this thing by Friday?
854
Get it done.
855
I know, Alex, this is not going to happen.
856
So that's fine.
857
Hey, look, it's a free country.
858
Look, people do what they go to.
859
Like to all founders out there, settle everything.
860
Especially when you're not in the wrong.
861
When you're not in the wrong, settle it, right?
862
Because it's so hard if you're not in the wrong to settle it, right?
863
It's so wrong.
864
That's the number one reason to settle it.
865
We would settle everything.
866
But I will say this.
867
Two observations.
868
One is everyone gets really emotional about litigation and starts getting personally invested in it.
869
That's the first thing.
870
But then the second thing is even more important.
871
The lawyer that you engage will tell you you've got a great case when you start out.
872
As you get closer to the courtroom door and as you spend more and more money, they start changing the tune slightly just because suddenly, and maybe you're just not hearing what they're saying on day one.
873
The day before court, they'll be saying, remember, I told you it was a 50-50 bet.
874
And you're like, I've just spent $2 million and six months preparing for this trial.
875
And you're telling me it's a 50-50 bet.
876
And you'll sit there and go, if I knew then what I knew now, I'd have settled at the start.
877
What is the best advice for this?
878
People don't get it.
879
I'm going to put this clipping in a post I did on it.
880
Rory's right.
881
Every single time you've been through, you meet with the lawyers and they tell you, if you have a decent, your case is super strong, right?
882
They tell you in the meeting.
883
$2 million later, it gets close to trial, and they're like, well, those counterclaims, I mean, they are silly, but a jury might not see it that way.
884
It's never worth it for either, like, it's almost never worth it.
885
But that story, every time you get your dander up and a lawyer tells you you've got a super strong case, I literally just went through this with the CEO.
886
I said, hire someone great and have them play the other side.
887
I literally just went through this with the CEO: play the other side, because they're going to tell you Rory's story, and you're not going to want to do it anymore.
888
100% of the time, they change their tune.
889
It's about $2 million in, they change their tune, isn't it?
890
It's right around $2 million of legal expenses.
891
That's so true.
892
It's funny.
893
My wife was a criminal defense attorney, and she would always say, The worst defendants are defendants who start talking about principles.
894
I don't want to hear about your principles.
895
I want to just hear what it takes to settle this thing.
896
Don't get on your dignity.
897
You guys said before about the amount of kids being put through college because of Open AI's legal bills and everything around its legal bills.
898
I think the same applies here.
899
The end case, invest in Wilson, Cincinnati, and Cooley.
900
Actually, but before we go, how could I forget?
901
This was one of the biggest weeks for Jason with SAST.
902
So, Jason, before we leave today, I want to talk about SASTA.
903
You had the biggest and the best there.
904
What are your big takeaways from seeing the world of SAS come together in one place?
905
The biggest takeaway, I think, what Yamini from HubSpot and Aaron Levy both said is: I'm super excited, but I'm anxious.
906
There was literally 50 times more energy at SASTA this year than last year.
907
2024, I didn't realize it till I was there.
908
It was the end of the Debbie Downer era.
909
It was the end of folks saying, Woe is me.
910
I was growing 70% in 2021, selling my fungible sales automation tool, and now I'm growing 2%.
911
Last year, they were still there.
912
These people did not show up.
913
And this was your idea, Harry.
914
We had 300 sessions.
915
I didn't allow one single session to talk about the past.
916
From the CEO of Snowflake, HubSpot, we banned the past this year.
917
You were right, right?
918
And it created like incredible energy and anxiety, but good anxiety, right?
919
You got to work twice as hard or twice as fast.
920
I think that's great positioning because it was either after 08, 09, or I think it might have been after the dot-com crash.
921
What you saw two or three years later is even the survivors were scarred and there was just no ability to talk upside.
922
And you're like, oh my God, I got from 10 to 15 to 18.
923
But I'm just so shattered from the pain of the last three years that I lacked the capacity to think big again.
924
And many of those companies, as a result, didn't make it.
925
And I think that's really good positioning.
926
You know, it's coming out hopefully into a picking up time.
927
And I think that's what it takes to win this year because this whole SaaS is dying is bullshit.
928
It's changing.
929
And you better be AI forward or dead.
930
But if you are, I'm very certain that if you do the right, make the right moves, you can grab hold of this thing and not just grow, but re-accelerate growth, which I think is what 25 has to be all about.
931
Jason Carr, you mentioned last week about eyeing clay out of fear and saying, hey, Rory, come to the CMO event, come to the CMO event.
932
I'm sure Rory was there cheering from the front row.
933
I was in spirit.
934
But what were the takeaways from the CMO event?
935
A budget's open again.
936
Are they buying clay out of fear?
937
What was that takeaway?
938
The basic vibe was everyone recognized 20 to 30 percent of their team is going to be replaced with AI and they're happy for it.
939
Whether they're ready, whether the tools are ready today or whether it's going to be six months, no one wants, everyone was ready and behind closed doors, borderline excited for the bottom of the 20 or 30 percent of their teams to be replaced by AI.
940
No one's regretting it.
941
No one's wondering, my God, my culture is going to be impacted at my company if the sales rep that takes a week to get back to somebody loses their job to AI.
942
No one was regretting the impact on culture.
943
Seriously, no one was regretting it.
944
They were embracing it.
945
How soon can I deploy tools to migrate out the bottom 30% of my company?
946
I don't want them.
947
No one wants to do that.
948
The thing about Jason is: it's not just that he's the grim reaper, but he's the happy grim reaper.
949
He's like, I love my work.
950
Let's do some reaping here, right?
951
And yeah, maybe the positive spin on that is you can grow 30% next year and not add any headcount.
952
But, you know, it's the same story, just perhaps a little bit more benignly placed.
953
And we all know it won't actually happen that way.
954
There will be some churn.
955
But yes, it's all versions of the same story, which is AI is a productivity lift at some level.
956
They're stressed about the change, though, because almost everybody also recognized moats are weaker.
957
Whether you're Windsurf or HubSpot, the moats are weaker.
958
I buy that.
959
Now, I think over time, moats will emerge, but you're exactly right.
960
This is a, we often refer to some deals as it's a run-fast deal.
961
A good portion of the value that will be created over the next three years is just by running fast.
962
You talk about running fast.
963
I mean, to be fair, Windsurf ran faster than anyone in terms of what they built as quickly as they did do, and then to get to the sale position that they did do.
964
And then last night or yesterday, whenever it was, Microsoft announced obviously their open sourcing VS Code, really putting a dent, I think some would say, in the hopes and enthusiasms and valuations of Windsurf and Cursor.
965
How did you guys analyze that one when you saw that announcement about open sourcing VS Code?
966
It's interesting because, yes, it amps up the competitive tension, but it is also worth stepping back.
967
If you were the developer behemoth, which was Microsoft, the fact that you have to do this now to remain relevant.
968
But, you know, if you had dominance already, you wouldn't feel the need to, right?
969
You know, they're not going to open source Windows OS.
970
There's been talked over the years, right?
971
When you have a dominant position, you don't have to be nice.
972
This is a manifestation of them feeling competitive heat, always recognizing, as they have for 30, 40 years now, developers, developers.
973
So they're doing something to stay competitive.
974
So it might dint your perceived valuation if you're one of the competitors, but you got to give yourself an ad-a-boy.
975
You know, you punched hard enough on a $2 trillion, $3 trillion market cap company that they felt the need to make this move.
976
Did anyone have an AI SDR that actually worked?
977
Do they work and does value accrue are two different questions, and they occur in roughly that sequence.
978
In other words, if you don't have clarity on if they work or not, then you shouldn't be thinking about where does value accrue because no one's going to make any value anywhere.
979
So first you got to say to yourself, what parts of the sales process can be automated?
980
And I'm 100% with Jason.
981
There are parts that work well today.
982
There are parts that will work well in six, nine months as the kind of technology progresses.
983
And there are parts that don't work well.
984
You probably don't do your marquee email to your very best prospect, but you all have coming back from a trade show or something like that, masses and masses of leads that just don't get followed up on, right?
985
There's a whole bucketization of it's not so much the marquee work you're already doing, it's all the work you should be doing, but you never get around to.
986
That alone is a significant lift.
987
It's back to what Jason says, it's this 50% idea.
988
If you make the reps 50% more productive, if you get them to focus on their key tasks, you're giving yourself 50% lift, and that's nothing.
989
And we've seen that in all, I think, in all our AI companies, which is why, you know, going back to the investing thing, step one in all these deals, and every AI deal is: do you, the vendor, and you, the customer, have a mutually agreed figure of merit on what success looks like that you can both track?
990
If not, at some point, you're going to churn.
991
Because one side of the other, either you're going to underperform or they're going to think you're going to underperform.
992
You have to be aligned around that.
993
And then you have to be really honest: are you delivering it?
994
And time everything, your pacing, your aggression, to when you are, in fact, delivering enough value to be able to keep them happy and keep them moving forward.
995
I do think to Harry's point, though, I'm not smart enough to know which hundred to invest in, right?
996
On the other hand, how many note-taker apps are there, right?
997
I believe, based on CD Insights, there's over 18,000 note-taking apps.
998
But on the other hand, it has a privileged position at Zoom, but Otter AI just announced it cost $100 million in revenue, right?
999
And there's several over 10.
1000
And so I'm like, this crap's bundled in, and like, I can't tell the difference.
1001
And note-taking is becoming like voice, like Gong.
1002
Like for a while, Gong was disruptive, and it still is.
1003
But now that functionality is built into everything, right?
1004
But go back, because I think Gong is interesting, actually, because you made the comment.
1005
I think that's an example of someone who took voice as an entry point, built a compelling multi-hundred million dollar AOR business.
1006
But if you look at what they do today, voice recording, let's call it sales-specific note-taking, which was core to what they did five years ago, is only a part of what they do today.
1007
And what they've done is they've used that entry point.
1008
They've built a stack, they've added forecasting, they've added CRM updating, they've added a whole bunch of related functionality.
1009
And now, I believe they're reacting to.
1010
And I think that's going to be the dominant mode for a lot of these companies.
1011
That's why I call them run-fast deals.
1012
You got to pick your wedge AI entry point for that two or three years where there's kind of magic AI premium, but you've got to operate on the assumption that three, five years from now, the core thing you do is going to be commodified.
1013
And what you've got to do is have used the magic moment to get the distribution and then built on top of that defensibility.
1014
Ganga, I think, has done a very good job of that.
1015
Amazon, Apple, Google, we name the most defining companies of our time.
1016
And the list can go on and on and on.
1017
You can even choose big consumer brands.
1018
Point is, Fireflies, Otter, Granola, every sub-verticles, just for me as an investor, they bring them to the IC with me.
1019
And I'm like, oh, this is not a deal that I want to be in.
1020
One of 100.
1021
I can remember being a snarky little 30-year-old VC making snide comments that Amazon was just a bookseller, okay?
1022
I remember in 96 when Kleiner did the round, and I think they went public in 97.
1023
That was when companies actually went public quickly.
1024
And, you know, it was a very, you know, you could have got your head around the teeny tiny tam.
1025
It was a way.
1026
The thing is, sometimes you got to see the wedge point, the wedge, and then where you can go from there.
1027
So I do hear you.
1028
No-taking is a crowded vertical, it's a crowded space.
1029
It's one I actually love and would like to find a play in and could talk about for a while later.
1030
But sometimes don't make the mistake of looking just at the market today.
1031
Look at where you can go with that product and can you articulate a longer vision?
1032
But Rory, going to Harry's point, when you're looking at deals at scale today, has defensibility and unique selling proposition, has that gone down when you score a deal, has it gone down?
1033
That's kind of the question Harry's asking because he's brought these deals, the revenue's there, he likes the founder, but he can't, defensibility appears to approach zero in some of these deals.
1034
We just actually had a polite version of an argument on this in our partners' meeting just yesterday, right?
1035
You know, I'm looking at a deal, I won't say which one, which is in a very commodified market with lots of revenue, lots of good growth, but oh my God, they can name 10 competitors.
1036
And one of my other partners that I've worked for 20 plus years is looking at a high-risk, high-intellectual property deal with no revenues right now, but clearly, and you know, lots of technical risk, but clearly, if you pull it off, massive defensibility.
1037
And we're sitting here going, how do we trade off these two things?
1038
And I will say, we've definitely skewed more talk.
1039
We will do the run-fast deals, but you got to go in with your eyes open and know that you have the team that will run fast.
1040
And from a portfolio construction perspective, I really like the fact that we're trying to add some more singular, different companies where it's an N of one, ideally with some more product market fit, but where you kind of go, this has defensibility and a much longer run.
1041
Because I don't want to wake up with every deal being exactly, you know, GPT plus and 27 competitors in three years.
1042
So it's a tough and competitive investing environment from those perspectives.
1043
Listen, behind it all is the model providers, the ones that are the shit businesses, right?
1044
We go through the peaks and troughs of like, oh, they're great, they're commodities.
1045
And now we're in the realization that OpenAI and Anthropic are actually phenomenal businesses.
1046
Anthropic run rate revenue grew from a billion in Q424 to 2 billion in Q125.
1047
100,000 plus customers grew 8x.
1048
How did we analyze?
1049
I mean, listen, you can segment the market, but it's also true that Anthropic's a distant number two in some ways, right?
1050
And that growth is jaw-dropping, right?
1051
On the other hand, listen, I'm not...
1052
You guys have chatted about it.
1053
I mean, OpenAI also said they're going to burn at least another $44 billion until they're profitable in 2029.
1054
At least another $44 billion.
1055
It is jaw-dropping.
1056
It's the old Amazon thing from the old days.
1057
Arreu said on like 18 doses of steroids, right?
1058
Everyone's all in.
1059
It's another 44 billion, but it's clearly a multi-trillion dollar company.
1060
So the math ties, is it a new world or will it collapse on itself?
1061
I interviewed a growth investor this morning.
1062
Sorry, Twin Church, you were in.
1063
He's already a holder in Anthropic, and he said, I'm trying to buy every employee's options.
1064
I'm trying to buy everything around Anthropic that I can.
1065
I'll get a billion dollars worth.
1066
I've got supply from my LPs for five.
1067
I believe it.
1068
Because they're great businesses.
1069
And, you know, I haven't cycled through the way you described the updone.
1070
They always have to be great businesses because they're the most defensible part of the stack.
1071
I mean, I don't buy the commodification argument.
1072
There's going to be two or three of them.
1073
I don't think there's going to be 10.
1074
People are going to build around that and they're going to make technical choices.
1075
And you're going to fast forward five years.
1076
And just like lots of people could do Amazon web services in 2007 or eight, you know, once you're 10 years in and you have the scale and you have the development environments and all the rest, those are going to be great businesses.
1077
They're going to be great businesses.
1078
Will they be worth 300 billion or 1 trillion?
1079
I don't have a developed opinion, but no, they're the anchor tenants of the AI economy, just as Amazon, Azure, and whatever Google Cloud were kind of.
1080
Chegg, $12 billion to $95 million, third round of layoffs.
1081
Is this just exactly what we said, that most are smaller than ever and companies can be changed overnight?
1082
Yes, short answer.
1083
And why would I pay Chegg for X when I can literally type it into ChatGPT?
1084
Now, that was a business that was, you know, dead loadkill in front of.
1085
Jason, what's the most obvious nice Cheg?
1086
The tough one, if MCP really works, right?
1087
And it's very interesting seeing HubSpot and Box and Dropbox be excited about MC, if it really works, we won't even really need these applications.
1088
If I can use NCP to grab my content from Box and I can do better, more powerful things with it by combining it with my own model, I'll barely even know Box exists.
1089
And look, HubSpot is great, but if my own AI can pull out all the structured information out of HubSpot and run my own AI the way I want to do it, I might not even, you know, what is HubSpot going to be worth to me?
1090
If I can put my own AI and my own agents on top of these apps, all these ones that we think are so great because they're databases, I think they instantly become vulnerable because they just become databases.
1091
They just become databases.
1092
And I think they know it.
1093
I think that's why everyone's stressed.
1094
The only pushback I'd give is the word instantly.
1095
I mean, I think, I do believe AI will exert pressure on some of these apps in terms of newer solutions to do it.
1096
But I do think we should assume that the replacement cycle plays out over 10 plus years.
1097
I think the existing dominant vendors have a chance to ride it out.
1098
I think, look at what ServiceNow is doing very aggressively.
1099
But I think you're right, if you are asleep, if your app doesn't deliver a ton of value, then you're going to be able to do that.
1100
People say that about Salesforce.
1101
If you were to look forward, would you be a buyer or a seller on Salesforce with the potential for it to be a database overnight?
1102
Yeah, I mean, I hold Salesforce stock.
1103
I'm not a seller.
1104
I think they're not going to be an explosive goer from here, to say the least.
1105
But I think one thing we underestimate is the power of incumbency, not to be a venture-type IRR performer where you're hyper-growth and tracking an IPO, but just the ability of these big tech companies to extract massive profits and massive cash flow at scale.
1106
If Salesforce is, quote, just a database in 10 or 15 years, it doesn't mean they can't still kick off gabs and gabs of cash.
1107
I mean, all you have to do is look at Oracle.
1108
It's not only is it just a database, it is a freaking database.
1109
That's what they did first.
1110
And Larry, depending on the day, is somewhere between the first and the fourth, richest man on the planet.
1111
He's not sitting there going, oh, I wish I was cool in AI, right?
1112
He's going, I know how to optimize every damn dime from these corporate customers.
1113
We'll ship just enough new stuff to keep them on board, and we will build a wildly proper, I think, 43% operating margin business.
1114
So I'm not looking at Salesforce to provide the oomph in my portfolio, but I wouldn't want to offload that stock with those cash flows because I just don't think it's going away.
1115
We use Salesforce in our shop here.
1116
I think I'll be dead before we rip it out.
1117
Listen, guys, the average episode that we do now gets 3.5 million plays now across the five.
1118
Pretty fucking cool.
1119
I so appreciate you guys.
1120
Rory, thank you for rephrasing every question.
1121
So Jason's going to fire me and just get an AI hang.
1122
I just want to be clear.
1123
All I want to do is.
1124
I just want to say it would be fun.
1125
I was just bringing it back to the first two minutes.
1126
It took you 30 minutes to even get back to the second question.
1127
I was like, dude, I didn't prepare for freaking VS sparking.
1128
Give me a break here.
1129
I blame Jason.
1130
They were in his notes.
1131
Guys, you're amazing.
1132
Thank you so much.
1133
All right, rock and roll.
1134
Take care, guys.
1135
Dipling and reel for the win.
1136
I mean, you hear it in my voice.
1137
Those shows are my favorite shows of the week to record.
1138
Jason and Rory are just such incredible people.
1139
We've got a very special guest joining us next week.
1140
I cannot wait to bring you that episode.
1141
I hope you enjoy it.
1142
Let me know what you think.
1143
I love your feedback.
1144
Let me know.

Now let's switch gears from cloud innovation to the future of mobile and how one company is turning your screen into real returns.
1168
We spend nearly half our waking hours glued to our phones, upwards of 50 hours every week.
1169
Recently, one company transforming this reality stood out so much I personally became a shareholder, Mode Mobile.
1170
Mode Mobile created the earn phone, the smartphone that pays you for daily activities.
