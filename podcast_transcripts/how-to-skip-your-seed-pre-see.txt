64% of our companies that we've invested in across fund one and fund two skipped the seed and went straight to a series A.
2
And that's impressive for somebody who might not know because you have to sell part of the company.
3
Correct.
4
You've saved 10% on valuation.
5
You've saved 10% of the company for yourself by skipping a stage.
6
Which is always good.
7
Because at the end of the day, the math is that when the company exits, how much of the company does the founder own?
8
Yeah.
9
Right?
10
And the less you sell along the way, the more you own.
11
Welcome to the PEAL.
12
I'm your host, Turner Novak, founder of Banana Capital.
13
Today's guest is Animetra Benerji, co-founder of Afor Capital, investing in and leading pre-seed rounds.
14
Back in 2016, we found that many seed investors weren't really seeding.
15
Our conversation gets to the evolution of pre-seed as a category, how to skip your seed and go straight to Series A, and what AFOR looks for when backing founders before they even have a product.
16
It's called the dark arts.
17
The dark arts.
18
It is an investment in a founder's ability to succeed, their potential, not necessarily at the point of investment, but an investment in their ability to grow.
19
Why pre-seed is more than option checks and how to measure obsession.
20
Get up when you fall down is resilience, and that allows you to continue and persevere because you should be willing to persevere against all odds.
21
The secret to raising a Series A as a founder's job should be to have as many options as possible.
22
Why every VC started an accelerator.
23
And so many seed funds who were reliant on deals from YC saw their entry price suddenly shoot up.
24
A force founder in residence program.
25
What we're looking for is really, really interesting people, and we'll invest even if we don't the idea.
26
How AI is changing venture capital.
27
It's going to get tougher for investors because they have to convince a founder who's growing really fast, who doesn't need venture capital to take venture money.
28
And growing up in India, immigrating to the U.S., what do you learned joining Twitter as the first PM, and how Oprah helped create the legendary verified check mark?
29
Whenever a business is conflicted about which way to go, it's usually the business people who win, because the business people can point to immediate revenue.
30
A quick thank you to Garav and Derek at A4 for helping brainstorm topics for Animitra.
31
A reminder: I publish episodes of the Peel every week exploring the world's greatest startup stories just this one.
32
If you missed the last few weeks, check out the back catalog for episodes with Eric Vischer at Benchmark, Sanjit Biswas at Sansara, and Michael Kim at Sendana.
33
Now, a quick word from Warp.
34
This episode is brought to you by Warp.
35
Warp believes payroll is more than an onboarding step, it's the first experience new hires have with your company.
36
It should feel seamless.
37
That's why Warp automates payroll tax setup, ensures multi-state compliance, and streamlines international payments.
38
No delays, no friction, just a smooth arrival that says you've arrived somewhere exceptional.
39
Warp is payroll for founders, swift, modern, and quietly powerful.
40
It handles tax setups, stays compliant across states, and makes international payments feel local.
41
Onboarded minutes pay anyone, anywhere, without the usual friction.
42
Personally, when I hired just one employee using another payroll provider, I had to deal with compliance and taxes in four different states.
43
And I'm excited Warp now exists to save hours of headaches.
44
So, if you're starting a company or looking for a new provider, head to joinwarp.com and try it out.
45
Thank you, Warp.
46
Now, let's talk to Animitra.
47
Animitra, welcome to the show.
48
Thank you, Trina, for having me.
49
I appreciate it.
50
Yeah, this will be fun.
51
Most people might not know this, but they will now.
52
You were my first boss in venture, you gave me my first job, and you were kind enough to join us.
53
So, I've learned a lot through the process.
54
Yeah, so it's basically it's your fault that I'm here, whether this has all been good or bad.
55
It's basically we can blame you or credit you.
56
That's right.
57
And it was a fun time, right?
58
Several years ago, you were hanging out, and there was only what two or three people at a four at the time.
59
Yeah.
60
You guys look a conglomerate now.
61
Well, that probably is strong word, not quite Samsung, but we are larger, about nine people now.
62
Okay.
63
Most of us are in San Francisco.
64
What is a four?
65
Just for people who aren't familiar.
66
Great question.
67
So a four is a venture fund based out of San Francisco.
68
We helped start the pre-seed category back in 2016, back when most founders struggled to raise their very first round.
69
It was supposed to be called a seed round, but we found that many seed investors weren't really seeding.
70
They wanted founders to go and get some traction.
71
But then to get traction, you need some capital.
72
So founders were in cash 22 situations.
73
So many founders were being told by seed funds at the time,, why don't you go raise an angel round or a friends and family round and then come back to us in three months or four months and see, launch a product and then we'll invest.
74
So the founders began to generate a shorthand for that word.
75
They called it the pre-seed round.
76
It was that started around about 2013, 2014.
77
Manu Kumar, I think, came up, coined the word, pre-seed.
78
It is canine.
79
That's right.
80
That's right.
81
Original investors in Lyft, by the way.
82
So, preeminent firm.
83
And so founders began to basically say, what?
84
We should raise a pre-seed round.
85
And then they would go to seed funds, and seed funds would reinforce that.
86
And so we saw that opening happening.
87
And my co-founder, Gaurov, my good friend, I've known him for 12 plus years now.
88
He was at another venture fund called Founder Collective, a seed fund, amazing fund.
89
Our seed investors in a whole host of companies Uber and Kupang and Trade Desk and so on.
90
And I was at a venture fund called Foundation Capital, traditionally Series A founder.
91
And we both began to see that there's this thing happening that founders were describing a new round.
92
And most investors were shying away from it.
93
And we said, why don't we capitalize on that?
94
So why were they shying away?
95
Because it's you're VC, you're investing in a company formation, right?
96 in theory, they should be writing a check in that first round.
97
That's right.
98
I think, I think, in general, it goes to the question is really, why didn't seed funds, this shouldn't exist if seed funds were seeding.
99
Yeah, because the original pitch for seed funds was,, in the 90s or early 2000s, it was you raised 5 million bucks at 10 million pre or what, you give away 30, 40, 50 or 90 of the company.
100
And then seed funds came in as,, the 500K check in an AWS funding round.
101
But they, but that went away.
102
What happened?
103
Well, between 2005 and 2010, angel rounds, which was the, I guess, pre-seed at the time, where angels were getting institutionalized.
104
They're called super angels.
105
And the super angels institutionalized even more and they formed funds and they became the forest rounds, they became the floodgates, they became the founder collectives, they became the enclarks of the world and they became really, really successful.
106
And as a result, many, many seed funds followed.
107
And fast forward to 2016, some of the seed funds continued to truly invest in seed, taking a lot of risk, invention risk, formation risk, founder risk, all of that stuff.
108
But many seed funds became so successful that they wanted to take less risk.
109
They wanted to see more traction because they had more options.
110, whenever, if you think of it from a human being's perspective, when you have two options, you have a deal that hasn't launched yet, two founders still went behind the ears, saying that they're going to launch something and it's going to be great.
111
And on the other hand, you have a founder that has launched, it's got about 10,000 or so in revenue and it's got some prospects, but they're raising a little bit more.
112
You feel a little bit, this one feels a little bit safer than this one.
113
Naturally, investors went this way.
114
And so that created, that always creates an opportunity.
115
So I think it's in general human nature when things become successful, you get bigger.
116
As you get bigger, you go later and you take less risk or a different risk.
117
But that risk became very naturally to us because we were founding product managers.
118
I was the first PM at Android at Twitter.
119
My co-founder was the first PM at Android.
120
So we helped invent products from scratch.
121
And then we had some investing experience.
122
So this for us was natural.
123
So then, yeah, how do you vet a pre-seed founder team?
124
Because when I tell friends,, yeah, I should invest when they're starting the company.
125, is there not a spreadsheet?
126, there's no product you can use.
127, how do you vet that?
128
Yeah, it's called the dark arts.
129
The dark arts.
130
It's called the dark arts.
131
It's a classic hog word.
132
It's the dark arts.
133
You don't know what you're doing.
134
It is, in a way, there is data.
135
It's a different data.
136
You don't have, it's not, it's not in a spreadsheet.
137
It's unstructured data.
138
It's very unstructured.
139
That's right.
140
It's wonderful.
141
It is unstructured data.
142
And it is information.
143
It's partly a lot about the founders.
144
It's there.
145
It's what they have done more recently.
146
It's what they have achieved in life.
147
It's underwriting the human.
148
And then it is validating the way they think about ideas and how they prosecute an idea, how quickly they move through ideas, what they have tried, what they haven't tried, all of that stuff.
149
That generates some data.
150
And that data essentially allows someone us to decide if this group of these founders is going to get off the starting block.
151, are they even going to make the first three months, the first six months, the first 10 months?
152
Are they going to get out and have an impact in some way?
153
We can't really tell what is going to happen in the long run.
154
And our general belief at a four is in the long run, we're all dead.
155
So what matters is what happens in the short run.
156
So can they get to Series A?
157
Can we see then, can we forecast the next 12 months, the next 18 months?
158
Because that's underwritable.
159
What happens after that is harder for us to underwrite.
160
Yeah, because I guess your, I guess, job is an investment.
161 you're giving them capital, but you're also helping them get the company going, getting in motion.
162
And if it's working really well, there's a long list of VCs that'll come in and happily do all their stuff that they need to do when it's later on down the road.
163
That's right.
164, some people describe it as,, there's the companies that have some traction.
165
A shorthand that many VCs use and many founders use is called product market fit.
166 they have some notion of product market fit.
167
Now I can put some more money in and they can go.
168
And then there are some other investors who look at companies that don't have product market fit with a lot of fear.
169
They're not going to really going to be helpful to a company that doesn't have product market fit because that is a really messy place.
170
Sometimes a founder is looking for a co-founder.
171
Sometimes the co-founders are looking for a great idea.
172
Sometimes they are abandoning multiple ideas.
173
They're in the process of pivoting.
174
And eventually it's a zigzag road.
175
Eventually, they get to two strong founders or three strong founders or even one strong founder gets to a strong idea.
176
And you ideally want to invest just at that point, but reality is if you wait for that long, it may be too late.
177
So some investors wait way after that to invest.
178
Traditionally, a seed or a series A.
179
What we have chosen to do is to go even earlier, is to not wait for that right idea and the right team to come together, but to get to know them way ahead of time.
180
So how would you vet that?
181
So when we're talking about you're trying to find somebody who's going to hit that trajectory point and you meet this really strong technical founder, just how do that they're going to make it and go the distance?
182
Hard to know for sure, but we have some time rules.
183
So for example, some of the things that we use is that we generally invest in technical founders.
184
Generally speaking, they're working on some an idea where the breakthrough is some result of some technological shift, AI being the most common one, but it was SaaS and cloud before mobile and so on.
185
Or they have some a product insight.
186
It may not be an engineering innovation, but it might be a product innovation.
187
As a result of this product, it can create a breakthrough experience for the end user and so on.
188
And they're able to describe it really well.
189
But at the end of the day, when you meet a founder or meet a person, I think you have to decide: are you looking at gold or are you looking at bronze?
190
And our job, I think, on the investor side is to know when we're looking at bronze and know when we're looking at gold.
191
It's generally harder when you're just getting off the ground when you're doing it for the first time.
192
But once you've seen a lot of gold, I think you can tell when you see gold.
193
I think that's that's the maybe that's the dark art that we've gotten good at.
194
Yeah, well, and talk about gold and there's a lot of VCs that,, we look for outlier founders, out of this world founders.
195
Did gold is not made on earth?
196, gold comes from other solar systems.
197
Did this?
198
I didn't realize I thought it was in Sacramento.
199
I'm kidding.
200
So,, yeah, the way that gold works is it's it was created in the universe from, I forget exactly how it's created, but the only way that it's we find in the ground is from asteroids crashing into the earth.
201, because gold, I guess, it's created from different stars colliding and ripping apart.
202
So, there's something I think it's seven, it's 300,000 total or 200,000 total metric, 200,000 metric tons of gold that exists in the entire earth.
203
And we've mined something 150,000 of it.
204
And I think it's, it's all existing gold in the world can fit inside seven mile, square block radius or something that.
205
It's a pretty small amount, right?
206
But it's crazy when you think about how common we talk about gold.
207, you'd think it's just this,,, it is pretty rare to find, though.
208
Yeah.
209
Extremely rare.
210
But it's the point of finding a founder that's going to start a company, build a product, hire a team, convince people to use it.
211
They're going to do a billion dollars in revenue.
212
Extremely rare.
213
And if you think about it, oftentimes, one of the criticisms that are made of seed or pre-seed of stage investing is that it's a lottery ticket.
214
The investors are buying a lottery ticket on a founder.
215
No one knows if it's going to work out or not.
216
It's a pure founder bet.
217
It's a an institutionally lazy way of thinking about investing, which we can talk a little bit more about.
218
But at the core of it, it is an investment in a founder's ability to succeed, their potential, not necessarily at the point of investment, but an investment in their ability to grow, to improve.
219
And we've seen that multiple times across our 200 founders.
220
Founders that we've invested in at the pre-seed, a year and a half goes by at the series A, they look different.
221
In fact, we have a slide from one of our past AGMs, and the slide talks about what a founder looks at the pre-seed stage, what they look at the series A stage, and what they look at the Series B stage.
222
And for each stage, we had a different photo from Jeff Bezos' life.
223
When he was the doorkeeper founder starting Amazon in a garage or library, whatever.
224
And then when he wore a suit and he was IPOing, and then finally what he looks now, Buff made it.
225
We've seen that.
226
It literally founders go through that metamorphosis.
227
And that's the imagination part of investing in our stage, is being able to see this movie.
228
So that's why sometimes I think of our business as a movie making business, where we invest in a founder, but we're imagining a story of how this founder can grow and how the market can grow and so on and so forth.
229
And we see this repeatedly.
230
So it's to invest at our stage, it requires to be able to see what's gold and what's bronze, but bronze, but also being able to imagine what things can become in the future.
231, that doesn't always work out, but that's the hope.
232
That's the reason why I think investing at our stage benefits the optimist.
233
So, you said something interesting, you're, oh, we can revisit this.
234
You said it's lazy to think of it as just option bets or whatever.
235
Why, why do you think that?
236
Because that is a pretty common view, I feel the way that a lot of people describe it.
237
I guess there are two ways to two thoughts there.
238
One is typically an investor, not always, many investors think of the preceding investor as traditionally the criticism for seed investors have been they don't really know too much about the business.
239
They didn't really contribute much to the business, they just gave some money, they gave some money, they got lucky, they found a founder, they gave them 250K, yeah, and they built Uber, yeah.
240
And then, and then that's it, and then it's the institutional investor in Sandhill Road that comes in and sorts stuff out.
241
They are the ones who are really helping build the business, and there's some truth to that.
242
They do a lot of work, but so the criticism has been that these are these are folks who are who are not serious investors and they're there and they are and they're writing small checks.
243
But as we know, that that's not true.
244, these investors, that was the way they got started because that was the only way they could get started.
245
And then they have built amazing portfolios, the seed funds that many of them I talked about are just amazing.
246
And they have institutionalized seed.
247
And I believe that's what's happening to pre-seed now.
248
It's getting institutionalized, and that's the reason why today, nine years into a forced life cycle, four funds in almost every fund that every fund has a pre-seed strategy, or there's someone in the fund who's believes in it.
249
It's just a life cycle, a life cycle of things.
250
On the option bet side, I think if you're a larger fund and you have billions to deploy, writing 500K checks is not that meaningful of a needle mover.
251
However, it would seem an option strategy from that perspective.
252
It is, however, very strategic.
253
Some funds realize this.
254
It is very strategic not to lose sight of the formation stage of companies.
255
So what they typically do is the easiest thing to do is to write small checks into a number of companies.
256
It's usually the junior people who get to write those checks.
257
And if some of those things work, then they get to be senior people in those funds.
258
These deals are generally with the little boy in the little boys' table.
259
They don't usually make it to the big boys' table.
260
And even if it doesn't work out, it's not a problem because it's not a lot of money.
261
But some of them do, and some funds execute it really well.
262
What's any examples of funds executing it well from your perspective?
263
I don't know the exact stats.
264
So the stat to look at is how many of if seed funds, seed investments have converted to that fund series A.
265 an inside round.
266
That's right.
267
So the option, that quote unquote, in the seed, you do a 500K check and then you do a three, four, or maybe $20 million seed bet nowadays.
268
It's either that, it's a conversion.
269
So it wasn't an option bet.
270
It was a real investment.
271
They spent time with it.
272
They helped.
273
And then many of them graduated to a proper series A.
274
It's either that or they didn't spray and pray at the seed stage.
275
They wrote large checks, meaningful checks, and they spent quite a bit of time and they didn't do that many.
276, if you look at, I think Index as track record at seed is pretty good.
277
I think they're in Figma and a bunch of other companies right at the seed stage.
278
They were pretty meaningful.
279
I've heard the same stats about Spark.
280
I think their conversion rates are really high.
281
What's a good conversion rate?
282
Are we talking 10%?
283
No, I think it's 90%.
284
I don't know if it's 90 or not, but it's got to be more than 10%.
285
It's probably 30, 40%.
286
That's probably a pretty good conversion rate from seed to series A inside of the fund.
287
But nowadays, I think there's a trend here where Series A funds and stage agnostic funds are taking significant ownership at the seed stage.
288
So they are writing the two, three, four, five million dollar check at the seed stage.
289
In a way, that's is it a seed?
290
I don't know if it's a, is it a five, six million dollar round?
291
Is it a seed round?
292
Anyway, maybe it's a small series A, yeah.
293
But, they're aiming for 10, 7 to 15% ownership.
294
That's a significant investment.
295
Yeah.
296
So one question, one other question on this early, early company phase, early in the journey for founders.
297
What have you noticed that a lot of the best founders maybe or not the best founders mess up on?
298, are there any common mistakes that you feel are pretty avoidable?
299
And you just feel founders,, they hear you say this and you're going to save them a ton of pain.
300
I think a common mistake is the way they run their fundraising process for either the seed or the series A.
301
Typically,, all of them want to do a preemptive, which is no fundraising and they get term sheets.
302
And it's just, it's an oxymoron.
303
They want to run a preemptive process, which doesn't make any sense.
304, why would you run a process to get preempted?
305
Yeah.
306
Because preemption basically means you didn't run a process at all.
307
So, one of the mistakes I commonly find founders make is you either run a process to fundraise or you do not run a process to fundraise.
308
The halfway house of I'm meeting with one or two funds to see to test the market, to see how it goes.
309
And then I might decide what ends up happening in those cases for companies that are doing well and founders that are strong is those one or two funds end up giving the founder a term sheet.
310
And the term sheet may or may not be the best that they could get, but they have a bird in hand and no other options.
311
And the other option is to try to fundraise over the next month or so.
312
They may or may not get anything.
313
So now they're in a bind.
314
Do I take it or do I roll the dice and try?
315
And usually, when they get an offer, which is okay, they usually end up taking it, which may be suboptimal for the company.
316
So that's a mistake, I think.
317
And then, so the way to mitigate that is just have your spreadsheet of 50 people, you email them all, set up a meeting.
318
How long should that process usually take?
319
It's a first commitment to the process.
320
Many founders, I think, struggle to commit to the process because it is all-encompassing.
321
It takes the best case, is maybe a few weeks, best case.
322
Worst case is three months, and no fundraising happens.
323
And I think it's worrisome.
324
I think we see one of our jobs as investors in the company is to secure the follow-on, is to ensure that the follow-on happens very smoothly.
325
And our track record on that is pretty good.
326
I think our companies have raised about $3 billion after us.
327
So for every dollar a four puts in, 39x follows our companies.
328
And we are able to help raise 64% of that.
329
So, introductions, of the $3 billion that have been raised, 64% of the introductions came from a four.
330
So, we play a helping hand, a guiding hand in how that happens.
331
But general feedback is to get to know investors well ahead of time because you're asking for a lot of money.
332
You're asking for a lot.
333
If you don't give them enough time, it's really not fair on them.
334
So, get to know them, let them get to know you.
335
And then, when you run a process, run a really tight process and commit to it and assume that the business might slow down during that time.
336
When you say tight process, what does a tight process look?
337
Because people might have different ideas of what that should be.
338
Yeah, it's usually start with some time that you commit to raising money.
339
It's a sales process.
340
You have a goal of risk, let's say, raising 10 million, and you think it might take about six weeks or so.
341
And so, you have to, you should have a week-by-week plan.
342
And a week-by-week plan is you start putting together your deck, you talk to your insiders, you get introductions, you meet with those investors, you quickly triage who's really interested and who's not, and you move it forward.
343
You figure out who to give customer references to, what the customer should say.
344
You plan that out.
345
You work your network to make sure there's a whisper network for you amongst your insiders and angels.
346
So, what does that mean?
347
How does that play out?
348
The whisper network is basically you're trying to, your fundraising really starts when you get your first term sheet.
349
Up until that point, it's just mechanics.
350
And at that point, the whisper network helps you get introductions.
351
And then, second, it helps investors learn more about you that they may not be able to ask you.
352
And you want to make sure that everyone in your circle knows that, knows what you what you want the talking points to be in a in a in a pretty authentic way, but a direct way how do you do that as a funder you're trying to figure out which investors are really leaning in who are really really interested who are looking who what information are they looking for usually if if if if Investors are pretty independent in the way they think.
353
If they hear from a customer, for example, that you are doing well, that's the right whisper network to go through, which is let your customers know that you are fundraising.
354
And if they are really satisfied with your product, if they're looking to spend more money on your product and so on, they should say that to investors.
355
If you have angels or others who are, you should figure out who are close to which funds, which people are close to which funds, who has influence over which funds and what they're willing to say about you.
356
And game planning that, I think, is really beneficial.
357
So do you recommend then saying,, if I'm an investor, do you recommend having Turner just randomly text someone and be, hey, this company's fundraising.
358, they're doing pretty well.
359
You should invest.
360, how should I probably nudge my investors to do that?
361
If I'm if I'm pre-seed, looking to raise my A.
362
How do I tactically?
363
Yeah.
364
I guess two steps.
365
First step is the introduction.
366
And so first step is get the meeting.
367
It's secure the interview.
368
At the interview, there's not much more you can do as an investor if the interview fails.
369
So the founder has to impress.
370
So you got to help the founder prepare.
371
And to, and the goal of the first meeting with the investor is to get to a second meeting.
372
And the goal of the second meeting is to get to a third meeting.
373
And the third meeting, they get to a fourth meeting.
374
Different investors have different paths.
375
It could become a partner meeting pretty quickly.
376
It couldn't.
377
I think the job for an investor is to be able to have an authentic relationship with the follow-on investor.
378 our job is to have an authentic relationship with Series Investors, seed investors.
379
And if they call us, we tell them exactly what's going on in the best honest way possible.
380
So for example, so we wouldn't nag or bug an investor to invest because that's a sign of weakness.
381
If I'm, if I, after the introduction, if I'm telling someone, please invest, then they're not going to invest.
382
Yeah.
383
That immediately says, okay, there's a weakness.
384
Yeah, there's a weakness.
385
There's a problem.
386
Yeah.
387, why?
388
So, so it should, it should always be from the other side.
389
We are receiving calls as opposed to making them.
390
And when they, when we are receiving the calls, the call is, hey, I'm leaning in.
391
Are they really moving as fast as they're saying?
392
Do I have time or no?
393
And we tell them the truth.
394
Do they have time or do they not have time?
395
And sometimes they come back and say, hey, I'm really, I'm leaning into making an offer.
396
The founder might, does the founder have crazy expectations?
397
If so, what is it?
398
What is it?
399
The question on valuation becomes a little tricky because we don't want to, that's for the founder and the investor to decide, not for us.
400
Yeah.
401
The way that usually plays out is the team might have an idea of how much money they want to raise.
402
And typically in a certain round, you'll sell a certain percentage of the business.
403
So you might say, we're going to raise 10 to 12 million and we're going to sell 20 to 18 to 25 percent of the company.
404
So that gives you a range of, okay, the valuation might be 40 to 60 million, which is a pretty big range.
405
I don't think founders should ever say indicate at all, ever, what the valuation should be.
406
Okay.
407
It is, it is, it does them no good because they're negotiating against themselves because they're never going to get a valuation larger than what they've just signaled.
408
It's if they, for example, if they say I'm raising a million on 10, if the investor wanted to invest at 15 posts, they're never going to, they're never going to say 15 anymore.
409
So, so that's 50, 33% dilution, extra dilution that the funder is going to suffer.
410
And that matters.
411
So, should you be bold with the amount that you want to raise?
412, I want to raise 10 million bucks.
413
Of course.
414
Of course.
415
But then there might only be 5% dilution in the round.
416
That depends on the competition.
417
So, for example, if you say you're raising 10 million, as a founder's job, should be to have as many options as possible.
418
Whether that's the right thing for the company, and then pick the best option, not necessarily the highest valuation, but the best option.
419
And then the price is part of that, but not the entirety of it.
420, I often see sometimes in other fundraising, fundraising mistakes, is in founders deck, they will say exactly what the cap is or what the post money is.
421
So, the founder's job is to indicate how much they're raising.
422
It is the investor's job to indicate what price they feel comfortable at.
423
And it's up to the funder to decide if they want to take that price or not.
424
And there is a concept of laddering up.
425
Are you familiar with laddering up?
426, I've heard the term, but laddering up of around.
427
So, let's say the founder's real aim is to raise 10 million.
428
Okay.
429
But they think if they come out of the gate with 10 million, ask, they're not going to get it.
430
So, what they do is they start with five to six million and they get a term sheet or something at six.
431
And then that generates competition, and that might end up being a $9 million round, which is which was close to their original target.
432
Sometimes it's even more.
433
There are some dynamics here that founders sometimes think about, but sometimes don't.
434
But I realize why many founders don't know all of these things, because especially if you're raising for the first time, you don't know how this works.
435
So that's why working with a good investor is a really good idea who's seen multiple turns.
436
But sometimes, but founders get so smart so quickly.
437 after they've raised their pre-seed, they're so much smarter at the seed, so much smarter at the series A, so much smarter at the subsequent rounds.
438
That's another way people develop really fast.
439
Interesting.
440
So the laddering up, how do you pull that off?
441
Because,, you might say, I want to raise 5 million bucks.
442
And somebody likes you.
443
If you're raising 10, you more fit in their box.
444
And they just say, oh, I don't really want to meet you.
445
It's not a fit for me.
446
Just, how do you, how do you navigate just pulling off that ladder up move?
447
Yeah, I think it's a function of competition.
448
So the substance has to be good.
449
You have to have a good story.
450
You have to have some traction.
451
And the founding team has to be really strong.
452
They must really present well in their idea.
453
And then the job is really to ensure that no one is, no one is, no one opts out.
454
No investor opts out.
455
So the top of funnel has to be really high.
456
So you want seed investors and you want series A investors because we're talking about the area between seed and series A, which can be really vague.
457
And you want to take advantage of that vagueness because there are some hard lines, but for you, for the investment, basically for the founder, is that the point here is that if you're raising a seed, let's say 4 million or something, it is for, and you're willing to give up 20%, 15%, 25%, whatever the dilution amount is, it is always better to raise more for the same dilution than less.
458
So if you could raise 10 instead of 4, why shouldn't you?
459
If you could raise 7 instead of four, why shouldn't you?
460
If you could raise more, why shouldn't you?
461
Because the issue is that if you raise three or four, you're going to have to raise 12 again or 15 in about a year's time.
462
Why give up that extra 10%?
463
So basically, either raise as little as possible, give up as little of the company as possible, or raise as much as possible for the same amount of dilution.
464
And I don't know if you've mentioned it in this conversation, but before you talk to me a lot,, oh, I had a portfolio company that skipped the seed.
465
They went straight to series A.
466
Is that an element of this?
467, what exactly does that mean, skipping a seed and going to A?
468
Yeah, seed strapping, it's called.
469
That's the thing, the term now.
470
That's right.
471
That's the term now.
472
That's one of the value props for our fund is when we first started as a pre-seed fund.
473
We would invest anywhere from 500K to a million dollars into companies that are pre-launch, pre-traction, pre-anything.
474
And then what we found is the moment they got any traction, they could raise a large round, $5 to $10 million.
475
So roughly the way it worked is,, companies would raise a million dollars, and then in about 10 months, they could raise $5 to $10 million.
476
So if they could do that, why not raise more as opposed to less?
477
And that meant in the five, if you're able to raise $5 to $10 million, essentially you've skipped the seed round.
478
You've skipped $3 million or $4 million, et cetera.
479
And we began to see that across our portfolio multiple times.
480
Modern Health, Hide Touch, SEAL, New Lantern, you just name it, all of them, a ton of them.
481, 64% of our companies that we've invested in across fund one and fund two skipped the seed and went straight to a series A.
482
So, this is of your first checks, 64% that raised skipped the seed, or 64% went directly to a Series A.
483
Of every single company or just the one?
484
Every single company that was raising.
485
They were raising either a seed or a series A, and 64% of them ended up raising a series A.
486
And that's impressive for somebody who might not know because you have to sell part of the company, correct?
487
And you've,, you've saved 10% on dilution.
488
You've saved 10% of the company for yourself by skipping a stage.
489
Which is always good.
490
Because the end of the day, the math is when the company exits, how much of the company does the founder own?
491
Right?
492
And the less you sell along the way, the more you own.
493
So I had a question.
494
This is from Derek on your team.
495
He was wondering, how do you measure obsession in a founder?
496
I know that's a big thing you guys look for.
497
Yeah, it's a good question.
498
I think Derek's probably pretty good at measuring that, maybe more so than me.
499
I think one of the reasons, by the way, we look for obsession is because starting companies, as, it's pretty hard.
500
More things go wrong than right.
501
You get a lot of rejection.
502
You get rejections from investors.
503
You get rejection from customers.
504
You get rejections across the board from everybody.
505
Candidates.
506
Yeah.
507, yeah, you lose people.
508
It's crazy to even think of starting because most things don't go right.
509
I'm assuming anyone who starts a company, any successful startup founder, you could easily go make mid to high six figures, maybe seven figures, just making money, just working 40 hours a week.
510
That's right.
511
Starting a company is not the right way to make money.
512
If the goal is to make money, you got to be a little bit off.
513
That's right.
514
So, but at the same time, a lot of people do really, really well as founders.
515, we hear about stories of IPOs and how much company, how much founders own we have.
516
Our role models are founders Jeff Bezos, Mark, Zuckerberg, and so on.
517
So, everybody wants to be that.
518
We worship at the altar of founders.
519
So, that attracts a lot of folks, but not all of these folks are going to make it.
520
And so, the question for us is: who do we think is going to make it?
521
One of the traits we look for is obsession.
522
Obsession, one of the reasons we look for that is that even when things are going wrong, because they're so obsessed with what they're working on, they're going to figure out a way.
523
I think one of the things we realized with investing in founders this early is that we look for obsession and resilience.
524
The human ability to get up when you fall down is resilience, and that allows you to continue and persevere because you should be willing to persevere against all odds by believing in yourself, believing in your team.
525
And that means an obsession in your craft.
526 when you get knocked down, figure out a way to motivate yourself to get back up again because you are so obsessed with this idea.
527
Is it obsession with a problem, a customer, an idea?
528
It varies.
529
It could be just an obsession with success.
530
It could be, I want to succeed in some way.
531
It could be an obsession with a market and an idea.
532
I'll give you an example.
533
There's a company called New Lantern.
534
They're in the radiology space.
535
They introduced AI in radiology.
536
Instead of replacing the radiologist, what they're doing is they're helping the radiologist do their jobs faster.
537
So in an x-ray, they do automatic measurements of the tumor, automatic measurements of the fracture.
538
And they, so that The radiology doesn't painstakingly have to do that measurement manually.
539
Yeah, I was going to say, don't they literally just look at it and decide with their eyes what it looks?
540
They use a screen sometimes with two pointers to put one pointer in one part of the fracture, one for another part of the fracture, and the machine tells them the reading.
541
It takes some time, it's not hard, but it just has to be done.
542
It's manual.
543
Now, there are vision models that make it really, really fast.
544
And then once they find it, so if the machine does it for them, it's just much faster for them to verify.
545
And then they have to scribe what they just found.
546
They have to prepare a report, and the report goes to the doctor.
547
That also takes time.
548
And if those things, those administrators take time, it takes time, it just slows them down.
549
And they have to view all of these images in this tool called the PAX.
550
It's an old school hardware software combo that large enterprises G sells to hospitals.
551
So this founder, Shiva, used to work at Confluent before.
552
His mom was a radiologist.
553
He went home during COVID and realized his mom had to go to work to see these x-rays and do these manual stuff.
554
Why can't I know software?
555
Why can't I just build it?
556
So he built the PAX on the cloud.
557
So you can basically look at it or look at X-ray on your iPad.
558
And he sold it, but he ran into a lot of challenges when he tried to go to the hospitals and private practices and so on, because the pushback was,, what do about radiology?
559
And I'm not going to switch over from my PAX to this.
560
But he realized this is the future.
561
This is going to happen.
562
It's a matter of time.
563
And he just bided his time until the chat GPT moment arrived and a bunch of models open source, both on the vision side as well as on the tech side.
564
He embodied all of that to do this automatic measurements and automatic scribing, package it together into the PACs.
565
And now he's off to the races.
566 Benchmark led his Series A late last year.
567
He's got a pipeline that he can't deal with right now.
568
He has to hire salespeople.
569
Now investors want to meet him because they believe in the PAC story.
570
It was exact replica of the reason investors rejected him a while ago before the CIs are now the same reason that they want to invest now.
571
And that's an example of obsession because he believed in this future.
572
He believed in his ability to put a team together.
573
He believed that this is going to exist and he's going to build it.
574
Who knows what happens in the future, but that's just an example of someone with outstanding ability and belief in themselves.
575
Yes, when you say,, who knows what's going to happen in the future?
576
So I know you guys do follow on sometimes.
577
How do?
578 in this case, this round, or maybe in other cases, how do you vet out if you should be following on as a fund?
579
Because there's,, the return to be made by following on.
580
It's not a perfect mechanism for us.
581
We do get it wrong sometimes, but we've had the benefit of working with these founders pretty closely for months, for years sometimes before we have to make that decision.
582
So we can, basically, our job is to figure out if there is an upward slope here.
583
Is the slope rising?
584
Are the founders' abilities rising?
585
The market getting better.
586
Is the traction getting better?
587
Is the prospects of the company getting easier and better or not?
588
And then our question is, do we protect our priority?
589
Do we protect our position?
590
Do we invest more or not?
591
And the question,, for us, those questions aren't that hard.
592
Our ownerships are quite healthy up front.
593
Our fund is, we're able to invest in the Series A and the Series B, but probably not much beyond that.
594
We want to continue supporting our companies.
595
The question really is, I think the more interesting question is: as these companies get even larger, even bigger, and they're raising, and we have the opportunity to invest tens of millions in subsequent rounds, partly as a result of our broader rights, but partly as a result of our relationships.
596
Should we make those very, very large investments or not?
597
Growth investments, if you will.
598
So far, we've stayed away from that.
599
So far, we haven't done that.
600
But those are really large follow-up decisions.
601
Yeah, how do you figure out the one or two things that really matter in a business?
602
So I don't know if you have any examples maybe to help drive this one for people, but just how do what drives a needle?
603
Because there's so many different things you can look at, but usually there's one, two, maybe three things.
604
Yeah, I think generally speaking, founders should be working on an interesting trend.
605
There's some wave that helps them succeed.
606
And I think, I guess, two other things that matter is that their product is different, is breakthrough.
607
For the folks who use it, there is lightning in a bottle.
608, how do if it's lightning in a bottle or not?
609, how do if it's truly customers tell you that?
610
I think users who end up using it testify to it.
611
When you talk to them, they'll tell you because they've looked at a bunch of options.
612
They don't really care about investing.
613
They don't care about tech.
614
They don't care about VCs.
615
They don't cover any of that.
616
They just care if it makes their lives easier or not.
617
Is it something that they want?
618
What else have they looked at?
619
And is their willingness to spend even more?
620
And that, so that's even that is not enough because that might be, it might be not as many companies might do that, or that may not be enough of a share of wallet.
621
It's a necessary step.
622
I think the thing to think about is that, does the founder have the ability to identify even larger markets over time?
623
Are they so ambitious that they're not satisfied with this success?
624
They want even more success.
625
They want to make an even bigger dent.
626
They want to find adjacent markets, adjacent products.
627
That's the entrepreneurial instinct that we look for, which is do they have a nose for opportunity?
628
And is that sixth sense getting stronger over time or not?
629
Yeah, so a little bit of a different topic, but I'm curious.
630
You guys started this program maybe two years ago, maybe three years ago.
631
It's called the Founder in Residence Program.
632
What exactly is that for people who aren't familiar?
633
Yeah, for sure.
634
So, Founder in Residence is a residency in San Francisco.
635
It's a very bespoke custom program that we run for five to eight founders, five to eight teams who spend quality time with us up to two months, and then sometimes even longer.
636
And they work right alongside us, working on either figuring out their idea, finding a co-founder, or trying to get their first set of customers.
637
Essentially, in the two-month time, they figure out what they're trying to build.
638
The reason it's called Founder in Residence is borrowed from the entrepreneur in residence program that many venture funds run that I was a part of at Foundation Capital.
639
They were very kind enough to have me on as an EIR.
640
You basically get access to an entire venture fund.
641
You get to see many, many companies, all the ideas that are pouring through the walls, and then you get to tune and improve your own idea, find a team, and then capital comes baked with it.
642
Some people think,, some people compare that to an accelerator, and ours is not an accelerator.
643
We're not trying to accelerate anything.
644
We think every founder is a beautiful snowflake, and we are trying to improve and provide bespoke custom help.
645
An example of that is, let's say there are five to eight founders, they're working on five or eight different areas, and each week each one of them are twisting and turning about the customers they want to talk to.
646
One day it could be customers in a BUB space, another one it could be a hardware space.
647
Our job is to put together a roster of interviews for them that they can talk to customers of different types on a weekly basis to figure out: is this the right product?
648
Is this the right market?
649
Is this the right segment or not?
650
Or twist and turn.
651
It's hard to do that if you are working with 400 founders, let's say.
652
But it is possible if it's just five to eight or under 10 because we're willing to commit a lot of time to these founders.
653
So, what are the terms normally?
654
Yeah, so it's nothing standard.
655
And the reason we, by the way, we came up with this idea is because we found that when we're investing in pre-seed, many founders are looking for validation from us.
656
If we invest, they will work on this idea.
657
But they are not really committed to the idea in the first place.
658
They are willing to pivot and change.
659
So, they are still going through the journey, the ideation, they're still going to the idea maze.
660
Some of them, if we invest, they are going to be able to convince their friend to quit and start with them.
661
So, they're trying to raise funding to secure a co-founder.
662
So, funding comes as a band-aid for other issues.
663
So, we said, why don't we, even though our fund sizes got larger, we went from a $47 million fund one to currently, $185 million fund, a fourth fund, the increased capital is going to be deployed even earlier.
664
So, we said that this is time and space for founders who are thinking about leaving, thinking about quitting, pulling in their co-founders, going through this ideation journey that might take six months, eight months, one year, two months, who knows?
665
And there's no product for them.
666
Because most, because accelerators need you to have two committed full-time founders working on a concrete idea to get started.
667
That's when they intersect.
668
Because their product is almost a demo day.
669 their product is not.
670
It is demo day.
671
They do a lot of help also.
672
They have a community, they have customers, all that stuff.
673
Some of them are better than others.
674
Yeah.
675
But ultimately, you need to be ready to go.
676
You can't be fickle.
677
And you can't be vulnerable.
678
So we felt that founders needed a safe space.
679
And we liked the invention phase.
680
We liked the ideation phase.
681
And then we wanted to work with them, but we wanted to work with them in a different way under very little pressure.
682
And for that, it meant that we had to iterate that we've done about seven cohorts, two years.
683
We tried many different terms.
684
One time we did a standard term that wasn't so great.
685
Then we did non-standard terms.
686
And one of the things we realized is that generally it comes with about 200,000 to about 800,000 or so in investment.
687
And the ownership can range from just a couple of percentage points to six, seven percent.
688
It's very bespoke.
689
It's custom.
690
Primarily, what we're looking for is really, really interesting people.
691
And we'll invest even if we don't the idea.
692
In fact, that's what we look for.
693
We would want to invest in amazing founders who we believe will get to the right idea eventually, or we can help them get to the right idea.
694
So, you feel basically this type of program, it almost gives them a veil around,, or maybe not, maybe a veil is not the right term, but it gives them the cover almost to commit to I'm going to try to build something, but not feeling they have to be tied to a certain idea because, and you're, it's upfront saying,, we're investing in this AI software thing, this thesis that you have, but we, the whole program is about iterating and trying to get to a get to a form factor or get to something that solves a problem for a customer without saying you have to do what the DAC said.
695
Yeah, it's more real.
696
It's what it recognizes and respects where founders are really at in their ideation process.
697
They've been trained by accelerators to pitch something concrete.
698
Here's my idea.
699
Here's my founder.
700
I'm going to start.
701
But many of them know that that's not the idea that you really believe in, or their founder may or may not be committed.
702
They're just trying to see because they know that this is what is expected behavior.
703
And so they're going to fake it.
704
Not all of them do, but some of them do.
705
Because that's the training that accelerators are provided.
706
We're trying to unpack that and be more honest and say, it is okay for you not to have an idea or for us to invest in an idea that we may not.
707
And because that's reality.
708
We know that from some of our most successful companies, High Touch, for example, they went through five pivots before they found the right thing.
709
They were originally a travel startup.
710
They ended up becoming a data, modern data stack company, completely different, right?
711
But it's just reality.
712
We just recognize that reality and we're open with it.
713
So what role do accelerators play?
714
Because, there's so many of them.
715
Yeah.
716
I think there's a big role to be played.
717
It is a great choice for many types of founders, especially maybe international founders, founders who need their first rung to get into the system.
718
And many of them provide a lot of value with their network and so on.
719
But we're looking for a different type of founder, I guess.
720
We're providing a different option to the founders.
721
And I think one of the good things is that while accelerators, large funds, entrepreneurship programs such as ourselves, we provide options for founders.
722
So founders should really do their research to figure out what is right for them.
723
And it's awesome just when you just step back and think about it, where 20 years ago, there's a couple things out there versus today, there's 100.
724
So if you're a founder, you have a lot of choices.
725
It's still hard, but there's more options to design.
726
I just think roughly that's good.
727 there's more competition.
728
Every investor has to improve their product that they give to founders.
729
And that's good.
730
Yeah, that's right.
731, one of the things that used to be said is that there are only 10 companies in a year that make it.
732
That matter.
733
That matter and stuff that.
734
I bet there are more than that.
735
And I bet if you offer more, I bet there are just as amazing founders that are not getting capital today that might deserve it, but they don't have access.
736
And I think accelerators, us, others, venture in general provides greater access.
737
And that access has increased quite a bit.
738
Other criticism that many people make, especially LPs make of GPs is that they have too many funds, which is true.
739
There are too many funds relative to when funds first started 10 years ago or so.
740
But at the same time, there are way too many, way more founders than there are funds.
741
So for as long as there are more founders and there are funds, I think we're going to be good.
742
Yeah.
743
And the point is, you can make an argument of,, a lot of funds, they make bad investments and just only make good investments.
744
And then there'd be way fewer funds.
745
But that's not really how it works.
746
Cause everything we just talked about, it's hard to know which universe of,, out of the whole universe of founders, which specific ones are going to go on and build a company that does billions in revenue and returns the industry.
747 it's a pretty, there's a pretty high hurdle rate or low hurdle rate at conversion rate between rounds to the point, it's hard to know.
748
Yeah, because there are way more failures than there are successes, but that doesn't matter because the successes are unbounded.
749
It's going to be so, so big.
750
So it's our industry's oriented incentivized to take risk and to make failure acceptable and to allow founders to retry.
751
That's unique.
752
That's very different.
753
And I think that's very American also, because American consumers are willing to take risk on new products.
754
American businesses are willing to take risk on new products.
755
And even if it fails, they don't give up.
756
They keep going.
757
I think it's a natural one of the reasons I came to America.
758
I love this is because it's just everyone is willing to take risk.
759
They're willing to try.
760
And that allows for new things to happen.
761
Something that wouldn't happen anywhere else.
762
Yeah.
763
So I want to talk to you about coming to America, but I have maybe one or two other things to hit on because otherwise it won't make sense to throw these in later.
764
So how do you think with there's been a lot of funds, a multi-stage, later stage fund that tries to create an accelerator program?
765, I think, I think I saw recently there was a LinkedIn post.
766
There was 30 different accelerators they listed.
767
And I hadn't heard of,, 10 of them.
768
There's just so many.
769
How has that played out?
770
And what do you think is going to happen?
771
Yeah.
772
As we on my way here, I was driving past Townsend Street and Andreessen's offices.
773
And I don't know if you noticed, but they advertise Speedrun on the Windows.
774
Really?
775
And so Speedrun is their, I believe, their accelerator.
776
I don't know if that's the right term, but I think they've been quite successful with it.
777
It seems it, yeah.
778
And there's just one, PAIR has an amazing program.
779
I think NEO has an amazing program.
780
And there's a bunch of others that have programs.
781
I think, in a way, our founder in residence program, we're expanding it even more.
782
We have a new program called Founder in Residence U, F-I-R-U, going after universities, college students.
783
So going even earlier.
784
And others are doing something similar.
785
So the question is: are these going to be successful?
786
Why is this happening?
787
What is causing it?
788
And so on.
789
I have a take on this, which is a stage agnostic fund.
790
So basically, nobody wants to lose formation stage companies.
791
Nobody wants to lose founders at the seed stage.
792 getting that first check into a business.
793
Yeah, I guess I shouldn't say nobody.
794
I should say traditional, many traditional Series A funds who invest in true venture, so not growth, on later stage, so through true venture, they're taking a lot of early stage risk, don't want to lose sight of seed stage.
795
Don't want to lose sight of formation stage because they don't want to be, because if you lose that, then you are one amongst 20 VCs trying to vie for a deal.
796
And if that's what you're doing.
797
So many of them have decided that we can't lose it.
798
So historically, they've had seed programs.
799
And seed programs historically have been promoted by younger people at those funds because they are close to the metal.
800
They're seeing that the best deals are going to these angels and the seed funds and they're getting disintermediated.
801
So they start these seed funds and seed funds have gone through cycles.
802
Seed funds sometimes get, and then founders realize that many seed deals do not convert to Series A.
803
So they avoid these stage agnostic funds and their seed funds grow and then they collapse and they grow and then they collapse.
804
That has happened over cycles for a long time.
805 for example, I think Greylock had a fund called Discovery Fund, Discovery Seed Fund a while ago.
806
Now they have something else.
807
So sometimes funds and young people leave.
808
Anyway, so the Series A funds have tried for a long time to penetrate seed.
809
And one of the things that was fine for them is that even if you don't have your own seed program, you have YC or you have Techstars or any of others, just go to their demo days and pick up the good ones.
810
Yeah, and there's some good deal flows.
811
There's great deals.
812
This makes sense for everybody.
813
You don't know which company is going to be in unicorn, but, I think they have stats at the YC that some of the companies are going to be unicorn.
814
If you index well enough, you'll probably do well.
815
Yeah, and there's a ton of them.
816 you just go to YC Demo Day and there's 100 companies.
817
That's right.
818
Why do your own, why waste time on it yourself when you can just show up for a couple hours and there's a menu.
819 here's the option.
820
And the cool thing was that back a while ago, you don't have to wait for the demo day.
821 you can get access to those companies before demo day and you can make deals there.
822
Or even if you wait for a demo day, it's not that bad because you can get it at, you can get decent ownership and so at, 15 posts, 10 posts, and so on and so forth.
823
And one of the things that I think I realized that YC has done is to say that we are going to make sure that these companies wait for demo day and they introduced some changes which were found they were given and they were priced at about 1.8 post once first check first check 120k at 1.8 post so you give up seven percent for 120k and then they and then and i think you get another 375 or something on an mfn so that 375 the founders are are incentivized to raise at as high a price as possible because there's there's no valuation on those dollars correct mfn means mfn means that the founder whatever price is set by an external investor the 375 additional investment from yc would convert at that price yep mfn is most favored nation it basically means you get the best terms anyone else gives you or something is generally right so the founders are incentivized at demo day to raise at a high price yeah basically is what it is so these prices that were at 10 15 12 back in the day now began to go up to 20 25 35 40 even and so and so many seed funds who were who were reliant on deals from yc saw their in input price our entry price suddenly shoot up and the question for them is what do we do yeah because if you say your average entry point is 10 million posts on a yc deal it suddenly goes up to 40, you basically cut your returns by 75 percent so if you're going to say,, we're doing all these yc deals, we got a 4x return on our fund, everything's good.
824
Suddenly, with the new entry prices, you're getting 1X on your fund, and that's not good.
825
That's right.
826
So for an investor on the outside, right?
827
And similarly, for a Series A stage-agnostic investor, your entry prices have just gone up, right?
828
So that's one dynamic.
829
And the second dynamic is for many founders, that accelerator deal is great.
830
7% for 120K and then 375, that's great.
831
And YC does give you a little bit of a halo, some brand value.
832, they do a ton of programming and help you learn about building a company.
833 I think YC in particular, they stand out, no question about it.
834 look at the roster of companies that they've invested in.
835
Every funder wants to be part of that.
836
No question about that.
837
Probably better than every fund, venture fund.
838
Oh, exercise.
839
That's a great list.
840
At the same time, there are some founders who may want a better option, who may not believe that their company is worth 1.8 post.
841
And they should have an option.
842
So these investors saw, I think, that our entry prices are going up.
843
If we invest at Demo Day and these founders are entering these accelerators at 1.8 post, there has to be a price in the middle that we can offer.
844
Yeah, give them 10, 10 million posts.
845
Correct.
846
And they started, that's why they started their accelerators to say, let us give you another option.
847
And as a result, what's happening is founders now have more choice.
848
So, the question now becomes: what do the best founders decide to do?
849
Now that they have more options, what are they going to pick?
850
And so, it makes a lot of sense to me to see these other funds try their own programs.
851
And if they're committed and focused and they're able to source and market well, they're going to do really well.
852
As they do really well, that's going to create a positive virtuous cycle for many future founders to decide which one should they pick now.
853
They have better options.
854
So, it's just going to get more competitive.
855
And I would say might have been started because of the change in the original deal.
856
If the deal hadn't changed, would we see so much downstream impact?
857
I don't know.
858
So, what would you do if you were starting a fund or had a fund and were thinking,, I should start an accelerator?
859
How would you approach it?
860, would you even do it?
861, you guys, something different, but how did you do it?
862, I wouldn't do it now, but if I were to start a fund today,, one of the things I would do is that I would funnel founders to these accelerators.
863
And I would cut a deal.
864, if I would cut a deal before them, I would cut a deal.
865
I would cut a deal, I wouldn't price it.
866
I would just do an MFN.
867
I would say, here's 50K, 100K, MFN.
868
My job is to get you into accelerator of your choice.
869
And I think I'd do really well if I did that.
870
So, before we talk a little bit more about how you started a four and all that stuff, your journey, do you think, what do you think is going to happen with AI?
871
We haven't talked about AI.
872
We're, I don't know, 45 minutes in, an hour into this.
873
And somehow, how can we-C's?
874
We haven't talked about AI yet.
875
How do you think AI is changing how people are building companies?
876
Yeah, and we've seen this in our portfolio today.
877
We see AI companies in our portfolio get to a million in revenue at 20% of the burden of a non-AI company.
878
We have a company in our portfolio called Gamma.
879
Oh, that's in the portfolio?
880
Yeah, yeah.
881
We're one of the early original investors in the company.
882
I just talked to Grant.
883
Oh, yeah.
884
I DMed him on Twitter.
885
I was, hey, you want to come on my podcast sometime?
886
Oh, he came on my podcast, by the way.
887
Did he really?
888
Wow.
889
Yeah, yeah.
890
Oh,, I saw that.
891
Yeah, he's pretty good.
892
He's amazing.
893
Okay.
894
So they build, basically, for everyone who doesn't know, they build slideshows or they're the Microsoft PowerPoint with AI.
895
So you just text what you want, what you want in your slide, the data, and you can narrate it, and it was just going to create slides for you.
896
Schools use it, colleges use it, businesses use it.
897
Even founders or pitchers use it.
898
Yeah, I saw the 50 million.
899
That's the number I heard too.
900
Yeah.
901
Crazy numbers.
902
Very small team.
903
I believe 20 or so.
904
Yeah, I think I saw 16 or 20.
905
Yeah.
906
That was a number.
907
They are doing really, really well.
908
So they are doing well.
909
We have another company called Develop Health.
910
They are in the AI prior auth space.
911
So in prior authorization, you need that doctor's supporting evidence to get a certain drug or a treatment.
912
And building that case takes some time.
913
And with AI, you can build that case really fast and get your prior author.
914
So you get the treatment that you deserve.
915
They're doing about, I think, short of a shy of, I don't know what the recent number is, but at one place, I heard north of $5 million or so in revenue.
916
And haven't raised a.
917
Haven't raised a series A yet.
918
I think only five or six people in the company.
919
So that's a billion-dollar company if it's an AI company, right?
920
If it works out.
921
But there are examples.
922
I think our friend of the firm, Henry Xi, he's the co-founder of a company called Super.
923
He launched a leaderboard of companies that are doing millions in revenue, and he tracks how many people they have.
924
Yeah, revenue per employee.
925
That's right.
926
There's people on there with, seven figures, a million dollars per employee, two million per employee.
927
That's right.
928
So, so we're seeing that.
929
So, what does it mean from an investment perspective?
930
Is that, Gamma being a good example, is that normally for companies, when you're growing, you are burning.
931
And when you're burning to keep your growth going, you need to raise venture capital because venture capital funds growth.
932
And you need to keep investing.
933
And you need to overspend the cash inflows because it's such a valuable, high-margin project that if you don't invest to get there, you'll, you'll go, you'll go by investing and burning more money, you grow faster and it's worth more.
934
Classic example being Uber, they came up with a new way in which people move around cities, but it's not, but you got to spend a lot of money to keep it going.
935
But if you keep investing and you keep growing, it's going to break out.
936
So, people are going to stop using taxis and so on.
937
It's going to shift over.
938
And that's happened, right?
939
So, and that has happened on Amazon, that has happened on Apple.
940
So, you keep lose money to grow, but eventually, the bet is you're going to make a lot of money eventually because the market is going to shift in your favor.
941
So, that's the reason venture capital works really well to fund growth in loss-making companies.
942
It's crazy to everybody else.
943
But what is happening with AI is that these companies are growing fast, faster than non-AI companies, and they are profitable.
944
So, they don't really need venture money for growth.
945
So, if they don't need venture money for growth, what does it mean for VC?
946
Is the question.
947
So, if they can, if they can get to it with one or five or $10 million, they can get to amazing growth and are profitable with very few people.
948
What is the role of a large series A, a large series B, a large series C?
949
And especially if you lose the deal at this early stage, at the pre-seed stage or the seed stage, will you ever see it again?
950
Yeah, that's the question.
951
It definitely highlights the importance of just invest in that very first round they're starting a company because you might not get another chance.
952
That's right.
953
And that's why this very first,, I've always enjoyed this stage that we're investing in, the formation stage, just naturally, is as close to my bones.
954
But it's so strategic, also.
955
And especially with AI, when you may not need subsequent amounts of capital, if we don't invest in this stage, we're out of business pretty much.
956
Yeah.
957
So, if, and I think that's true from for, I don't know what will happen down the line, but there could be other reasons why companies Gamma will still raise venture money, but they're, but it's going to get it's going to get tougher for investors because they have to convince a founder who's growing really fast, who doesn't need venture capital to take venture money.
958
So, there almost needs to be an even bigger value add of,, we will help you build the business, we'll help you recruit, we'll help you sell and treat you to customers.
959
That's already the pitch from VCs.
960
But the pitch with VCs is that you get my money and you get my advice and you get my network in exchange for equity.
961, that's the bundled product, right?
962
Is it possible to unbundle that product and say, I will get equity just for the advice, or I will get equity just for my network?
963
And maybe you take some capital along with it.
964
So founders are picking, if they don't need the capital, they might need the other two.
965
So the investors who excel in those other two are going to continue to do well.
966
So is AI going to completely commoditize every product and the go-to-market is the only thing that matters at the end of the day?
967
It could.
968
I don't think so.
969
It could commoditize go-to-market, for example.
970 in today's world, you can get an AI SDR, you can get an AI BDR, you can probably do AI go-to-market also.
971
But isn't all that stuff just slop?
972 you open your inbox and it's, it's, hi, Animitra,,, I went to, I saw you went to,, New York University.
973
My third cousin also went there.
974, I'd love to sell you my BGB SaaS product.
975
Correct, correct.
976
It's a lot, it could be a lot of spam, right?
977
You're out, but maybe the smart way to do it is not just be spam, but it's on other places you spend your time.
978
Maybe Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, TV, who knows?
979
There are applications of AI in all things.
980
So, yes, AI can commoditize your product.
981, we're seeing if you're in the research space, let's say, public data research space, that's the idea.
982
You might get commoditized with enterprise products from ChatGPT or Perplexity, the research products there.
983
But if you're doing something that is not public data and it's private data, it might be in people's heads.
984
Maybe that's different.
985
Radiology, labs.
986
That's right.
987
So there are, there's always smart founders figure out a way.
988
Yeah.
989
So then, in terms of starting a four, I know you touched on it a little bit, but how I'm interested in how it all came about.
990
And I know you, you weren't born in the US.
991
So I don't know how you to tell the whole arc and the journey, but usually find it a little boring, but I'll tell you.
992
Okay.
993
I think we're what an hour in.
994
If people are still listening, I don't think you can churn them out at this point.
995
Yeah.
996
Yeah.
997
I didn't think I'd be an investor.
998
I thought I'd be a soccer player.
999
That was my journey.
1000
Really?
1001
Did you play a lot?
1002
I played a lot growing up, but then, but then I looked at, I grew up in various parts.
1003
I grew up in Hong Kong and then I went back to India, which is where I'm from.
1004
And then I looked up the FIFA world rankings for India and it was not very good.
1005
And then I realized that probably not going to make it.
1006
Even if I do make it, it may not work out.
1007
India, I think, has only qualified for the World Cup once.
1008
Didn't they make it recently?
1009
It was a really big deal.
1010
I don't think so.
1011
I think they made it in 1950.
1012
They still didn't go because they wanted to play barefoot.
1013
And the FIFA wouldn't allow them.
1014
So it's a very popular sport.
1015
A lot of money goes into amazing clubs.
1016
People love it, but it's just not invested enough.
1017
So anyway, so long story short, that didn't quite work out.
1018
And what do you do in India?
1019
What are your options?
1020
Your options are engineering or medicine, pretty much.
1021
And so I chose engineering.
1022
And then I came, and then I worked out of engineering school.
1023
I worked for about four years in tech.
1024
And you did a startup related to healthcare, right?
1025
Yeah.
1026
There were seven co-founders.
1027
It was, it was booking an online employment with doctors.
1028
Do it online, basically.
1029
It was called Planet Health Online.
1030
I'm still friends with all seven of them, by the way.
1031
It was, it was not the ideal founder makeup, basically.
1032
We didn't know what equity meant, for example.
1033
Okay, because if we knew that you split it seven ways, we probably wouldn't have done it that way.
1034
Did one person just have all the shares?
1035
No, no, I don't think we knew what equity meant.
1036
So we just wanted to start something because we were all co-living together, anyway.
1037
Okay, interesting.
1038
It was fun to just start something.
1039
And then I came to the States to go to business school because I really wanted to switch gears from engineering to product and then ended up.
1040
And then a couple of things happened,, in life where you get a break.
1041
First was Cornell gave me a break out of the blue.
1042
They accepted me.
1043
I didn't think I'd get accepted.
1044
So I got to come to Ithaca, which is, which is, I think, it's gorgeous.
1045
From were you in India at the time?
1046
I went from steamy Bombay in September to freezing Ithaca in November.
1047
Where is Ithaca in New York?
1048
Upstate New York, four hours from Manhattan.
1049
Okay.
1050
I didn't know where it was, but would you have gone?
1051
Would I have gone if I had known?
1052 if they were telling you,, this is upstate New York and you're going to be moving.
1053, I had never experienced snow in my life.
1054
So I probably would have gone regardless because it's just, I traveling and it was a different place.
1055
And it's a beautiful part of the country.
1056
I've gone back, taken my kids there.
1057
It's just amazing.
1058
Nice.
1059
Highly recommend the campus.
1060
It's probably the most beautiful campus of all U.S.
1061
universities.
1062
Really?
1063
Wow, that is a hot take.
1064
There are multiple lakes.
1065
It's really pretty.
1066
Interesting.
1067
Okay.
1068
I've never been.
1069
And then I wanted to get a job in tech.
1070
Couldn't get a job for various reasons.
1071
I looked at Google, Netflix, and a whole host of others.
1072
Finally, found my way into this company called Overture.
1073
So what was this, 2003?
1074
2004.
1075
2004.
1076
Last day of graduation, I got an invite to come out for an on-site interview at a company called Overture.
1077
Overture, for many people who don't know, invented paid search advertising.
1078
The little blue links you see on Google was invented by this company in LA called Overture.
1079
They invented the auction model, PPC, the way the web monetized at the time.
1080
And there was an alum at Overture.
1081
Because I would cold email everyone for a job, usually alumni.
1082
And this person forwarded my resume to someone else, a hiring manager, and they brought me on site.
1083
And if that person hadn't taken that risk, I probably wouldn't have a job.
1084
I probably would have to go back, go back to India.
1085
So I went out to LA.
1086
I did will in the interview.
1087
I got offered.
1088
I love the business.
1089
I just love the product, love the business.
1090
We were head to head against Google and we were trying, we were getting acquired by Yahoo.
1091
And then through that process, I learned about tech even more.
1092
I realized that,, what I really respected at the time is that Yahoo was being run by business people, media people, who believed in the world of portals, who believed in the world of large screen media.
1093
And Overture was run generally by technical people who could see that the portal is dead and search is the new thing because this is the way people are going to discover information.
1094
It's not the old school newspaper where an editorial team tells them what to read, which is the portal way of looking at things.
1095
But people will know what they want.
1096
They're going to type it in.
1097
They're going to search, and the search box is going to have results.
1098
And because there are just too many websites for a company Yahoo to manually editorialize.
1099
And the web is going to be huge.
1100
Well, so how did that play out then?
1101
Because if they were acquired Overture, right?
1102
That's right.
1103
So, Yahoo acquired Overture because Yahoo realized that search is going to be important, and Google was beginning to take off.
1104
And Overture had this money-making machine that they could make a lot of money, but they didn't really want over Yahoo was conflicted about their business.
1105
They wanted to preserve their media empire, the Hollywood style of working things.
1106
And whenever a business is conflicted about which way to go, it's usually the business people who win because the business people can point to immediate revenue.
1107
And the technical people, engineering people who can't point to immediate revenue, they usually lose.
1108
And that's what happened in this case.
1109
Google won, Yahoo lost.
1110
And then, and then the question for me was: what is the next turn?
1111
And the next turn was people are consuming information over social, Facebook.
1112
And then there was a little company out of South Park called Twitter.
1113
And then I was fortunate enough that second big break is to get an opportunity to interview at Twitter.
1114
Yeah, how did that all come about?
1115
I think Yahoo was trying to acquire Twitter.
1116
And my friend in the Corp Dev team went up to meet with the Twitter team.
1117
And I told them to slip in my resume on their way out.
1118
Okay.
1119
I don't know if that's exactly what it worked, or if my hold inbound is what resulted because I'm surprised I got the call because there were only 16 people at the company at the time.
1120
So you guys, so you were on the team looking to acquire them, and you were, I wasn't on the team.
1121
There was a Corp Dev team that I knew of who were looking to acquire them or talk to them at least.
1122
Okay.
1123
Because Yahoo had an outpost in near South Park called Brick House, which is where they put all their web 2.0 acquisitions Flickr, Jump Cut, and a bunch of cool things.
1124
They would put it in there because Yahoo didn't know what to do with them.
1125
And none of those funders would come to Sunnyvale to work.
1126
And Yahoo was Web 1.0.
1127
Web 1.0.
1128
The original Web 1.0, Jerry Yang and so on.
1129
Because there's, it's, what is what is it?
1130 read and then read and write was web 2.
1131
And I guess, I guess, just faster, more responsive websites.
1132
Okay.
1133
Interactive, faster websites.
1134
Yeah, one part of the website could change while you're editing the other part.
1135
It's just faster, cooler, fresher.
1136
Dig was the original Web 2.0, it's going to start it.
1137
Where you consume news.
1138
Twitter was another one, which was still based on a which was still a website.
1139
So I was lucky enough to get the role there.
1140
They were looking for the first product manager because Twitter at the time didn't know how to make money.
1141
Twitter was becoming the darling of the web.
1142
And everyone's questioned back in 2008, 2009 was this thing is really cool, wonderful that I know what you have for breakfast, but how is this going to make any money?
1143
Yeah.
1144
And at the time, I remember I joined when we were 25 and we would get inbounded from random strangers about business ideas about how to make money.
1145
Really?
1146
Yeah.
1147, how so?
1148, for example, we would, I will have investors share plans.
1149
On my very first day of work, I got an email forwarded by Ev, who was the CEO, who's the one who took a chance on me.
1150
And the email came from, I think, Steve Bomber or someone from Microsoft.
1151
They wanted to run ads on our search.
1152
Okay.
1153
And that was the way that we were going to make some money.
1154
We had folks from customers JetBlue who would say, we will,, I think there was an advertising idea.
1155
I know, I think, I think this was Disney.
1156
I think Disney's advertising idea to us back then is that we will pay Twitter money if you turn the two T's into Disney characters for a day.
1157
Twiddlede and Twiddledum for a movie that was about to come out.
1158
We'll pay you $200,000 or something.
1159
So when you look at the Twitter logo, the two T's in Twitter were the characters of this movie.
1160
That's right.
1161
So there were random ideas.
1162
To our benefit and to Ev's credit, he didn't want to do anything that is bespoke or custom.
1163 he wanted to be authentic.
1164
He wanted to be correct.
1165
So there's a lot of questions and conversations internally about advertising.
1166
Yeah.
1167
It makes sense logically.
1168
That's right.
1169
So that's what I started advertising products from scratch.
1170
And then my other big contribution was the verified check mark.
1171
Oh, you told me this before.
1172
Yeah.
1173
Yeah.
1174
So Oprah Winfrey wanted to join Twitter.
1175
Yep.
1176
But there were many other Oprah Winfrey accounts on Twitter.
1177
Okay.
1178
And Oprah Winfrey was worried that people wouldn't recognize it's her who's tweeting.
1179
And the way Twitter worked is when celebrities joined Twitter, they brought all of their fans to Twitter.
1180
And that's how Twitter grew.
1181
So you were really trying to get celebrities on Twitter?
1182
All the time.
1183
All the time.
1184
That really helped Twitter grow to where it is.
1185
So we had to come up with some way to signal to users that this is a legit Oprah Winfrey account.
1186
So we, our wonderful designer, Doug, at the time, came up with this pretty creative.
1187
This is the very check mark with a badge, a seal.
1188
And that was the thing.
1189
And it remains very, very popular to this day.
1190
Yeah.
1191
And now you have to pay for it on Twitter.
1192
Correct.
1193
Correct.
1194
Yeah.
1195
So then what were some of those first products made money?
1196
I know,, before the Elon takeover, it was doing a couple billion in revenue.
1197, what were some of the first things you rolled out that really started working?
1198
I think it was the advertising product is the one that makes money.
1199
Yep.
1200
They made money at the time.
1201
People are always tweeting and they want to get as wide an audience of those tweets as possible.
1202
And the concept behind advertising and Twitter is it's it's natively advertising.
1203
If you think about it, everyone is marketing something on Twitter.
1204
Yeah, especially today, if you open tech Twitter in our world, most of the tweets, the posts, an ad.
1205
Yeah, it's a promotional.
1206
It's they don't, it's technically not called an ad because they're not paying for it.
1207
But that's what they want.
1208
They want as wide an audience.
1209
And some of the businesses, especially, are willing to pay for it.
1210
And the core idea behind Twitter ads is that charge people money to boost it up in the way and the order in which it's shown and to who it's shown.
1211
Targeting doesn't work as well, but that's the idea.
1212
I think what could have been done better is that I think it was all text-based.
1213
So if it were images and videos, or if Twitter itself were images and videos, it would have been so much better, so much more valuable than what it is right now.
1214
So you're saying with Facebook, it's you think of stories, just immersive full screen video showing off a product and someone's more compelled to convert on and make a purchase.
1215
I'm saying more than just ads.
1216
The underlying core product itself for Twitter remained text for too long.
1217
The 140 character, the 280 characters, it was just text for too long.
1218
Whereas what people really wanted to do is to share videos and images, which tells a broader story.
1219,, a picture is more than just 140, 200 characters.
1220
So you're saying,, just by not expanding outside of text soon enough, Twitter kneecapped its growth.
1221
Correct.
1222
And there were opportunities to do it.
1223
And Twitter made acquisitions, but it wasn't, but for whatever reason, it didn't make it into the product.
1224
And so, but it did in Snapchat, it did in TikTok, it did in Instagram, it did in Facebook, and it does so now in Twitter.
1225
So it's changed a lot, especially the algorithmic feed, I think, is much better than what it used to be.
1226
But it's just the pace of innovation has been far too slow.
1227
It's interesting, when you think of some of these companies, Yahoo could have been Google, right?
1228 they really should have.
1229
Twitter could have been,, I don't know order of operations.
1230
I think Facebook started first, but there's a lot of these cases where,, an existing product, they might be doing billions in revenue.
1231
And then a new one just comes in 10 times bigger.
1232
And you think it's usually a function of business people are controlling it instead of product technical people?
1233
Well, maybe another way to think about it is founders taking a lot of willing, founders' ability to take risk.
1234
Founders always have a special ability to take risk.
1235
And generally, if they're correct every now and then, that's enough.
1236
Non-founders, it's just harder for them to take that foundational franchise risk.
1237
And other companies have done well with taking risk that Twitter hadn't.
1238 maybe Microsoft is a good example of, they didn't go anywhere for a decade, two decades, however long it was.
1239
And then, if you really think about over the past decade, they almost had founder mentality, CEO.
1240
They're the biggest counterexamples to the founder, founder journey, because Satya Dair, I think, it's clear that he took risk.
1241
He did take a lot of risk.
1242
He just didn't happen to be a founder.
1243
But maybe the key here is being having someone in the leadership who has the ability and the support to take a lot of risk.
1244
Make some mistakes, but ultimately they do have to be right.
1245
If they're not right, they're out.
1246
Yeah, that's true.
1247
And that's why it's risky.
1248
That's right.
1249
That's why, why would I, why would I,, risk my entire career when I could just continue making 10 million bucks?
1250
It's contrary to it to take risk.
1251
Yeah.
1252
And, but you've got to, you've got to really, really believe in it.
1253
So thinking about taking risk, you left Twitter.
1254
I think you mentioned a little bit you were working at this other fund called Foundation.
1255
Correct.
1256
You started it for.
1257
What was that arc to where you guys started doing it?
1258
At Twitter, I felt I had a lot of amazing experience.
1259
The first year or so was probably the best work experience I've ever had, where the weekends felt an interruption because we were inventing new things.
1260
We were moving so fast.
1261
That's the reason people don't work at startups.
1262
If you don't get that experience, it's probably not doing it.
1263
We're doing it.
1264
And then as Twitter got bigger, more layers, things became a little different.
1265
At the same time, there were companies Uber and Airbnb and Dropbox being invented within a one-mile radius.
1266
And it felt I was missing out.
1267
And Abs was great and inventing that product was amazing, but there was so much more that was happening.
1268
And so this entrepreneur in residence idea, I learned about it.
1269
And then venture funds had this where you could come in, they'll give you an office, you get to hang out at their partner meeting, you get to opine, you get to say whatever you want, and no accountability.
1270
You get to sit in on founder pitches.
1271
Again, you get to opine with no accountability.
1272
And you can work on your own idea and you get paid and you get amazing food.
1273
That's a great setup.
1274
The last one, especially.
1275
Yeah, it's the food and venture funds are amazing, I gotta say, especially the ones in Sandhill Road, not so much us.
1276
But so that's that, so it was a no-brainer for me to start working on my own idea.
1277
And then Foundation was kind enough to have me go through that process.
1278
And through that process, I think Foundation, my ideas were good, but they were not really great.
1279
The idea basically that I was working on, I worked on a bunch of different ideas.
1280
The one that I gravitated towards the end was it exists now, but it's on Spotify, but just for not anything outside of music.
1281
So talks, spoken word, learning content, all that stuff, podcasting, basically.
1282
That was the idea.
1283
This is back in 2012.
1284
So during that process, I also met my co-founder, Gaurav, who was a scout for a student scout for a student scout for foundation.
1285
And then he and I both ended up in venture in that same year, 2012.
1286
He went to Foundation, Founder Collective.
1287
I went to Foundation.
1288
And then it took us about three years.
1289
And then we realized that there's this opening in the market that we talked about that we can go even earlier and start something.
1290
And that was a big moment for us to decide because we hadn't raised any money ever.
1291
And then we had to go out and raise money for a venture fund.
1292
And we, we, and we weren't, I wouldn't say we weren't, it's not we were, he was coming out of Sequoia and I was coming out of Benchmarks.
1293
So it's not an automatic investment for LPs.
1294
Yeah.
1295
And we had, okay, fine, technical experience, et cetera, but we were not the, I don't know, the CTO at Facebook or something that.
1296
So it was, it was not an obvious choice.
1297
Plus, it was this pre-seed, maybe.
1298
Yeah, so what we were pitching was pre-seed.
1299
And when LPs would call up seed funds about pre-seed, they would say it's a fad.
1300
It'll go away.
1301
And it's not a thing.
1302
I think luminaries in our industry are on record to say pre-seed is BS.
1303
They don't say that anymore, but they did back then.
1304
So it's, and so how can smart LPs invest in that?
1305
So why did people think it was a fad?
1306
Because some, because it probably felt it.
1307
Because if you think about it, pre-seed feels subservient to seed.
1308
The word is a,, it's, it borrows from seed.
1309
It's less than seed.
1310
It's before seed.
1311
So seed is the thing, right?
1312
But what happens is that when a term, no matter what it was, how it started, eventually, when it's repeated enough by enough people, it becomes a thing of its own.
1313
I guess we saw that and others may not have wanted to see it.
1314
Fad meaning that it might not last.
1315
It may not be sustainable.
1316
It won't last.
1317
Founders will eventually realize it's not a thing.
1318
It is super interesting when you, if you were to meet a complete outsider and explain the lexicon, it's, so there's this thing that was called a series A.
1319
It was, hey, the first letter of the alphabet, that's, that's how they named your first funding round.
1320
Then there was a seed round that got created because it was,, seeding before the A.
1321
And then there was a pre-seed or it's pre-the round.
1322
And it's.
1323
And that has happened for a long time.
1324
Series A used to be $2 million dollar rounds back in the day when in the 70s and 80s, yeah, now that's a $2 million dollar round.
1325
And they would take 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 percent of the company.
1326
That's insane.
1327
For that.
1328
Yeah, and that's it's just, it's just, it's that, so we don't, we don't question the nomenclature.
1329
We don't come up with it.
1330
Yeah.
1331
We see an opportunity and then we go for it.
1332
So, then how did you raise you?
1333
You said you go for it, how did you raise the first fund?
1334
Because it was a 47 million dollar fund.
1335
If I'm thinking back a decade ago, adjusting for inflation, thinking about today, that's coming up with a pretty big fund.
1336
It's a larger case.
1337
Yeah, how'd you guys pull that off?
1338
I think a lot of credit goes to my co-founder, Garv.
1339
I think he's one of the most ambitious people I've met, and I think he was hell-bent on doing something important.
1340
And I think one of the things we realized is that if we believe in Creasey that much, then we have to signal to founders that we're their first-class citizens.
1341
Yeah, and why should they take money from a $5 million fund or a $10 million fund or a $20 million fund?
1342
It has to be substantial.
1343
So, we came up with 40.
1344
40 is substantial.
1345
And so, and so we've always thought about what is right for the right to break into founders, and then we work backwards.
1346
So, if 40 is the right number, the first step is to get to 20.
1347
Because if you raise half, then you can raise the other half, no problem.
1348
So, how did you do that?
1349
So, we first decided that we wanted to raise, let's get to first close, which is which is 20.
1350
And we talked to everybody up and down, and we came really, really close to a number of investors.
1351
But family offices worked really, really well for us.
1352
One of the reasons we succeeded in raising that initial 20 is because the support of GPs from foundation and support from GPs at Founder Collective.
1353
It really helped us that Founder Collective was a massively oversubscribed fund because they've been so, so successful.
1354
One of the one of the probably the best funds in venture history.
1355
I don't know if enough people know about it, but they had a lot of demand for their fund.
1356
Yeah, because they were seed/slash first-round investors in Uber yeah uber trade desk, oh, yeah q train The the trade desk,, cruise automation airtable the list is long amazing amazing ability you may and then some of them some of the smartest people in venture work there chris dixon used to used to used to work there from andreessen and a whole host of other people luminaries just walked through that walk through that door so they had a lot of demand and they were kind enough to share some of that demand with us and not all that demand converted but some did and that's the way we broke in we you gotta you gotta break up a problem into small parts solve that first part first and don't worry about the big problem because if you because this business our business is all about momentum if people if in the lps or investors believe you have momentum then then they want to be part of it yeah and then so we raised the 20 and then and then raised another another 20 and then when we raised that 20 a lot more followed so it ended up being 47.
1357
and then what's really interesting is from that fund almost all of our funds since then we went from 47 to 78 fund 78 million fund two 150 million dollar fund three and 185 million dollar fund four so it's gone up but 85 to 90 percent of the capital comes from existing investors in every single fund so everyone is re-upped and scaled up with us that's awesome and i because i just had michael kimet send on on the pod earlier today i think this this episode might come out a week or two after that but he had this concept of you got to flip people from fear to greed where they're afraid it's i don't want to lose money on this thing i don't look an idiot to it's the FOMO.
1358, I want to make money with these people.
1359, I know if i give them cash, they'll make me a bunch of money.
1360
Amazing investor, amazing LP.
1361
Unfortunately, they didn't invest in us but but a lot of respect for what they're building.
1362
Yeah.
1363
And so, I think one thing, and then you mentioned a lot of people said no.
1364, how did you embrace and work through that?
1365
If somebody's never raised a fund before, or somebody's in the middle of it right now, not a lot of people say yes.
1366
There's a lot of no's.
1367
How do you work through that and keep going?
1368
It's tough.
1369
It's a sales process.
1370
So, first, you have to have a product or whatever it is, and the product is you.
1371
The individual GP is the product.
1372
And you make up your story, you make up your thesis or whatever it is, and have some differentiation.
1373
When the investor or an LP is investing in the fund, they're just investing in you.
1374
And they are trying to figure out, are you going to be successful or not?
1375
Are you going to be some interesting deals or not?
1376
So, you're essentially selling your packaging and selling yourself.
1377
And it's usually hard to have a big ask.
1378
So, have a small ask in the beginning, maybe a smaller fund or something else.
1379
Whatever it takes to get in the game, the goal is to get in the game, get in the game, and then the job for the first fund is to just get into this, to start the second fund.
1380
And then the fund size doesn't really matter.
1381
We got super lucky.
1382
I don't know if we will be able to do it today, given all the competition.
1383
Back then, I think we got a little bit lucky and we got a lot of support.
1384
But whatever it takes to get in the game, just get in the game because I think anyone can be successful.
1385
Is there something that you see a lot of people get wrong in fundraising?
1386
Maybe it was mistakes you made, or even today, where people are.
1387
I think the classic one is everyone who starts off tries to play by the rules that have been set by the larger funds.
1388
So, they have to have a parado strategy, they have to have a follow-on strategy, they have to have a diligence process, they have to have conflict policy, all of that stuff.
1389
They have to have, I don't know, voting mechanisms.
1390
You don't have to have any of those.
1391, turns out none of those things matter.
1392
All that matters is: are you in any interesting companies or not?
1393
And do you have the ability to prove that you can get in them?
1394
And then, and then all the other stuff is not important.
1395
So, if you have to invest in similar companies that are doing something at your stage, you don't know how these companies are going to change over time.
1396
There's no reason to impose any restrictions on access.
1397
So, my only advice to anyone who's getting started is blow up the rules and do whatever it takes to get into the most interesting companies at the early stages.
1398
Yeah, that's good advice.
1399
I have one more question: Who was the best A4 intern of all time?
1400
That's a hard one.
1401
That's such a hard one.
1402
We've had an army of interns since you left Turner, so I don't want to disappoint you.
1403
But no, you're great.
1404
You're amazing.
1405
And one of the things we see is that many people, and we've had the opportunity to work with amazing folks at a four, and hopefully many of them, all of them will stay, but some of them will continue on to something else.
1406
But they go on to do amazing things what you've done with your fund and this podcast and everything.
1407
And the investments ultimately speaks volumes.
1408
We've had other folks who have gone through a four, they were interns, and then we ended up investing in them.
1409
And then hopefully, many of them will get to work with them as the part of a four over time.
1410
Yeah, so we devote ourselves to the people we work with, but in return, we expect a lot from them too.
1411
And then we want to keep this going for as long as possible.
1412
But you were the best, bro.
1413
Well, thank you.
1414
Thank you.
1415
We got that on record now.
1416
Of course.
1417
Put that in the.
1418
I've been thinking I need to make some sizzle reel or trailer, a one or two minute trailer of just highlights from you package in the episode, showing up on the YouTube channel or whatever, or when you send this somebody,, hey, yeah, some a highlight reel.
1419
Anyways, well, I'll try to figure out how to get that in there.
1420
There's a couple where you'll have a reaction from someone,, oh, that was such a good question, or, oh, you did so much research.
1421, I've been thinking about how do I package some of those things up.
1422
It's not it, it's, it's not high on the priority list.
1423
It would be if I had three employees, I would have someone work on it, but it's so many things.
1424
But, anyways, this is a lot of fun.
1425
Thanks for coming on.
1426, we're over.
