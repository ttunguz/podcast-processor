--- METADATA END ---

1
We're an AI-powered like customer communications platform and intelligence platform.
2
So we do things like full contact center with omnichannel.
3
You want to do you know online chat with your customers, social media chat with your customers, like WhatsApp integration, email.
4
We do the full call center as well, all integrated with one full customer journey and all that.
5
And then we do, on top of that, provide basically messaging, voice, video for everything you need, full communication platform worldwide.
6
And then we run AI on top of it.
7
So we, I mean, our focus is on customer communication and whatever is going to make that better or more efficient.
8
It's a combination of all of it.
9
I'm not a big believer that it's going to take over the world and you're not going to need, you know, a support agent anytime soon.
10
And even if it does, you'll be able to do some really...
11
So, Brian, tell me, introduce to listeners who you are and where you, what your background is as far as it's relevant to Dialpad and what Dialpad does.
12
Yeah, for sure.
13
So my background, real quick background, is I've been in like communications and tech for over 20 years.
14
I was back at Google.
15
I started Google when I came out of college in 2002.
16
There was about, I think, 600 people there.
17
Wow.
18
So I got to live a lot of the growth of Silicon Valley and got to live it all.
19
So I was there.
20
I was there for eight years, living through like going from 600 to, I don't know, it was like 15,000 by the time I left.
21
And then while I was there, I learned obviously a lot about cloud infrastructure and just Google infrastructure too.
22
And my co-founder from Dialpad, he got acquired through his company, which is called Grand Central at the time.
23
And they were a phone system that like rings all your different phones.
24
And this is back in, you know, 2005.
25
So this is really state-of-the-art stuff back then.
26
They got acquired, and then I got brought in and introduced to them because I already knew the technology.
27
And so, I came in, helped them migrate everything to Google architecture and infrastructure, and that became Google Voice.
28
Okay, so we were the team that built Google Voice, and then we were at Google, and we're like, Google Voice was mostly a consumer product.
29
And at the time, we're like, this makes a lot of sense for businesses, the same technology.
30
And we didn't think anything was that great out there, and so we left, and that's how Dialpad started.
31
Google funded us, and we even have Rich Miner on our board, the co-founder of Android.
32
Sure.
33
So, we are all in on this and been doing it now for 14 years.
34
Wow.
35
So, yeah, that's kind of our quick background on how we got started.
36
Yeah, Google Voice still exists.
37
It does as a consumer product.
38
It does, and it also is a business product.
39
So, Google did eventually sort of build it out for their workspaces product.
40
But it's pretty lightweight.
41
Like, we're probably in the more advanced version and full contact center and all that, too.
42
Yeah, it's interesting, things like Google Voice that they don't seem to promote at all.
43
I mean, I've heard about it through friends.
44
I tried it years ago, but they seem to have these products that are created, pushed out, and then they you gotta find them.
45
Yep, or they cancel them.
46
Maybe.
47
Yeah, yeah.
48
Yeah, no, they still are going strong on it.
49
We don't really cross over much with them.
50
I think it's still a really good product if you want to get like a second phone number.
51
Yeah.
52
So you don't have to give out your personal cell phone number.
53
But I, yeah, we don't really cross over much with them.
54
They seem to be mostly still consumer from what we can tell.
55
So what does Dial Pad do?
56
So we, the quick phrase is we're an AI-powered like customer communications platform and intelligence platform.
57
So we do things like full contact center with OmniChannel.
58
If you want to do, you know, online chat with your customers, social media chat with your customers, like WhatsApp integration, email.
59
And we do the full call center as well, all integrated with one full customer journey and all that.
60
And then we do, on top of that, provide basically messaging, voice, video for everything you need, full communication platform worldwide.
61
And then we run AI on top of it.
62
So we bought a company about eight years ago called TalkIQ, which was way before obviously this big boom in like this version of AI.
63
And they did voice AI.
64
And we knew, we already knew when we started building this that the future of communications is going to involve a lot of AI, right?
65
Like they need to go hand in hand.
66
And so we kind of knew that was happening.
67
And we saw this company and we said, hey, this is a perfect fit.
68
They could do live transcription and coaching on a live sales call.
69
And we're like, if we can connect that with our platform, this is going to be gold.
70
And that's what we've been doing for the last eight years is building out that team, connecting all the pipes.
71
And now, as far as I know, we're one of the few people who can do like real live coaching.
72
Things like, you know, if someone asks a question on a live phone call, we can provide the answer.
73
Not a chat, but like an actual live conversation like we're having right now.
74
It can respond.
75
And that's obviously super useful for support teams.
76
It's really useful for sales.
77
So if someone calls in and they're like, want to ask about your competitor, right?
78
You might be a new sales rep.
79
And you might not remember how to answer.
80
How do I go?
81
It would detect, it detects the question, and it automatically pops up for the agent on their screen, the sales rep, hey, here's how you should answer this, right?
82
And that's a feature we've had for seven years, and it's one of the biggest sellers we have.
83
But we do other things, like all kinds of stuff, with this data.
84
And we have all this vast amount of data.
85
We have over 8 billion minutes of like sales and support conversations running through our platform.
86
And so, we do a lot of other things with AI.
87
Like, customer satisfaction is another big feature of ours.
88
We have automatic AI, customer satisfaction.
89
And I don't know if you've ever called into something and at the end of the call, it says stay on the line for a survey, right?
90
And no one ever does it.
91
Or if you stay on the line, it's usually because you're pissed off.
92
And then so it's probably going to be a bad rating.
93
Well, we built a model that's all our own that analyzes the customer satisfaction of every single conversation to 90% accuracy.
94
And so now instead of like only having 5% of your conversations graded and customer satisfaction rated, we're doing 100%.
95
And so then that can tell you who are your best sales reps, who are your best agents, who are the agents who, when they talk to you, the customers are the least happy, right?
96
Like that's super important information.
97
Or what are they complaining about?
98
You have millions of minutes on your call center a month.
99
What are they talking about?
100
Like, are they complaining?
101
What features are they complaining about?
102
So that's our thing, is we're unlocking all that data, too.
103
And so our other slogan is like, voice is the last offline data set.
104
It was really, if you think about business, it's the only thing that isn't tracked.
105
Yeah.
106
Right?
107
Because it's so, it's hard to do.
108
You have to transcribe it.
109
You have to then analyze it with natural language processing.
110
And the way we've been able to scale is we built all of it ourselves.
111
So all the AI we do by our own transcription, we do our own transcription with high accuracy.
112
We have a vast amount of PhDs and AI people at our company.
113
And so, we've just been cranking away for the last seven years building out all these things.
114
And it's that perfect combination of AI with communications.
115
So, that's our thing.
116
The model, is that a fine-tuned open-source model?
117
Is that built on llama?
118
Yeah, so we took everything that's pretty much open source and we combine it.
119
We fine-tune it.
120
We have our own recipes of tweaking these models to get the best out of them.
121
And then we take our eight-plus billion minutes of conversations that are like 100% relevant, right?
122
Because they're all real sales calls, they're all real support calls, and we use that to fine-tune them.
123
And then that in turn gets us super high accuracy, better than ChatGPT, and better than like Google or Amazon's transcription, all because it's with perfect data.
124
And if you like, use ChatGPT, it's amazing and it can do a lot of things, but it's built around data of the whole world wide web, which is good, but it's also bad because there's fake news and you know, or like things that just aren't relevant to your business.
125
And when us, like, you need it to be so relevant because your conversations are very different than another business's conversations, right?
126
Yeah.
127
And the customer are enterprises or BPOs, or where are you selling into?
128
Yeah, we're selling to almost every type of company in every vertical, and I think that's one of the best parts about Dialpad, and we pitch this to like people who we recruit.
129
Is the coolest thing about our product is literally every business in the world needs our software.
130
But we're in about a third enterprise, a third mid-market, a third SMB, in all kinds of verticals, retail, recruiting, healthcare, everything.
131
Like Uber is a big customer of ours.
132
Motorola.
133
Randstat is one of the largest recruiting firms in the world.
134
Los Angeles Chargers are using us.
135
Netflix is using us.
136
So we have a large and vast range.
137
And we're in over 50 countries.
138
So we've got a pretty big international presence too.
139
Yeah.
140
And is it primarily customer service or customer discovery?
141
And do you have a voice or a chatbot interface that handles most stuff and then hands off to a live agent if need be, if it's in that space?
142
Or is it supporting sales calls where it's a human calling out and they just need support?
143
Yeah, we do.
144
So we have basically like three, three different things we're selling to.
145
We're selling to salespeople.
146
So we have a product called Dialpad Cell, which is for the sales team, both inbound and outbound.
147
So like if you want to put a phone number on your website for sales leads, right?
148
We handle all of that.
149
We also handle outbound if you're like a BDR calling out people or even messaging, right?
150
We support messaging too.
151
We have a very large contact center product as well for support teams.
152
So for your support contact center.
153
And then we also have Dialpad Connect, which is kind of the knowledge worker.
154
So say you're someone who just doesn't want to use your personal cell phone number or you have an assistant.
155
And we provide all that software for just basic advanced business phone system and messaging as well.
156
So, those are kind of the three things.
157
And then, on the chatbot, all of those support, especially the cell and the support side, they support full modern, like rag LLM-based chatbot that we've built.
158
We launched last fall or this past year that does all of that.
159
It sucks in your knowledge base.
160
So, you basically connect it to your knowledge base or upload any data you want.
161
We scour the whole thing.
162
And then, when someone comes in and says, Hey, how do I do this thing with my account?
163
It automatically dips into your knowledge base and it returns a beautiful, you know, human-language version of the answer, right?
164
And uses the LLM technology to parse the question and then also to construct the answer.
165
And then, does the whole vector database lookup and all this stuff behind the scenes to get the right answer?
166
And we built all this stuff around it to do curation.
167
Because, like, the biggest problem with enterprises have is like they don't want to just unleash an LLM directly to their customers.
168
Sure.
169
They want to make sure it says exactly what they want it to say.
170
And so, we had to build a whole curation system around it that does things like: here's all the questions we've seen, here's all the answers that we would provide, our technology would provide.
171
Do you want them?
172
Yes, no.
173
Oh, I want to change the wording on this one, right?
174
And so, we have all that.
175
And they can even take actions.
176
And if they don't have the answer through the, we call it AI agent, or that's our product name.
177
If they can't get it from the AI agent, they can easily from the same chat window escalate to a real person.
178
And it has their whole customer journey already summed up.
179
So it says, like, oh, here's what they were asking the bot about, right?
180
Here's what they got, what they didn't get from it.
181
So now when the agent, the real human, takes over, they got it right there.
182
It's already, and that's kind of our other strategy is we want to own the whole customer journey because you've all probably had bad experiences too where like you start on like an online chat that is clearly a bot and it doesn't help you and you escalate and then you kind of have to repeat yourself right to the person you're now talking to or provide the same information again a lot of times it's because a completely different system yeah and that's what we're also trying to solve the way you can get the whole picture of a customer is if you have all those endpoints like we even do video meetings so if you're a salesperson you can go from messaging someone to a call with someone to now let's schedule a meeting it's all in the same timeline you can see everything you talked about over a meeting over a call over a message we can summarize all that and that that's like our strategy right like that's we think it should have been the way things work right that's kind of like the real unified communications yeah uh the customer service end of it is is getting kind of crowded it seems to me just based on the yeah at this conference as i can tell yeah a number of pitches i have from companies uh you know there's uh do you know sierra uh-huh these guys uh there's a new company crescendo that was you know sort of has humans and and the ai all under one roof as opposed to like having a vpo and then your chat bot and trying to make them talk to each other uh how do you stay ahead of the the pack yeah there's so much competition i think when when chat GPT came out, I think every single smart person in the world said, Wow, this would be amazing for customer support.
183
And so now, since those large language models came out, I think it feels like half the startups are trying to build some kind of customer support by.
184
The way we stay ahead is one, we have our own AI team.
185
So we've been started, we started on this before people did start on this, and we already had the technology of an AI team and inference and all these things you need to run AI at scale.
186
So when this whole world of like large language models came out, we already had all the team to do it.
187
We had the scale to do it.
188
We had the data to do it.
189
So we've already been cranking as fast as we can.
190
So we, one, think we're ahead of those.
191
But even then, the thing that differentiates a lot of us or us versus maybe some of these startups is anyone can go build a chat bot.
192
You know, you can usually figure it out and there's enough stuff out there.
193
But it's really hard to build like a global real-time communication platform.
194
And I mean not just chatbot.
195
Like to have a full contact center, that what businesses expect is they need all of it in one.
196
They need the ability to like, yeah, go online and talk to a bot on a website, but then like we just talked about, escalate to a real person or transfer to a real person or add someone to a call or maybe switch to screen share.
197
We have this built-in where you can call into a call center and they get a link and you can see the screen share of the agent.
198
So the agent can show you what they mean when they're, you know, like that's the type of stuff that you kind of have it have an all-in-one.
199
And it's really hard to build.
200
Like that, that was our background with Google Voice.
201
You have to build a worldwide platform.
202
We're in over 50 countries pretty much day one because we are also telephony.
203
And that is expected.
204
You have to work with the phone number.
205
And if you're missing a huge piece of that puzzle.
206
And it's really hard to build that piece.
207
Yeah.
208
So we've been spending our lives building it.
209
And it's not something you can just like learn.
210
in your college class at Stanford and they don't teach it.
211
They teach mobile apps.
212
I can build an iPhone app, but they don't teach how to build like a worldwide, real-time, reliable communication network.
213
We have to work with carriers around the world and have partnerships.
214
We have to do all of this in-house.
215
And that is so hard to build that that gives us all those advantages of customer journey.
216
It gives us the data advantage.
217
These AI startups don't have the data.
218
They're buying conversational data online that's not really relevant.
219
So it's kind of that whole packed together package, right?
220
Yeah.
221
The voice or voice data, I mean, the captured conversations and that analysis, you said that voice is the last online data set.
222
Yeah.
223
It seems, do you do other things beyond customer calls?
224
I mean, you mentioned, you know, teleconference, like group meetings and things like that, even live meetings.
225
And there are a lot of tools now that transcribe those meetings and they're hooked up to a chat bot that then you can query the meeting.
226
But it seems for an enterprise, that would be a pretty powerful tool if you could capture all the conversations that go on in meetings with, you know, with the knowledge of the beach.
227
That's how we use, we use, obviously, we use our own product internally.
228
So, all of our meetings internal are with Dialpad meetings.
229
I would say, to be honest, so we have lots of companies who use Dialpad meetings instead of any of the other competitors for internal and external meetings.
230
Most of our customers are using our meetings product as a seller or a support agent with a customer.
231
Because the thing about our platform is like, again, I just told you a little story about like, hey, I first start texting you, I call you on an outbound call, then I set up a meeting with you.
232
Having all that data and conversation in one thing, so they use us for the meeting with the customer, even though they might use something else internally for their own internal meetings.
233
But that gives them all the other features we've built, like live coaching.
234
Like one of the features we have is called playbooks, where it tells you, here's all the things you need to figure out on this call.
235
You need to find out their budget.
236
You need this kind of typical sales playbook stuff, right?
237
But you can customize it with us.
238
But you can say, I want you to first initial call, find out their budget, find out their use cases, right?
239
And it knows when you asked the question.
240
It tells you to ask it.
241
It knows when you asked it, and then it does a little summary of their answer.
242
And so that now is all combined with even your call you had with them a week earlier.
243
It all goes to your CRM.
244
It goes into our system too, but it can go to your CRM.
245
And now you have the full picture.
246
And then we can do even cool things like, you know, some of the stuff we do is like a churn prediction.
247
You know, for the support side, same thing.
248
Like they might, one, we can analyze that, but getting back to your original thing, support people.
249
They can hit a button that gives you a unique link to join our meeting product, where now you can be face-to-face, which increases satisfaction.
250
They can share their screen, you can share your screen.
251
We even have like remote desktop control so they could take over your screen if they want to like do the thing for you.
252
And again, it keeps that conversation together.
253
So you just switch the video from a regular phone call, but it's keeping all that data in one place.
254
So like that's where, that's kind of like where we have so heavily invested in video is because future, it's customer relations is going to be a lot of that too.
255
You kind of just need it all, right?
256
So we don't want to miss anything.
257
Yeah.
258
Yeah.
259
Is there a consumer side to this?
260
We have a lot of consumers who buy Dialpad.
261
That's not what we're going after.
262
There's a lot of one-person, two-person businesses using us.
263
My parents are using it for their home phone system.
264
I'm using it with my wife.
265
But we don't stop anyone from signing up, but it's pretty much mostly, yeah, for B2B.
266
And is it, you don't stop people from signing up?
267
Is it prohibitive for an individual?
268
No.
269
So one of the first things we did, and this was our Google Voice background, I think we were the first product where you could sign up for a phone number online and get it instantly was Google Voice back in like 2000 seven or eight.
270
And so we took that and we said most of our competition was contact sales.
271
Right.
272
So one of the first things we did was like, nope, you're going to be able to do everything and sign up online.
273
You're going to be able to go and pick a number, search numbers, do everything, pay and get phone calls or get messaging instantly.
274
So we always prioritize that.
275
So that's why we do have a lot of just people who come to our website.
276
And then, how do you charge?
277
Is it pay as you go?
278
It's per seat.
279
So, most of the stuff is per seat.
280
If you're just using our regular Dial Pad Connect, it's, you know, that one's the cheaper one, and that's more for just regular.
281
I need a separate number and more controls for my business line.
282
And then it goes into like the contact center is more expensive because it has all these other things, and call routing, and skills-based routing, and all the extra AI that goes on it.
283
But even our base one has AI and transcription and summaries.
284
So, yeah, it's and then our contact center has a very small per-minute charge, depending on international calls, toll-free calls, things like that.
285
Yeah.
286
Why is it taking from a consumer's point of view, such a long time for this to penetrate the market?
287
Because I still get that chat bot that doesn't do anything.
288
And, you know, I got to wait, and then it's somebody at a call center in India, and they don't really ask me the same questions I've already answered.
289
Why is it taking such a long time for enterprises to adopt these technologies?
290
Yeah, well, they haven't found out about Dialpad yet, so that's that's part of it.
291
You know, we announced we're over 300 million in revenue just last year, so we're getting there, but we have a long way to go.
292
It's a massive market.
293
The main reason is: one, to do what I'm telling you, you have to have the whole thing.
294
You can't just be an AI agent bot.
295
You have to have the whole thing to have that amazing customer experience.
296
And not really, anyone's built it yet because they either were a traditional legacy call center where they don't have AI or they're catching up last minute to AI, right?
297
It's not their specialty, or you're an AI startup who's building an amazing bot, but then you're asking to integrate.
298
You're like trying to reach, but integration is even hard and it's expensive because they have to make their margins.
299
And a lot of times they're using a third party for their AI, so it becomes really expensive.
300
And it's also just so new.
301
Like if you think about like how with these, with ChatGPT, that was not that long ago.
302
That really was, those large language models were a real breakthrough.
303
And it wasn't really possible until then, but now people were playing with them.
304
But to do all this stuff to make it enterprise ready, there's a lot of work.
305
Like you can't just release it to the world.
306
And I think there was a company that said they replaced like 90% of their support agents with their own homegrown chat GPT bot.
307
And they just pulled that back and said it wasn't working.
308
It's because you can't just unleash this amazing technology and give it directly to the consumer.
309
It'll say crazy things.
310
And you need all this extra stuff around it and you need compliance.
311
It's just, it's not easy to then get it out the door.
312
And it's still only been a couple years since people have been able to really, really have it available.
313
Because even before then, it was not available.
314
Like GPUs weren't available.
315
If we wanted to use Google or Open AI, they didn't have enough bandwidth.
316
So even if we wanted to roll out this amazing chat bot, so did everyone else in the world.
317
You couldn't scale it.
318
And so we then immediately said we can't wait on them.
319
So that's why we started even having our own AIs running on our own machines and in some cases even down to the CPU because we needed availability.
320
I was saying, I think we have the world record for generative AI summaries of calls and meetings.
321
And it's only because we're able to scale it.
322
And because we built it ourselves, it's cheap.
323
Whereas if you were using someone else, it'd be so much money.
324
And so it's just kind of the luck of it's so new, that's why.
325
Yeah.
326
But it's coming.
327
Yeah, everyone's talking now.
328
I mean, enterprise first has to adopt this, but everyone's talking about these multi-agent systems.
329
Are you guys exploring that?
330
Are you integrating that into your stack?
331
And what would the agents do if you are working on that?
332
Yeah.
333
What do you mean by exactly?
334
Like, what do you mean by multi-agent?
335
Well, the agents that can take action.
336
So I'm guessing.
337
Oh, yeah, yeah.
338
Yeah.
339
You know.
340
It's like the agentic AI, yeah.
341
Like the things that actually can do things instead of just answering call center agents.
342
Yeah, yeah.
343
But that also doesn't help us that, like, now, everything's called an agent, even if it's not a call center agent.
344
Yeah.
345
So that's stuff that's already, we already do some of that, and we're doing even more advanced stuff with that.
346
But that's part of what our bot can do, our AI agent, is you can say, hey, I want to schedule a meeting.
347
And it'd be like, oh, let me go reach into your scheduling system and say, what times are available?
348
And then it'll bring back, okay, we have these times, and they can click it, and then it writes it back to that same system.
349
So we already have, that's what a lot of these workflows.
350
So before agents, it was kind of called workflows, which is like that if this, then that flow.
351
And you need a lot of that.
352
You want to say, only if they ask this, can they then do this?
353
So, a lot of permissioning around it as well.
354
Yeah, we already have that, but we're starting to do even more.
355
So, like, things like we have the concept of holiday hours, like setting your business hours.
356
And that would have been really hard for you to go in and find it in the interface of a thousand different things and set it.
357
Well, from our own assistant inside of our web settings, you can say, Hey, I want to change my holiday hours.
358
It says, Okay, what would you like to change it to?
359
Okay, I'm open on weekdays this time, and weekends we're closed.
360
And it's like, okay, we're going to respond with, is this correct?
361
You want these changes?
362
Yes, and it changes it.
363
So, that is, I think that is the biggest trend you're going to see this year: is all this stuff that it's taking now, this amazing understanding of the language and taking action with it.
364
That's why you're hearing about it all over the place.
365
Yeah.
366
The agentic explosion is happening.
367
Yeah.
368
Yeah.
369
Yeah.
370
We're right there.
371
And for you guys, I mean, it's that you have a strong business, but there's kind of an endless market.
372
I mean, a lot of people chasing it, but you're in the game.
373
So, what's the future?
374
Are you just working on building market share or developing new products or new directions?
375
And if so, what are those directions?
376
I'm asked.
377
Yeah.
378
I guess agents or an AI agents is one of them.
379
I mean, our focus is on customer communication and whatever is going to make that better or more efficient.
380
And it's a combination of all of it.
381
I'm not a big believer that it's going to take over.
382
And even if it does, it'll be able to do some really common tasks for you.
383
But you'll always need an escalation path.
384
You'll always need to be able to then get to have a complicated discussion with a real person.
385
So, one, yes, all that automation.
386
We just launched last year our next generation AI agent, which is using all the latest technology in our own large language model.
387
Then the next phase is voice.
388
So taking the same platform, which is all the same stuff, right?
389
If they ask this or want this, do the same thing, except in text form.
390
You're going to do it in voice form, right?
391
And then if they have a problem, you can switch to a real person and they can talk to you.
392
Then there's all this stuff we can do with the data, though.
393
So like we do a lot of live coaching, and I told you like the playbooks and like we even do like automatically score a customer conversation that from the agent's perspective.
394
Like how good is the agent at doing this?
395
Did they welcome them?
396
Did they, you know?
397
And so we have like QA scorecards, we call it with AI, where it automatically grades the calls.
398
So again, you can train your agents.
399
So there's a lot of just enhancing humans is like, I still believe is a lot of what we're doing.
400
I don't, just like even, and I'm a programmer, like, I don't think it's going to replace me, but it's making me faster, like so much faster.
401
And it just means we're going to do more.
402
And then, yeah, the next part is we still want to automate.
403
And I think there is a lot of automation.
404
And, but the data part, sorry, the data part is with all this amazing conversation, you should be able to, there's so much gold in there.
405
Like, which customers are happy, which ones are unhappy.
406
We'll be able to tell you, which we're working on right now, we'll be able to tell you which customers are likely to churn based on the conversations they've had.
407
We've found already that you can tie those conversations to when you connect it to like you know their status or if they churn, we can learn off of that and we'd say, hey, this is what we should be doing.
408
And now here's what you should be saying to avoid, or cross-sell, or how do you counter if they're upset so that they become a loyal customer.
409
And so it turns out we're not trying to save like you're making so much money off of how much happier customers are or your sales is doing so much better because of all this information you're now able to provide, because you don't have to repeat yourself, because you do know what your sales team talked to them about two months ago.
410
So, and analyzing all that data, that's that's like the future.
411
Is like, there's this, all this data now.
412
We got to take it, we got to give you insights.
413
Yeah.
414
Yeah.
415
Is there going to be a point at which AI voice and large language models and agents are seamless or strong enough that they'll do a lot of the customer interaction?
416
Yeah.
417
I think there's going to be a lot of simple stuff.
418
And there's some people even talked about it here.
419
If you get an answer fast for your problem or your problem's fixed, you don't care if it's an AI or not.
420
It's whatever gets it done.
421
You don't want to be on hold for 20 minutes and then another 20-minute conversation just to do some simple thing.
422
If a AI agent can do it for you, that's going to make the customer happy.
423
And if you look at a lot of the interactions, especially in customer support, 80% probably are like, you know, are simple things that a bot could do.
424
And then it's a win-win for everyone.
425
Your best people are solving real hard problems instead of doing like tedious same thing over and over again.
426
And the customer's happy because they're getting.
427
Are you?
428
I imagine that you track research and what's happening in the round world of AI.
429
Yeah, I'm obsessed with it.
430
Yeah.
431
Yeah.
432
What do you do you have any?
433
Where do you think the most exciting areas are?
434
I mean, I'm sort of obsessed right now with MANOS, this channel, which I don't have access to yet, but I've watched plenty of videos of people that do have access, and it's amazing.
435
I mean, it's not something that I think companies like OpenAI or Anthropic couldn't do themselves.
436
Yeah, but I don't know.
437
And is that the most interesting part of what's going on or reinforcement learning-rich something?
438
I think that made the headlines.
439
It seems like it's a lot of people don't really know enough about it because they don't have access.
440
We haven't done tests on it.
441
So that one's more, in theory, it sounds amazing, but when you look at it, at least just from demos, it looks like it's just a lot of heavy compute and using the same technology, but like reinforcement stuff, like continuing to reprompt and reprompt and reprompt and doing it faster.
442
So it's hard to know if it's like a breakthrough technology or if they just wrote some amazing things around the traditional models.
443
And we don't know yet, like until we get more information.
444
I think we're still at the beginning of this breakthrough.
445
And that's why the future is taking all this stuff and now automating as much as we can.
446
But I don't think it's going to be auto-magical.
447
I don't think it's like, just take this thing and.
448
I think there's going to be a lot of vertical where you have to go in and build specific bots for legal, specific things for automating your whatever workflow you have in your company, but it's going to be very specific to you.
449
I don't think you're just going to be able to take this new amazing thing and say, go do this.
450
I don't think it's going to work.
451
It's going to need, and even then there's privacy stuff, and like they have to have access.
452
That's the problem.
453
Like, for all these agents, you can tell it all you want, but it can't log in for you.
454
Like, I want it to solve, like, hey, I want to book a vacation, go find the best place, do reviews, look at the reviews, book me the cheapest flight.
455
But like, it doesn't have access to do that.
456
Like, the whole internet blocks bots.
457
And so, like, the next phase you've probably heard about too is that MCP protocol, where it's basically a way to connect all these things that can do actions to the LLMs.
458
And so, you're going to see a lot of like that's enabling the agents as everyone builds this interface layer so that the LLMs can talk to their product to do things.
459
That's like the new way of APIs.
460
Oh, that's interesting.
461
Yeah, and that's like the next big thing.
462
Like, Anthropic built this, and it's, it's, yeah, kind of the next big thing.
463
So, so a website, like an airline website, would you have to log into your account, but if you're an agent that's been vetted or something, it gets access.
464
Yeah, so you would, yeah, so you would, you would go in theory, and this is all relatively new.
465
Yeah, you would go to that, you would go to the so claude, Anthropic's claude has support for this, and OpenAI, I think, will have it, if not, but it's similar.
466
You'd basically go and say, I want to add this airline to my.
467
So you'd then quickly authenticate that, oh, it's me.
468
And so now when you say book a flight, it has access as you to now go do things with that airline.
469
That's the next wave.
470
But the problem is those businesses still have to enable that.
471
They can't just crawl the web.
472
There are some stuff to crawl the web, but it's still not perfect.
473
That's like really, it's all over.
474
Is this MCP model context protocol?
475
I believe what it's called.
476
But you'll hear a lot about this, I think, in the next, yeah.
477
Yeah, okay.
478
MPC.
479
MCP.
480
MCP.
481
Yeah.
482
Little dyslexic.
483
Yeah, if you just Google it, you'll see a million things now about it.
484
But it is, this year is about agents doing things for you.
485
Right.
486
And a lot of the enabling of that is with that technology.
487
Yeah.
488
But that's what we're doing too.
489
Like, because you, again, makes sense for customer support, for sales, you want to solve the simple things.
490
Like, I just need to change my billing address.
491
Right.
492
Like little things that it should be able to handle.
493
But yeah, privacy security, authentication is a big part of the roadblocks to that.
494
Yeah.
495
Okay.
496
This has been fascinating for me.
497
I hope it's fascinating.
498
I love talking about all that stuff.
499
For users or for listeners.
500
Yeah.
501
And I'll log on to DialDad.
502
Maybe I'll become a user individually.
503
Awesome.
504
Yeah.
505
Yeah.
506
Awesome.
507
Thanks for having me.
508
Yeah, great.
509
Thanks.
