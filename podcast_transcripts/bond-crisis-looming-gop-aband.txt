1
All right, everybody.
2
Welcome back to the number one podcast in the world, the all-in podcast.
3
Today, the original squad is back.
4
No guests, just full contact Sachs is back.
5
We're going to break down a number of topics today, including chaos in the bond market, as Republicans seemingly have abandoned the Doge agenda.
6
And we're going to debate the big, beautiful bill, which is going to add trillions to our national debt.
7
And it's a new era for Google as they release an AI-first search product.
8
OpenAI has acquired Johnny Ives company, IO, to make some sort of gadget.
9
They've paid over $6 billion.
10
Is this the real deal or not?
11
You're going to find out today.
12
And is energy the solution to every problem we have?
13
One besties got a very interesting take.
14
All that and more on the number one podcast in the world.
15
Stick with us.
16
For the fourth year in a row, we're going to do the all-in summit.
17
If you guys remember, four years ago, I decided, hey, let's do a summit.
18
And then these three besties were like, no, we don't want to do a summit.
19
Now it's become a big thing and everybody loves it.
20
September 7th to 9th in Los Angeles.
21
I'm going to give you credit for that, TikTok.
22
Yeah, after you gave me hell for a year.
23
Okay.
24
It sounds like an apology, but okay, sure.
25
I'm sorry.
26
You're wonderful and I appreciate what you created.
27
Thank you very much.
28
Wow.
29
Finally, some credit.
30
Okay.
31
We all know the goal of the summit is to have the world's most important conversations, and this year will be no different.
32
Yada, yada, yada.
33
Allin.com/slash summit.
34
If you would like to apply to come.
35
Why do you say the most important conversations and then say yada, yada, yada as a way to dismiss it?
36
Do you think that that increases your salesmanship and effectiveness?
37
I don't want to be getting grand pronouncements here, but these have been important conversations we've had, and it's been pretty great.
38
I have to say, yada, yada, yada.
39
No, it's just like they put like 18 things in the plugs now, and I don't want to do too much.
40
Well, why don't you do a modicum of work before you get on camera and actually edit it?
41
Here we go.
42
I get one compliment.
43
That's exactly it.
44
He doesn't do the homework, so he runs out of work.
45
He's like, we got the biggest names to come to our summit.
46
The vice president came, he said, yada, yada, yada.
47
Elon Musk showed up in person, yada, yada, yada.
48
Of course, an astronaut, Freedomberg, Weston Smith.
49
Yada, yada, yada.
50
Yada, yada, yada.
51
But this year it will be no different.
52
We'll have incredible parties, blah, blah, blah.
53
And let's get to work.
54
Okay.
55
The president did a trip to the Middle East.
56
Yada, yada, yada.
57
Needing more peace, a whole new framework.
58
America's going to be a good thing.
59
Yada, yada, yada, yada.
60
World's greatest moderator, yada, yada, yada.
61
Executive Commission for Life deal with it, Friedberg.
62
Okay.
63
All right, let's win the contract.
64
What your winners, Ride.
65
Rainman David Sack.
66
And I said, We open source it to the fans, and they're just going to raise him before.
67
WS is queen of being bonded.
68
All right, let's get to work here.
69
The bond market is the captain.
70
Apparently, the Treasury Department sold $16 billion worth of newly issued 20-year bonds on Wednesday afternoon, and there was weak demand.
71
This pushed yields higher across the board.
72
The 10-year, which Best has said to focus on because it's the benchmark rate for most borrowing costs, you know, mortgages and stuff like that.
73
It spiked, and here it is.
74
It actually hit a five-handle at one point.
75
A lot of people were hand-wringing about this, and the SP dropped 1.5% in about 30 minutes.
76
Here's that chart as well.
77
And the three major indices were all down between 1.5 and 2% on the day.
78
Obviously, in related news, the House passed the big, beautiful bill at the 11th hour last night.
79
This makes the TCGJA tax cuts permanent.
80
And it's estimated to increase long-run GDP by 60 basis points.
81
That's it.
82
All the cuts were implemented.
83
And it's going to add between $3 and $5 trillion to the national debt over 10 years.
84
Freebreak, what's your take on the triple B and the bonds, weak bond market, all of it?
85
I just want to take a quick primer on how the government gets funded.
86
I know we assume everyone understands it, but I think it's important for folks to really grok it.
87
For the federal government to make payments to employees and contractors and buy stuff, they need to put money in their bank accounts.
88
And the way they put money in their bank accounts is they issue bonds.
89
These are treasury bonds.
90
So they'll sell treasury bonds to the public.
91
And individuals buy it, companies buy it, banks buy it, and foreign governments buy U.S.
92
treasuries.
93
And they transfer or wire cash into the federal government's bank accounts, which they can then use to pay for stuff.
94
And then the Treasury Department needs to continuously sell treasuries to raise cash to fund the government.
95
When folks don't show up to buy treasuries, that's a bad thing.
96
And that means that the government needs to increase the interest rate that they're paying on those bonds.
97
So what we saw on Wednesday was a really weak demand signal for treasuries on this modest treasury auction.
98
Selling $16 billion of bonds is not a lot.
99
There's hundreds of billions being sold each quarter.
100
And so this was not a big number, but there was no buyer.
101
The market was really dry.
102
And so everyone that participates in financial markets saw this and freaked out.
103
And the big motivation, the big understanding of the relationship here is, to your point, that this big tax bill and spending bill is passing out of the house.
104
debt over time, which makes it more difficult for the U.S.
105
government to pay its bills because it has to issue more debt.
106
Interest payments have to be paid every year, and so on.
107
Now, if you just pull up this one slide, this is something I thought was really worth sharing.
108
The CBO estimates, which is what you referenced, Jason, are estimates of what the cost is going to be over time.
109
And this is from Jessica Riedel or Reidel out of the Manhattan Institute put this chart together.
110
Congressional Budget Office.
111
Yeah, so the Congressional Budget Office, the CBO, creates an estimate of the budget, the spending, the deficit, and ultimately the incremental debt that the U.S.
112
government will need to issue to fund its obligations over time.
113
This is a chart that was put together that the expectation on a baseline basis is that over the next 30 years or so, U.S.
114
debt to GDP will climb to 203%.
115
But what a lot of people don't know and don't talk about is that in the CBO estimates, they assume in all of their models that interest rates are at 3.6%.
116
And with the bond sell-off yesterday, what we are now seeing is 30-year Treasury interest rates at over 5%.
117
It's 5.1% this morning.
118
And for every incremental 1% above 3.6%, you're spending an extra $350 billion a year in interest.
119
$350 billion a year.
120
So as we go up by 1.5% interest over the next 10 years, we're spending another $5 trillion just on interest payments, half a billion dollars, half a trillion dollars a year of incremental interest on the difference between.
121
And I say recursive because the incremental interest that we now have to pay, because interest rates just went up, because the market is demanding more payments from the government to fund us, means that the government has to issue more debt and it quickly gets away from you.
122
There is a non-linear relationship between the deficit and interest rates, which drives up the debt problem in a non-linear way, and it gets away from you, and you can't fix it.
123
And that's what the market is telling us: that the current bill that's being passed out of the House is showing such an extraordinarily high deficit that the market does not want to buy the debt from the government.
124
Rates are now climbing, and that creates a massive problem for the government.
125
Okay, Shamath, you've been tweeting about this.
126
We thought we were going to get an administration and maybe some focus from the government that we would have more austerity measures, balance the budget.
127
Now it looks like we're going to pour gasoline on the fire.
128
What are your thoughts?
129
I think we have to be careful here.
130
So, Jason, the political calculus will be for the president to decide how much credit he actually wants to take for this bill.
131
Because even though it has his name on it, the contents of the bill are different in actual facts than what I think he intended.
132
And what I mean by that is when you look inside of what happened in the 11th hour last night, it's disappointing.
133
This thing is like anti-Doge.
134
If Doge was meant to be a reflection of the American voting population's desire for meaningful reform in government, cost controls, this is the opposite of that.
135
What happened was in the 11th hour, you had a handful of people abstain.
136
You had one person that passed away in the last few days.
137
You had one person that fell asleep on the floor of the house, so he wasn't even woken up for the vote.
138
And in the middle of all of that chaos, what happened was all kinds of things were added and attached and canceled at the last minute.
139
Because what happens is you have to have these puts and takes, as Freeberg described.
140
If you want to spend over here, you have to find a cut over there.
141
But I think what happened was there was really not a lot of financial literacy used to decide what to actually put in and what to cut.
142
And that lack of discipline is going to create, I think, a negative set of consequences.
143
So what are those consequences?
144
Today, the 10-year is around 4.5%.
145
At the rate in which it's escalating since Liberation Day, by the end of this year, we're going to be past 5%.
146
The 30-year is on a rate now to get past 6.25%, maybe even reach 6.5%.
147
Those are way beyond what most people thought was a reasonable place to be for the United States economy.
148
And so, what will the implications be as rates go to those levels?
149
You'll delever from the United States.
150
You'll sell U.S.
151
debt.
152
You'll own things like gold and Bitcoin.
153
If you're curious about what's happening to gold and Bitcoin, they started to spike in the last few days.
154
You'll have ratings organizations that add to this cascade by downgrading the United States.
155
That happened on Friday.
156
You'll have very smart people starting to signal that this is a much harder problem than they initially thought.
157
That's how I personally interpreted Elon's comments over the last few days.
158
So, what was the House supposed to do?
159
I think what they were supposed to do was implement some form of austerity.
160
They were supposed to, by the will of the people, pass a rescission bill.
161
They were given that rescission bill.
162
It was just $9 billion.
163
They couldn't even pass a $9 billion rescission.
164
And instead, they passed a $4 trillion inflation to our debt.
165
Now, you hand this to the Senate.
166
The Senate is in a very difficult place as well.
167
Do they want to, quote-unquote, claim victory and say, here you go, President Trump, here's your bill.
168
But they'll further bastardize this thing, and it will be even further away from what I think benefits MAGA and benefits Main Street.
169
So, who does it benefit?
170
Current course and speed right now, this bill is about traditional Republicans and traditional Democrats circling the wagon and putting on a platter a set of things that I think will be hurtful to average Americans.
171
You're going to see energy prices spike.
172
You're gutting the number of electrons that will be available for things like AI.
173
You're going to increase Medicare prices.
174
And the math is wrong.
175
So, when you sensitize this thing to a four and a half or five or 5.24 rate, so meaning not what the CBO used, but the real conditions on the ground, this thing is an albatross.
176
And I think, unfortunately, for President Trump's agenda and for a MAGA movement, this is the worst of all conditions.
177
The financial markets will punish this.
178
And then the last thing I'll say is now, to top it all off, I think that Jerome Powell will see the writing on the wall.
179
Many aspects of this thing are inflationary.
180
And if they're not handled well by the Senate, he has a lot of room to actually increase interest rates.
181
So I would just say that the Senate has an incredibly difficult job.
182
I think the President has an even more difficult job about what to do right now, but the House did nobody favors.
183
They did not do anybody a favor yesterday.
184
Here's the prediction from Polymarket on what will happen to Fed rate cuts in 2025.
185
It's across the board.
186
It seems like nobody can tell if it's going to be zero, one, two, or three, 20, 22, 25, and 15%, respectively, for those four options.
187
Sachs, you don't speak for President Trump.
188
You're the czar of AI and crypto specifically.
189
So let's put that out there.
190
But I'm curious your thoughts on what happened with Doge.
191
Why are we continuing to spend ourselves into oblivion?
192
And what will the downstream issues be here?
193
Because this sounds like it's going to be inflationary.
194
This sounds like it's going to be hard for people to buy homes.
195
It's going to create more austerity in the future.
196
How bad is this?
197
Do you feel it's as bad as Dave and Shamath are framing it?
198
Well, look, I mean, I wish.
199
The Democrats all want a lot more spending and a lot more taxes.
200
Remember, if it wasn't for Manchin Sinema, we would have had that $4.5 trillion bill back better.
201
And among the Republicans in the House, unfortunately, we have a bunch of Republicans who are pretty soft on spending, and you can call them rhinos if you want.
202
And we only have, what, like a three-vote margin in the House, and the Democrats are not cooperating in any way.
203
So you don't have that many votes to spare.
204
So what I'm saying here is you can't make the perfect the enemy the good.
205
I think you have to be realistic about how much we can get done here.
206
And I do think that this bill does contain a lot of good things in it.
207
There are a lot of priorities for the administration in here.
208
Do I wish it cut spending more?
209
Yes.
210
I mean, do I wish that it made all the Doge cuts permanent through rescissions?
211
Yeah, absolutely.
212
I think it's outrageous that there were enough House Republicans who didn't want to back up Doge that that wasn't enacted.
213
But there are a lot of good things in the bill, and I should just highlight them for balance here.
214
So the number one thing here is that this bill will permanently extend the 2017 tax cuts.
215
And if we don't pass this bill, let's just assume that we do nothing.
216
Okay, if we do nothing, you're going to get the largest tax increase in decades.
217
And it won't just affect the rich.
218
This affects the middle class as well.
219
The 2017 tax cuts increased the standard deduction, which is important for the middle class.
220
It raised the child tax credit.
221
So, again, if you do nothing, you get a huge tax increase as soon as the 2017 tax cuts, which Trump passed back in his first term, when they sunset.
222
In addition, there are promises here that were made during the campaign to eliminate taxes on tips and overtime that have been enacted.
223
And the president promised to do those things, and he is accomplishing those things.
224
So, I think that's important.
225
There's funding for the border wall here: 10,000 new ICE officers, more detention beds, and so on.
226
On energy, it repeals the methane tax and unlocks new oil and gas on federal lands.
227
And there's a bunch of other things as well.
228
So, there are a lot of good things in here.
229
Now, to Tamas' point, will this bill be bad for the Republicans' prospects in the midterms?
230
I guess what I would say to that is: I don't understand how you expect to do well in the midterms if Republicans preside over the largest tax increase in decades.
231
A tax increase that Joe Biden tried to get during his administration.
232
Biden tried to raise taxes and couldn't get the votes for it.
233
But if we don't make those tax cuts permanent, if we allow the sunset to happen, then you will accomplish what Joe Biden could not, which is to raise taxes on the American people.
234
So, look, no bill like this that's passed by a one-vote margin on straight party lines when you only have a three-vote margin in the entire House is going to satisfy everyone.
235
Here, let me ask you a question there.
236
You have Trump at his peak power.
237
You have all these threats of, hey, we're going to primary anybody if they don't do like what we're saying here.
238
Why isn't Trump just coming in and using his power and just saying, hey, not big enough, get back to work, we need to cut spending, period, full stop.
239
And he's got that power.
240
I don't hear him saying that.
241
I do think that there are ways to enact the tax cuts and make them permanent.
242
And I think that that is a good part of.
243
And that's all of the nonsense where I'll just be honest.
244
I think the people in the House are not nearly as financially literate as they need to be.
245
And I think what they wanted to do was pass something and throw it over the wall and say, mission accomplished.
246
Now it's up to the Senate.
247
And the good news is: look, the Senate has these six-year election cycles for a reason.
248
It allows them to think strategically and see past what's right in front of them.
249
So I still think that there's a chance for the president to have his cake and eat it too.
250
But I just want to highlight that as a supporter of his and a supporter of that MAGA agenda, which I think a lot of people voted for, I just want to be honest and say this is not it.
251
And there has to be some meaningful reforms in the Senate version of this thing that gets sent back to the House.
252
So I'll give you an example of one.
253
81% of the incremental energy that's generated in the United States last year came from private enterprises that were investing in short-term forms of power that have a credit and a transfer market tied to it.
254
This is just the financial machinery.
255
This is how Blackstone and Goldman Sachs and Brookfield and all of these big players move tens and hundreds of billions of dollars around.
256
They changed those rules at the 11th hour.
257
What is the impact of that?
258
Elon foreshadowed it.
259
Nick, maybe you can show the headline of the article.
260
He said, we could be running into a power capacity.
261
Now, if we knew that, why would we take the short-term incentive away to generate more electrons?
262
All the great things that David has done, that the president has done on AI, I mean, we'll talk about what happened in the Middle East.
263
But when the rubber meets the road and you actually have a shortage of electrons, because these financial actors, they're not, you know, and in fairness to them, they're acting rationally.
264
You take the financial incentive away and you can't underwrite this thing.
265
What are they going to do?
266
They're just going to stop doing it.
267
So, in the absence of electrons, what happens?
268
Prices go up.
269
It's inflationary.
270
And now you'll have to allocate electrons.
271
Does the electrons go to an AI data center or does it go to a home?
272
In a different example, actually on the residential side, places like Florida, I think there was like an incentive for like batteries.
273
So if you're about to get hit by a hurricane, you can buy these big battery systems from Tesla, as an example, but there are other ones, Generac and whatever, Train.
274
That was cut out.
275
And so in Texas, all of these impacts will have negative consequences.
276
My point is, I think you have to really look at what happened in the 11th hour and fix those things because the problem with these plans is you can't look at gains that are in years six through 10 to justify pain in years one through five.
277
You can't do that because I understand how that mathematically makes sense.
278
It doesn't make sense practically for the average American.
279
It's just not how life works.
280
You don't go into a J-curve.
281
You know, we do that as investors, right?
282
But you don't do that as a normal American, which is be on the wrong side.
283
I asked Shamat the question: Shouldn't Trump use his capital that's built up here and say not good enough, make some cuts here?
284
What would you say to President Trump if he was asking you for your advice, Friedberg?
285
I think the writings on the wall that the system is winning and the rebels came in and they tried to fix the inefficiencies in government with Doge under Elon's leadership and our friend Antonio's participation and a great group of individuals who are true patriots who are spending time trying to help reassess how the government operates.
286
And they, as I've said from day one, from my first visit to DC during inauguration weekend and every visit I've done since then, I always leave after meeting with members of Congress deeply worried that they won't actually do what they need to do to make the changes.
287
And the last line of defense ultimately is the president with his veto authority and his ability to tell people to go back, rethink this, and cut spending.
288
I feel like we're in a last-ditch effort.
289
And I'll tell you why I say it's last-ditch.
290
I think that there's a relationship between what's going on in the United States and what's going on in Japan.
291
Nick, if you'll pull up the Japanese government four-year bond yield chart, so just so you guys can kind of observe, in the last couple of days, we've seen Japanese bond yields soar from 2.5% to 3.5%.
292
Remember, Japan owns $1.1 trillion of U.S.
293
treasuries.
294
I'll just read a quote from a guy who's the chief global strategist named Albert Edwards at Society Generale.
295
And he said, recent developments in Japan may signal the end of the 2008 global financial crisis, potentially reshaping global financial landscapes in the coming months.
296
Can I translate that?
297
Because it's incredibly important, what Friedberg said, but I'll translate that.
298
What he is saying: so, this is a guy from SochGen.
299
Since 2007, 2008, every now and then the markets give you free money.
300
One of the most obvious free money trades was the yen-carry trade.
301
And in order to execute that trade, you're effectively leveraging treasuries against the Japanese bond market.
302
What he is saying is that there is increasing risk that that trade unwinds.
303
When that trade unwinds, what you're going to have are net sellers of up to, as Friedberg said, a trillion plus dollars of U.S.
304
treasuries.
305
What will that do?
306
It will further exacerbate the market's reluctance to own U.S.
307
Treasuries, which means yields go even higher.
308
Which means interest rates for businesses and individuals go higher.
309
And the only way to keep those interest rates low will be for the Federal Reserve to try and step in and buy those bonds, which will devalue the dollar.
310
And in his commentary, he went on to say that the 20-year Japanese bond auction that just took place, similar to the U.S.
311
Treasury auction that just took place, was the worst they've seen since 1987.
312
That's how significant this event was in Japan over the past week.
313
So the massive climb in bond yields in Japan indicates a massive sell-off in credit.
314
And remember, if you look at the historical perspective, when the global reserve currency nation sees their debt sell on.
315
And any one of these markets can cause a cataclysmic follow-on to the rest of the global financial markets.
316
Like, if Japan sells off too much, we are going to start to see a lot of unraveling happening.
317
That's the consequence, I think, of this particular bill because it signals a lack of a reluctance to actually address.
318
Let me say something here.
319
I called Freeberg today on the way here.
320
It's very rare that he and I agree about this kind of stuff because normally what I say is, you're catastrophizing.
321
Sure.
322
Calm down.
323
But this is where I will say, I'll put my money where my mouth is, and I'll put the chips on the table to say, this is the moment.
324
This is the moment where we either re-underwrite what we voted for or we mistakenly pass this Christmas tree concoction.
325
It does have President Trump's signature on the top of it.
326
It does have some features that he asked for.
327
But what I hope he sees and realizes is the details here matter.
328
And without some technical maneuvering in the Senate, this is a bad bill as constructed.
329
And if it passes, forget what any of us think, the bond markets will act decisively and they are going to go in one direction.
330
And it's away from us.
331
And I just hope that we figure this out.
332
Seems like a classic diffusion of responsibility here.
333
So actually, you have Congress, Senate, and POTIS not willing to step up and say, let's cut the spending.
334
Well, I don't think that's fair.
335
I mean, look, the president backed up Elon and Does.
336
There's a limit, though, to what he can do.
337
Congress has the power of the purse.
338
And we said on a previous episode that at the end of the day, for the Doge cuts to become permanent, Congress has to incorporate that into the budget.
339
And the reality is there are still a number of these like old bull appropriators on the Republican side who just are not wired to make spending cuts.
340
But why are we hearing him vocally saying, stop this maddenance?
341
He is the most vocal guy in the world who mixes in every topic on the planet.
342
Why is he going to be able to do that?
343
Well, let's give him the benefit of the doubt.
344
Let's give him the benefit of the doubt.
345
He's probably working it all in the back channel.
346
There are the things that he wants, and he's in the midst of negotiating as well.
347
But my point is just this.
348
The level of financial illiteracy in this bill will come back to bite America in the ass.
349
Look, here's the problem is that what you guys want to sell right now is austerity.
350
And the reality is that the politicians in Washington just are not buying austerity right now.
351
I mean, that's what you want is austerity.
352
Yep.
353
And the reality is the only way you get true austerity, like a painful set of changes, is when both parties link arms and jump off the cliff together and make those changes.
354
The Democrats right now have no willingness to do that.
355
They're opposed to doing this.
356
This is a straight line party reconciliation vote.
357
I think you're trying to overload this vote with way too much stuff.
358
You're trying to basically say that this vote has to fix America's fiscal problems.
359
It's just not going to happen.
360
I mean, look, I agree with you that the fiscal situation needs to get fixed.
361
This is just not the vote where it's going to happen.
362
You cannot exacerbate it.
363
Well, I don't know.
364
I mean, look, I understand that this doesn't have as much stuff as we want.
365
I mean, like I said, let's say the alternative is just do nothing.
366
That is actually meaningfully worse because you will get a massive tax increase, massive.
367
I think President Trump inherited a Biden economy that was already feeling pretty shaky.
368
I don't know what the argument is for a massive tax increase in an economy that's not doing great.
369
I'd rather see the tax cuts made permanent.
370
I'd rather see the no tax on tips and overtime implemented, important campaign promises.
371
I'd rather see funding for the border wall.
372
I mean, these are all important things that we need to have happen.
373
And I just don't think that this bill is how you're going to solve it.
374
But what I'm saying is, why do you pay for that with electron supply for homes and AI?
375
I don't know.
376
I mean, you're talking about a pretty esoteric issue, Chama.
377
This is not the same as solving the U.S.
378
budget.
379
Why do it by doing Medicaid cuts?
380
Why?
381
Well, let's solve it to Medicaid cuts.
382
First of all, I mean, you're being a little bit schizophrenic about this.
383
I mean, you guys are saying that you want to see more cuts, but then you also believe that the Medicaid cuts are a bad idea.
384
So you've got to kind of choose.
385
I'm not saying that.
386
I think all cuts are great.
387
All medical spending cuts across the board.
388
Yeah, cuts across the board.
389
Spread it out.
390
You got to decide what you're opposed to.
391
Are you opposed to cuts or you want more of them?
392
I want more cuts.
393
And given the fiscal situation, I'm actually, if someone showed up and said, hey, we're going to increase taxes, I'd say that's what we got to do right now.
394
Everyone's got to take a hit on this.
395
But hey, I know I'm going to be alone in that.
396
So I'm not going to try and make that argument.
397
I guess the question for you, Saxon, is I agree with you.
398
Well, let me ask you a question, Sax.
399
What do you think is the moment when the two parties lock arms and do jump together?
400
What is the conditions that need to be kind of prevalent for us to take, you know, draconian austerity measures?
401
Probably the bond market forces it on the politicians, forces it on Washington.
402
Yeah.
403
I think you're right.
404
with Japan and so on?
405
Don't you think that the market's telling us that this might be the moment?
406
It could be the moment, but I remember the first week of April when Larry Summers came on the pod and said that the markets were melting down.
407
And that was a different moment that he was trying to sell in favor of his policy.
408
So my point is just there's market volatility, and we won't know for a while whether this means anything.
409
It could just be a blip.
410
So, look, you asked me, what are the conditions for getting austerity?
411
I think that austerity will have to be imposed on Washington from the outside.
412
Washington's not going to find the will internally.
413
We had a wonderful moment here where you have Elon come in with Doge, which the president made possible.
414
No other president would even have done this.
415
Agree.
416
Big credit for that.
417
Big credit.
418
Where you get a total outsider to come in and bring a team of like young, big, bald geniuses, and you let them go through these departments line by line and start deleting things.
419
Okay.
420
And they made, I think, great progress.
421
I think they found $160 billion a year of cuts that can be made administratively.
422
Beyond that, they need Congress to approve it.
423
And I will acknowledge that there are still a number of soft, unspending, rhino Republicans, and there's just not a majority for the types of austerity and cuts that you guys would like to see.
424
I mean, that's the reality.
425
But I still think that the question with this bill is just how pure you want to be.
426
My point is just: are you going to make the perfect the enemy of the good?
427
I don't think you're going to get austerity out of Washington right now.
428
It's just not in the cards.
429
The question is whether this bill is basically better than the status quo.
430
To your point, without opining on it, I think what's going to happen is the bond market will sensitize this budget at real rates.
431
They're not going to use the 3.6 that Freeborough pointed to.
432
They're just going to re-underwrite this at five, five and a quarter, five and a half.
433
That is a very different risk exposure, I think.
434
And so to your point, they'll react.
435
If it looks like it passes as is, then that's what they'll do.
436
And to your point, David, we'll know in the next 60 to 90 days.
437
Trevor Burrus, Jr.: Let's say that this is just a book in the market and it's not some larger once-in-a-century type event.
438
The reality is we don't know exactly what's going to happen.
439
Look, I don't like America's fiscal picture at all, but what if the AI and robotics revolution plays out in the most optimistic way over the next decade and is massively deflationary, and we get basically AI-powered robots expanding the economy massively?
440
You need power for that.
441
I get that, and we need to do power generation for sure.
442
But my point is just: what if the new technology provides an answer to the fiscal situation that's not currently on the table?
443
I think it's a good idea.
444
So, this is my point: is Washington's not going to embrace.
445
I understand, but you're going to have brownouts and blackouts of average human homes to do that?
446
No, you shouldn't have to make these decisions.
447
Those are dumb trade-offs.
448
You're not going to be able to solve the power generation problem in a reconciliation bill.
449
And I want to just add my two cents at the end here.
450
Leadership starts at the top.
451
This president acts unilaterally all the time, whether it's immigration, DEI, he has no problem.
452
And this is what he is doing.
453
He's endorsing this bill.
454
He's saying it's big, it's beautiful.
455
He is saying this is historic.
456
I think this is bad leadership.
457
I'll just say it straight out.
458
He was elected.
459
He's going to put more onto the debt and sat here on this very podcast, the four of us, and said this was the most important issue on the world.
460
And Trump is putting gasoline on the fire.
461
I think it's bad leadership.
462
Let's continue on the docket.
463
I suggest you look at the Constitution because the power of the purse rests with Congress.
464
He's endorsing this.
465
He's endorsing it.
466
He's not even putting up a fight.
467
When it comes to immigration and these other areas, the president has far more unilateral power, and he's used that every chance he gets.
468
But when it comes to spending, you have to get Congress on board.
469
This is a bill that passed with a one-vote margin.
470
I don't know where you think the opportunity is to squeeze out more concessions from Congress.
471
I don't think that's a good question.
472
He could speak up.
473
He could speak up and say, do better.
474
He's doing the opposite.
475
He's doing the opposite.
476
This bill passed by a one-vote margin.
477
It was hanging on by a thread.
478
And if it failed, you get basically hundreds of billions of tax increases, which we don't need right now.
479
It's not even a matter of time.
480
I think he's trying.
481
In terms of Republican prospects, look, people vote for Republicans to do two things, cut taxes and cut spending.
482
I wish that this bill did two out of two.
483
It does one out of two with some of the second one, like with the Medicaid stuff.
484
If we didn't at least cut taxes, there'd be no reason to vote for Republicans.
485
None.
486
Y'all are much closer to him than I am.
487
Y'all should be challenging him to not endorse this and to do the opposite.
488
That would be the profile encouragement.
489
Then we get the biggest tax increase in that time.
490
Great.
491
No, he should just go to everybody and say, do better.
492
I don't agree with that tactic.
493
I think the better tactic is to do what he did, but then work behind the scenes and help the Senate implement the technical guardrails that make the bill better than it has.
494
Now, I think the opportunity is to understand these puts and takes with a little bit more detail and a little bit more mathematical precision and fix it.
495
So I still hold out hope that we're going to get to a better place, but he's going to have much more influence, Jason, by actually taking the positive path than throwing everybody under the bus.
496
The real question will be in 30 days or 45 days: what is the final version of this thing?
497
And whatever gets passed and signed by him, there will have been enough time to understand it.
498
And you'll see the real-time reactions.
499
All I'm trying to indicate is I think that this was a moment where people were very pensively optimistic that the approach of Doge would really be embraced and that we see some broad-scale attempts to at least, and Freebrook said this, just to go back to 2019, even if we don't do anything else, just go back to 2019, pretend COVID didn't happen.
500
Yeah, and we would be, by the way, if we did that, we would have a budget surplus and the bonds would be trading down to 2% yields again.
501
I mean, we would be in such an incredible condition.
502
We've got 2% inflation right now.
503
Anyway, we don't need to beat the dead horse.
504
Let's move on.
505
I wish there were 218 members of the House who thought like that.
506
I hear you.
507
I hear you.
508
Oh, gosh.
509
Listen, this guy is saying he's going to primary anybody who, you know, Jason, I don't think it's right.
510
He should be speaking up right now.
511
I'll tell you what, give him the line item veto and then let's talk.
512
Right.
513
How about you saying, guys, spend less money?
514
He doesn't have to throw them under the bus, Jamaic.
515
It could be something very subtle.
516
But you make it that way.
517
The way that you position it is like you make it such a black and white thing, and it's, I think, is a black and white.
518
He's a lot of people.
519
This is a great bill.
520
No, but what I'm saying is.
521
And what you're saying is he should virtue signal and prognosticate in public.
522
And I'm saying that I never said that's what you're asking him to do.
523
No, I'm not.
524
I'm asking him to say reduce spending in the bill because that's good for America.
525
This bill cuts $880 billion for Medicaid over a decade, which is something that already is politically tough and controversial.
526
It imposes work requirements for able-bodied adults.
527
This is similar to what Bill Clinton did back in 1996 with welfare reform, basically saying that you can't be a layabout and get welfare.
528
So these are relatively tough things to do politically.
529
It's like, do I want to see even more cuts?
530
Yeah, absolutely.
531
But again, when you have a one-vote margin, whose vote are you going to pick up by doing more cuts?
532
I guess you get Thomas Massey, maybe, but you probably have to go all the way to balance the budget to get his vote.
533
I don't know what it takes to get a Thomas Massey vote.
534
So I don't know what votes you think you're going to pick up by cutting even more.
535
And we can't afford to lose even one vote.
536
It's literally the artist.
537
I will move on.
538
But if you're going to tell me I'm asking virtual signal, you're going to lie about my position.
539
I will correct you.
540
It's been 40 minutes.
541
So my position is not to virtue signal.
542
It's to go flip a couple people and say do better.
543
Okay.
544
It was a huge week for AI again.
545
Google and the ghost of Steve Jobs took center stage.
546
Let's start with Google here.
547
They had their I.O.
548
conference on Tuesday.
549
This is where they show a bunch of new stuff.
550
They get developers to come together to embrace their products.
551
And the stock ripped 5% on the day, which might be a turning point for Google and up again today.
552
Search was the big announcement, and we had a discussion with Sergei about that in Miami.
553
And we had.
554
They demoed something called AI mode, no, not found remote, AI mode, and they compared it to regular search.
555
Here it is on the screen if you're watching this on YouTube or Spotify, a very elegant app.
556
And so, here you have somebody searching, and what you can see is in AI mode, it looks like a nice comprehensive search instead of 10 blue links and tons of advertising.
557
So, you can flip over and see all, or you can do a perplexity-like search here.
558
We're showing you what this search would have looked like: the AI summary at the top, and then your 10 blue links.
559
It's distinctly different.
560
It is exactly, Chamath, what you talked about.
561
Somebody has to have the courage to flip the switch here.
562
And so, that was the big drop.
563
And I think that in your interview, Dave, didn't Sundar say we're going to integrate ads into that kind of result?
564
Yes, the comprehensive search result?
565
I think there were a couple of things that Sundar said in the interview that showed up in a really important way at I.O.
566
The first was exactly this, which is to make AI mode more ubiquitous in search and effectively, over time, replace search with this AI mode experience, which they've been testing in a small group, and now they've expanded very specifically to kind of Chamoth's point a couple of weeks ago, they should probably flip the switch.
567
Well, it appears they've done that.
568
The key question and the challenge has always been: what's the revenue per query?
569
How are you going to make money?
570
And I think one of the other kind of interesting announcements that we saw come out of I.O., which indicates the business model opportunity here, is not just AI mode and search, but some of the other tools that they've launched, bundling them together.
571
And they have this product offering called AI Ultra for $250 a month that includes, you know, YouTube Premium, it includes 30 terabytes of storage on your Google.
572
It includes access to Flow, which is their movie creating AI model where you can use, they have VO3, Gemini, and Imogen below it.
573
Those are the three models that contribute to this movie creation studio tool.
574
And they've launched a number of other kind of high-value Gemini models as standalone research apps.
575
And you can get access to all of these kind of high-powered tools for $250.
576
So I do think this sets a new direction that Google is likely testing as a business model, which is a very high-dollar volume subscription model for consumers that over time could create a very meaningful shift in the revenue mix for Google away from ads and more towards subscription revenue that we already see in some of the consumer services like YouTube and YouTube TV.
577
This is, I think, a really important turning point.
578
I would say if anyone were to identify the week that Google really pivoted into the AI business model, it might be this week.
579
They launched over 15 products at this thing.
580
And another important one I'll highlight, Sundar talked about this in the interview I did with him.
581
In the early days of Google, from 2002 till about 2011, Google had this kind of playground of products called Google Labs, where they would introduce new stuff.
582
I don't know if you guys remember checking out this new stuff.
583
So they relaunched Google Labs like a year ago or so.
584
And as Sundar said, they're putting a lot more stuff in labs.
585
So labs is now becoming the new testbed.
586
And they launched a bunch of the announcements in labs.
587
So that becomes the place where they'll say, what's the business model?
588
What's the use case?
589
Do people like it?
590
Do they love it?
591
If they do, it graduates out of labs into full production.
592
And I think that opens up the opportunity for some of the things like Jamaic was talking about, where they could experiment with new ideas, new modalities, and then productize them if they were.
593
And they discontinued labs in 2011.
594
Here they put the AI search up in the top bar.
595
We have images, video shopping, et cetera, news.
596
We're all familiar with that.
597
What do you think?
598
Just swap out I'm Feeling Lucky for Delight Me with AI, and or maybe just if you were a product manager there because you've done a lot of great product work in your career before you were in politics, would you just A-B test this and say, anybody who, let's say, doesn't click on ads, let's send them to the AI search and just see how they do because they don't click on ads anyway, and then just let the ad clickers keep going to the ad product.
599
Well, I think we were all calling on previous podcasts for Google to risk disrupting their dominance in search by moving to more of an AI-based model.
600
And I think they've taken an important step in that direction.
601
They've sort of thread the needle here between keeping their old UI and product and then also incorporating the new sort of AI UI.
602
So this is a compromise.
603
I mean, they're trying to have their cake and eat it too.
604
It ultimately feels a little bit like a transitional move.
605
I doubt that this will be the end point, but given their need to protect their search business while also developing their AI business, this feels like a pretty good compromise, I think.
606
I mean, it certainly shows that they're in the game and they're not going to get caught totally flat-footed and let the whole world disrupt them while they're trying to figure out AI.
607
I mean, they are responding now, and the market seemed to like it.
608
I think they were up like 5% on this news.
609
Yeah, and then up again today.
610
Jamath, we talked about having some design sense and maybe some bravery here.
611
Looks like they're pretty much on the market.
612
When you look at them, I would say I would like to have that as my default, I think, when I'm doing search.
613
What do you think of the product we're showing you here again?
614
And what do you think the roadmap will be?
615
I gave one possibility.
616
Sachs is totally right.
617
I think that this is not the destination, but they've taken a really important step.
618
And now they have to follow through.
619
We all know what has to happen.
620
So I think we're all just going to debate when it happens.
621
And I think what the market is betting is that it's going to happen in the next 18 months.
622
So, what is it exactly?
623
It's when AI mode becomes the default for a large swath of existing Google users.
624
How will we know that happens?
625
They're probably running A-B tests right now.
626
They're probably gauging behavioral patterns of which kinds of users, what the actual impacts to search are, and what impacts exist to CPCs, to cost per click, which is one of the inventory types that they sell.
627
But I think this is the beginning of a process.
628
I suspect it'll be done in less than a year.
629
And for a large swath of users, they are going to put AI in the front door.
630
I think that's a fait de compli.
631
I think we're just now debating the mechanics of getting there per how Sachs alluded to it.
632
That's a really powerful step.
633
But here, Jason, I think I go back to what they also have to keep in mind.
634
What you don't want to have when you are going through an innovator's dilemma is to have the competitor be onto the next lily pad while you are figuring out the current lily pad.
635
And the reason I bring this up, and I'm sure we'll talk about this, is it's impressive what Sam Altman is doing right now at OpenAI.
636
I don't know if it was a troll or not, but to buy I.O., Johnny Ives' firm at the end of Google I.O.
637
And I read an article that said OpenAI has been trying to do this for a couple years in a row.
638
But what Sam alluded to in that video was some next-gen whiz-bang device that they've been working on that was the industrial logic for the MA.
639
I think what you don't want to have happen if you're Google is to finally get the search thing right and then now have to play catch up on some device.
640
So I would encourage them to just run the A-B tests and shorten the window of measurement.
641
I think we all know what has to happen.
642
So it's probably better to just do it sooner than later and then start to allocate the incremental resources to these new form factors and other things so that they shorten the distance between them and OpenAI.
643
Let me tee up exactly what happened.
644
OpenAI, they're the makers of ChatGPT, bought Johnny Ives startup.
645
The startup is called I.O., they bought it for $6.5 billion in an all-stock deal.
646
If you remember, Johnny Ives was Steve Jobs' collaborator and designer, iPhone, iPod, iPad, all that beautiful stuff.
647
So OpenAI is buying I.O.
648
I.O.
649
is not love from, if you've heard about that, that's his design agency.
650
And so they did a really interesting rom-com video.
651
I don't know if you guys saw this.
652
It's incredibly quality and ridiculous.
653
Let's play it.
654
Here are two people having a meet cue.
655
Dude, you're right.
656
It's like a love story.
657
It literally is like a meet cue.
658
Here comes Sam.
659
Here's what I've said about Sam.
660
Johnny Ives is like, I've never met a man who's so brilliant and so humble.
661
I mean, it's embarrassing the language.
662
The responsibility that Sam bears is actually, honestly, beyond my comprehension.
663
He's a co-founder of IO.
664
Yeah.
665
Open AI Oregon, 20% of it.
666
No, no, no, 23%.
667
As all Sam Walton deals, have you learned anything?
668
They're conflicted.
669
But the copy here, I just want to get the gentleman's comment on.
670
What I see you worrying about are other people or about customers, about society, about culture.
671
And to me, that tells me everything I want to do.
672
I'm surprised that you guys are such haters on this.
673
I'm excited to see what this thing is.
674
Here we go.
675
Oh, I am, but I just thought this was like a lot of people.
676
Johnny is the deepest thinker.
677
I don't know why we're taking around.
678
I don't know why we're even doing this.
679
I want them, but they're going to be able to do that.
680
I watched the nine minutes.
681
I watched the nine-minute video.
682
I wanted my nine minutes back.
683
Nothing happened.
684
I want the device.
685
They say they have a device.
686
Okay, I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt.
687
They've invented something that they say is world-changing.
688
Okay.
689
But this is, again, I'm just using their words.
690
And he's sipping a macchiato there.
691
So that's important.
692
Oh, my God.
693
You are so falling for this.
694
This decio video.
695
This is your problem.
696
Jamal.
697
Look at his glasses.
698
I think the clue is in the video.
699
Look at Johnny Ives.
700
The fact that we're even talking about this glasses.
701
Let me tell you my 2007 Apple iPhone moment.
702
Steve announced the iPhone.
703
I got one of the, I don't know, in the first like few hundred, few thousand.
704
I was going to Vegas, so I got it on a Friday and I had it in my hand.
705
The way.
706
People liked what you were feeling was love and admiration.
707
All I had was music.
708
There was no multiple screens.
709
You couldn't do it.
710
There were no app stores.
711
Yeah.
712
But it was so mesmerizing.
713
And my point is: you're right.
714
I may have fallen for it, which may seem crazy.
715
But when I saw that video, I thought, hey, hold on.
716
All I'm saying is, if there is a next-generation device that they or somebody else, my only comment is, I think Google is so wonderful.
717
I love the people there.
718
I just want them to be on the forward foot, and I just don't want them to be reacting for the next five years.
719
That's all I'm saying.
720
Here's what Sam said about Johnny Ive.
721
Johnny is the deepest thinker of anyone I've ever met.
722
I mean, this was a story.
723
I'm not just saying what they said about Johnny.
724
Okay, let's handicap him here.
725
I'll tell you exactly what's happening.
726
It's the glasses.
727
He's wearing the glasses in there.
728
They're making smart glasses.
729
Sax, what are they making?
730
What are these two guys up to?
731
You know these guys.
732
You know, both of them for 20 years.
733
Come on now.
734
You know what's going on.
735
Just spell the beans.
736
Let me spell it.
737
Let me express a hot take here, but let me express it in the form of a question because I don't want to be too definitive.
738
Which is, is Johnny Ive just a media creation?
739
I mean, no, seriously.
740
Did Steve Jobs manifest him?
741
Well, I know he did good work at Apple.
742
Okay, don't get me wrong.
743
But the software was done by someone else, right?
744
So he did the beautiful Eddie Q.
745
So, you know, the whole industrial design.
746
Yes, the hardware looks beautiful with a beveled edge.
747
It's a paint of glass with a beveled edge.
748
Okay, great.
749
So just.
750
And taste, and taste 15% smarter.
751
Right.
752
So, I don't know.
753
I mean, maybe he's like parlayed this incredible reputation that he's built in the media into 2% of open AI.
754
Open AI.
755
It's incredible.
756
I mean, what a trade.
757
What a trade.
758
Do you think it was done at that $300 billion price?
759
Or do you think it was done at like a cheaper price?
760
Yes.
761
Yes.
762
Yeah, I mean, there is an argument.
763
I'm going to go into Saxon's corner here.
764
I'm going to go into Conspiracy Corner here.
765
I'm going to say Dieter Rams designed the iPhone, not Johnny Ive.
766
Pull it up, Nick.
767
Well, I'm going to say Tony Fidel designed the iPhone.
768
Okay, but if you don't know who Dieter Rams is, I mean, if you look at the transistor radio made, the iPod, if you pull up the brawn radio, here is the Power Mac.
769
If you look at the iMac, basically, what did Steve Jobs...
770
Are you accusing Johnny Ive of ripping off a German industrial designer?
771
Is that the same thing?
772
What I'm saying is immature artists copy immature artists.
773
I am saying 90% of what Apple did was steal Dieter Rams' design.
774
I will die on that hill.
775
90% stone.
776
Johnny Ive is benighted.
777
He's Sir Johnny Ive.
778
He took Dieter Rams's knighthood.
779
That's what he did.
780
Sir John.
781
I mean, Sir John.
782
He did put the handle on an iMac, right?
783
I mean, so you got that.
784
Stop.
785
He did.
786
You can move those iMacs around.
787
So slanderous.
788
Stop.
789
You guys, this is so brutal.
790
So great.
791
Dude, look at this one.
792
Pull this one up, Nick.
793
Everybody knows the iconic iMac.
794
I hate to break your hearts, folks.
795
Totally ripped off from Dieter.
796
It was all inspired by the Germans.
797
Sorry, so you're saying Dieter.
798
These guys took every design that Dieter did in the 60s and 70s, even the 50s, and they photocopied it and they put an Apple logo on it.
799
Stop, stop, stop.
800
Stop.
801
Saxon, am I wrong?
802
Stop.
803
I didn't know about the Dieter Braun angle.
804
I mean, listen, it is what it is.
805
I mean, look, everyone at Apple did amazing work.
806
There's a lot of people who are.
807
I don't understand this.
808
But I'm just saying, like, I don't quite get this design God reputation that's been created a little bit.
809
But I would say that it's certainly a really good idea to parlay that into 2% of the world.
810
By the way, I don't know what that is.
811
Is that what San Francisco looks like?
812
Like, I never thought every time I go to San Francisco, it's so disgusting and it's cloudy and cold.
813
But did they find the one day where the sun was shining in that hellscape?
814
Yeah.
815
There were no homeless people and there was no fentanyl.
816
I don't know what happened.
817
Yuck.
818
On a serious note, what I would say is maybe what this deal indicates is, I mean, obviously, is that OpenAI is going to do something with hardware.
819
Sure.
820
It could be a new kind of phone that is AI first as opposed to the wall of applications.
821
Or maybe it's like some sort of pendant thing that tracks what's going on around you and feeds it into AI so it can give you more context.
822
You know, maybe like in the movie Her, who knows?
823
But it seems like they'll do something with devices and the physical world.
824
So that would be the play, I guess.
825
I guess the question you have to ask is: will it make OpenAI 1% more valuable?
826
If it's a $300 billion company, 2% more valuable.
827
Yes, thank you.
828
Will it make it more than 2% more valuable?
829
I heard an interesting facto yesterday, which is by somebody who was looking at OpenAI equity.
830
All of the rounds before the $300 billion round from SoftBank had essentially a feature where there was like a hard rate of return.
831
100 Enix or something?
832
No, but the ability to put the stock back if they weren't able to do the conversion to a for-profit company, et cetera, et cetera.
833
And in the $300 billion round, apparently it's much cleaner and it's essentially like sub-new coat that is owned.
834
And I thought to myself, like, wow, at those valuations, I would have expected the terms to ratchet up.
835
And instead, it seems like the terms have ratcheted down, which is, I don't know, it's either a commentary on the negotiating prowess of OpenAI and their team, and or the risk management philosophy of SoftBank and the lack thereof.
836
I do think he is a great designer, and he will make it 1 or 2% better.
837
Design matters.
838
So if he makes it, I mean, there's a chance, right, Sachs, that he could make the product 5% or 10% better through design?
839
I don't think it's going to be 1% or 2% better.
840
I think it's going to be either zero or a doubling of the company's value, something like that, right?
841
Like either he develops an iPhone-like, amazing HIIT product for some new consumer device that really could take the company to another level, or probably they do something that kind of doesn't work.
842
So it's more of like a 2% option against a strike of doubling the value of the company.
843
I'm surprised it hasn't leaked because in Sam's update or whatever, he said that the executive team was shown the device.
844
So what is it?
845
It's definitely going to be a pendant or glasses.
846
It's got to be those two foreign factors.
847
He was the investor in Humane.
848
Remember, it was nothing pending from the Apple people.
849
I will take the field against that.
850
What are the odds and how much money do you want to bet?
851
Okay, here we go.
852
So I think it's a pendant, like a wearable.
853
We have to define that.
854
So like Humane.
855
I'll say it's not appended.
856
Okay, glasses.
857
I go, what are you going to give me?
858
You give me odds.
859
I'll give you.
860
Give me odds.
861
Well, we'll just do even money.
862
Let's do even money.
863
I don't know.
864
Whatever you want.
865
However many thousands of dollars you want to bet.
866
Even money.
867
How about you give me two to one, ten dimes?
868
Because you have every option.
869
I have to pick them.
870
No.
871
No.
872
No.
873
That's the pre-confed.
874
This is my reason.
875
You want to get in on that here?
876
All right, let's move on.
877
All right.
878
We covered Trump's trip to the Middle East last week, but our bestie sax was there as well.
879
And you got a couple photos to show, and you met a lot of friends there.
880
Tell us about the experience.
881
Did you go?
882
Oh, but first of all, did you go on Air Force One?
883
That's what everybody wants to know.
884
Or did you go on Air Sachs?
885
I took my own plane.
886
So I know that sounds a little bit like a flex, but were you in formation with Air Force One?
887
Were you like, you know, just right behind it or on your own travel?
888
You were on your own travel schedule.
889
I was doing my own thing.
890
Did you have the option to go on Air Force One?
891
I probably could have if I wanted to, but I actually wanted to get to the region a little bit early because I hadn't been before and I kind of checked it out.
892
And so I was waiting there when the president arrived.
893
Oh, wow.
894
So it was your first time in the region.
895
Yeah.
896
Well, tell us about your impressions.
897
First of all, these countries are, obviously, they're very resource-rich.
898
They've got a lot of capital to deploy.
899
And they're also very interested in diversifying their economies.
900
They're very interested in high-tech.
901
And they want to do things in AI.
902
They've got very significant aspirations there.
903
And so I was over there just to kind of listen to learn and see what they're interested in doing.
904
And I also got to see some of their tech scenes and just other people.
905
Oh, you went to Digital Garage in Riyadh, right?
906
I've been there.
907
Oh, you've been there, okay.
908
Yeah, yeah.
909
No, no, it's they are really pushing entrepreneurship, trying to generate more ideas and teach people how to start companies and co-working spaces, all kinds of incentives in terms of visas to come to Riyadh, to come to UAE, you know, Dubai, Abu Dhabi specifically.
910
So, yeah.
911
I'm curious your impression of the individuals who are leading a lot of these different groups.
912
I was really taken back by how much time they had spent in the West.
913
It seemed like every single person I had met had taken one of these scholarships to go to Oxford, to Harvard, to, you know, Caltech, whatever it was.
914
They all had spent massive amounts of time in the West and then come back to either Saudi or UAE or Oman, et cetera.
915
So maybe you could talk a little bit about the people and their knowledge base, motivation, et cetera.
916
I had the same observation.
917
The elites of all these countries have all been educated in the West, usually in the United States, some in the UK.
918
The leadership tends to be young, visionary, future-oriented, intensely interested in AI, like I was saying, and they want to do big things in AI.
919
The thing that's been in their way is that in October 2023, the Biden administration basically put a blanket on the whole region acquiring semiconductors, GPUs.
920
And it required that every export of a GPU or a server that contains a GPU had to get a specific license from the Commerce Department.
921
And it put a major damper on their efforts to do things like build data centers in the region or to have their own local AI efforts.
922
So they've been kind of in this holding pattern where the Biden administration decided to kind of alienate them.
923
And, you know, it wasn't just AI, there was other things too.
924
Remember, the fist bump.
925
And the Biden administration was very, I'd say, hostile, standoffish, cool to, and even hostile towards these states in the region.
926
And I think from a geopolitical standpoint, it was just stupid because we're in an intense competition, a high-tech competition, a security competition, an economic competition with China.
927
And these states want to be aligned with the U.S.
928
and we are pushing them into China's arms.
929
And if we don't give them the ability to buy the American tech stack, it's not like they're going to sit on their hands and do nothing.
930
They're going to be forced to buy the Chinese tech stack.
931
They're going to participate one way or the other.
932
Right.
933
And China still has some limitations on how many chips it can produce, but they clearly are building their own Chinese tech stack.
934
It's a Huawei plus DeepSeek tech stack.
935
There was actually a story in Malaysia just in the last couple of days where they were talking about building a local data center using the Huawei-Scend GPU plus DeepSeek.
936
And then they walked back that story because I think they're afraid of getting in trouble with the U.S.
937
government.
938
But the point is that if we drive these countries away, if we alienate them, they will end up partnering with China instead of the United States.
939
I don't understand how that's in the United States' interest.
940
Now, as part of this trip, we rolled out a new framework for an AI acceleration partnership with these countries.
941
And there's a few very important terms that I think it's worth going into.
942
So, first of all, the purpose of the framework is to replace the Biden export control to the region with a framework that gives them the ability to buy GPUs and build data centers.
943
But there's a few very important provisions.
944
Number one is there's a matching investment provision.
945
So, for every dollar of investment they make in terms of building out data centers in the region, they have to invest a dollar in the United States and building out our AI infrastructure.
946
So, it's a huge win for the United States in terms of accelerating our own infrastructure build out.
947
So, that's point number one.
948
Number two is, even with respect to the data centers they're going to build in the region, at least 80% of the chips have to be owned and operated by American cloud service providers or American hyperscalers.
949
So, even with respect to the data centers they're building, the vast majority of the compute is going to be run by American companies.
950
And so, I mean, this to me is just a huge problem.
951
Was there critique?
952
Were people critiquing it?
953
Like, you know, this expansion?
954
I guess RoCon has said, like, hey, we should build more data centers here.
955
That was sort of a light critique, maybe, or a misunderstanding.
956
There's two types of critiques.
957
One is the one that Roe was making, and Roe's a friend, but just, you know, I respond to him on X, which is: we are building out data centers in the U.S.
958
We want to do as much as we can.
959
It's the Trump administration's policy towards energy that's making that possible.
960
We're making it easier to spin up new power generation, and we're making it easier to permit.
961
Both those things were virtually impossible during the Biden administration.
962
So we are building more here in the U.S.
963
In addition to that, you've got these countries who are resource-rich and they have their own AI dreams and aspirations.
964
And we can either partner with them or drive them into the arms of China.
965
And the deal we've made is to enable their aspirations while getting them to fund more AI infrastructure in the United States.
966
And even the infrastructure they're building over there, first of all, it's going to be on American tech stack, right?
967
We want it to be NVIDIA and AMD and those types of companies.
968
That improves our balance of trade.
969
It also ensures that these data centers across the world are going to be built on American technology.
970
We want American technology to become the standard.
971
Of course.
972
And if you allow those data centers to be built on Huawei plus DeepSeek, that will become the standard.
973
So I think this is something that people in Silicon Valley intuitively grasp, but people in Washington don't, which is the way that you win these technology battles is you create the largest ecosystem, right?
974
You want to have the most partners.
975
You want to have the biggest app store.
976
You want to have the APIs that want to use the most data.
977
Exactly.
978
So the point is, we want to involve the whole world on our tech stack.
979
I think export controls on China, that makes sense, but we don't want to reduce our market share in the rest of the world.
980
We want them getting hooked on our platforms, making those platforms the standard and getting lock-in before China can catch up to us.
981
Sachs, did Jensen just say that he thought export controls were kind of pointless?
982
Did he just say that recently?
983
Yeah, he's against all export controls.
984
And, you know, where I would split the baby here is that I think that most people in Washington believe that the export controls on China make sense because we simply can't allow our most powerful semiconductors.
985
Now, where I agree with Jensen is that I think we should not place undue restrictions on the rest of the world using the American tech stack because we'll simply concede the market share to China.
986
And so I think he's right with respect to the Middle East.
987
Now, the other concern that you heard a lot is around this, quote, diversion.
988
The idea that somehow the GPUs or somehow the IP, if we allow it to be used in data centers in the Middle East, will somehow find its way to China.
989
And yeah, I mean, the expression on your face, Jake House, shows you.
990
That makes no sense.
991
These guys have unlimited resources.
992
They have unlimited ambition.
993
That's just a naive point of view.
994
They want these for themselves.
995
They understand the power of AI.
996
They don't want to give it to China.
997
They want it for themselves.
998
They make trillions of dollars selling oil and gas.
999
They don't need to smuggle our GPUs.
1000
It doesn't make any sense.
1001
The other thing is that people don't understand.
1002
They're called chips, but really these things are now the size of mainframes.
1003
The NVIDIA data center product, NVL72, is this giant server cabinet.
1004
It's eight feet tall.
1005
It weighs 3,600 pounds.
1006
It's not like diamonds you smuggle in a briefcase, right?
1007
All you have to do is send them across the border.
1008
That's definitely not happening.
1009
No, it's not happening.
1010
All you have to do is send an inspector to the data center to count the servers, and you can see that they're there.
1011
Ridiculous.
1012
So this idea that somehow they're going to get smuggled, it's like this totally fake concern that's been created.
1013
It's almost like a totally fake narrative.
1014
You know, then people say, well, well, they won't physically smuggle the servers, but the IP will somehow be transferred to China.
1015
Look, there's nothing in a data center that China hasn't already seen.
1016
They have at least one of everything.
1017
The issue is that they can't reverse the advanced semiconductors just from the chips, right?
1018
Because it's about the process technology that it takes to create an advanced semiconductor.
1019
There's hundreds, even thousands of steps in that process.
1020
And you can't figure out the recipe just by seeing the end product.
1021
I would like to say that I'm very proud of my bestie.
1022
I got three calls.
1023
I do want to tell you, Sax, you crushed it.
1024
I think you put your best foot for it, and people were really impressed.
1025
But I got calls, I got three calls from the Powers of B.
1026
They were very psyched to meet you and spend time with you, and they thought you were super impressive.
1027
So it was awesome.
1028
Thank you for doing that.
1029
Well, I appreciate that.
1030
Yeah.
1031
It's an incredible region.
1032
I think you're doing like a really patriotic thing.
1033
If you look at that region, like you said, it could tip one way or the other.
1034
They could be involved with the West.
1035
We could be building businesses together.
1036
And if we build businesses together, that's better than them building businesses with China.
1037
Pretty obvious, I think.
1038
Totally.
1039
And this is the thing: I just don't get the opposition in Washington to this.
1040
And I especially don't get how the opponents of this can call themselves China hawks.
1041
Because at the end of the day, this is a tech battle between the U.S.
1042
and China.
1043
And we can have these countries be aligned with us and in our orbit, or we could push them into the arms of the Chinese.
1044
The choice is: do we want these countries to be the piggy bank for American AI or for Chinese AI?
1045
It's like they have an investment level that they can do that dwarfs anybody else in the world with the exception of Norway and the United States.
1046
I mean, they can put a lot of money to work.
1047
And here's the thing: they want to.
1048
It just hit the wire that OpenAI is partnering on a five-gigawatt data center cluster in Abu Dhabi with G42.
1049
Well, hold on, let's just be clear about it.
1050
So the five-gigawatt cluster, or it's more of a campus that's going to support many American hyperscalers and cloud service providers, and they're going to be one of the tenants.
1051
So I think they're saying that they're going to have one gigawatt, there's still four gigawatts to go, that they plan on supporting.
1052
Well, well, the most interesting part of the deal, it said, was that as part of the deal, G42 plans to make a reciprocal dollar-for-dollar investment in AI infrastructure in the U.S.
1053
So, to your point, Sachs, it's like perfect.
1054
Cooperating like this, I think, just makes a ton of sense.
1055
Absolutely.
1056
And this is not dumb money, by the way.
1057
These are very smart people who are investing very strategically with a very crisp group of individuals, like you said, who have been educated in the West.
1058
When people explain to me, oh, yeah, just go to Abu Dhabi and come back with a suitcase full of money.
1059
No, these are folks who want to be on the board of companies.
1060
They want to company build.
1061
They see themselves as owners in business, not just investors.
1062
And they want to do it domestically and abroad.
1063
The amount of investment that they're going to do in the next 30 years is going to dwarf what we see out of universities and retirement.
1064
People understand the scale of what's happening.
1065
This is why I just don't understand the point of the Biden policy of alienating these countries and making them feel uneasy about their place.
1066
Because you don't know who it was that made the decision.
1067
Let's face it, you're confused.
1068
We can have Bernie's.
1069
I actually have a pretty good idea at this point of who is controlling the autopen on AI.
1070
There was a group of very powerful staffers in the Biden administration, about half a dozen people who kind of controlled AI policy.
1071
And the interesting thing is, none of them have ever worked in Silicon Valley.
1072
They're all basically lawyers, and they don't really have a good understanding of the idea of a platform.
1073
And I don't think they realize that by alienating these very resource-rich countries, that they were creating a huge opportunity for China to come in and serve the region.
1074
And this is why I think this, you know, again, what I call AI diplomacy is so important: it boxes out China.
1075
It's good for America.
1076
It's good for our companies.
1077
It's good for our trade balance.
1078
It makes us the standard and it boxes out China.
1079
What's not to like about this?
1080
I really don't get it.
1081
You know, I think they were living in a world where they put people into very rigid buckets.
1082
If you wanted to look at human rights as an issue, which I think is what some people were doing in that administration, I look at the progress that's being made.
1083
And if you go to these societies and you look at what's happening in that region, the pace at which human rights and individual freedoms is growing and the rate at which those societies are moving forward, it's going in the right direction.
1084
So what do we want to do?
1085
Do we want to steer people towards collaboration and working together to build the future?
1086
Or do you want to have it devolve?
1087
I mean, it's such a stupid decision by the Biden administration.
1088
It's perplexing.
1089
Yeah, I really don't get it.
1090
I don't understand what the point of alienating these Gulf states was.
1091
Well, I like Trump's approach there when he said, listen, you're going to make decisions in your own time.
1092
That's what they want to hear.
1093
They want to be respected as they respect us.
1094
Hey, we're going to make decisions in our own time.
1095
What's right for our people.
1096
That's a process that we'll decide.
1097
Now, if you want to collaborate on building a company, a data center, a technology platform, hey, we're here for that.
1098
But you can't tell us how to run our society.
1099
And just like we wouldn't want them to come here and tell us how to run our society, right?
1100
So I agree with what you just said, J.
1101
Cal, and I thought the best part of the president's speech, which the whole thing was excellent, but the best part was when he talked about how the neocons and the interventionists had come into the region and lectured people and come in with this very moralistic point of view and made all these interventions that basically wrecked countries.
1102
And it wasn't the neocons, the interventionists who have led to so much progress in the Middle East and in the Arab world.
1103
It's been the countries themselves whose own leaders have set the path and have had the vision.
1104
That was an incredible speech.
1105
It was incredible.
1106
That was funny.
1107
Yeah, he did a great job.
1108
Incredibly speech.
1109
And that's the message they've wanted to hear for a long time.
1110
And that's the message that moves society forward.
1111
All these other messages just sort of set it back.
1112
And I think I'm super hopeful about the region.
1113
Okay, let's do science corner.
1114
Oh, by the way, I was just checking X here, and it looks like there is an announcement on what the Open AI device is going to be.
1115
Here we go.
1116
Oh, the puck and the little puck?
1117
I saw that puck, but it hasn't been confirmed yet.
1118
Or is it a puck you put on your desk?
1119
Yeah, it's like a puck with a camera and a hole for a microphone.
1120
Oh, that's a pin.
1121
Yeah, that's a pendant.
1122
It's a pendant.
1123
I could have made $10 straight up versus that's a puck.
1124
It fits in the palm of your hand.
1125
It's too small to be a puck.
1126
A puck's like the size you're in.
1127
It looks like your thumb.
1128
Okay, this is AI generated.
1129
It's not actually the device.
1130
They haven't shown the device from Johnny I yet.
1131
Somebody just took what's in the Wall Street Journal report.
1132
They mocked it up.
1133
This is their best guess as to what it might look like.
1134
This is already out.
1135
And by the way, this is going to get you punched in the face.
1136
You show up with a listening device to a party or a meeting, I'm going to knock you out.
1137
This is ridiculous.
1138
And it's got a camera in it, too.
1139
How are you going to do it?
1140
Like this?
1141
Yeah.
1142
Get that puck away from me.
1143
Okay.
1144
Anytime you're anywhere near your record, we'd violate my privacy.
1145
I was literally at dinner the other day.
1146
I kid you not, and somebody came up with one of these things and it was clipped on his thing.
1147
I said, hey, what's the thing on your lapel?
1148
He said, it's an AI recording device.
1149
It summarizes what we're doing.
1150
He goes, oh, do you care?
1151
I said, do you care if I punch you in the face for covertly recording me?
1152
And he said, yes.
1153
I said, well, then turn it off.
1154
I mean, literally.
1155
Let's talk about science.
1156
Let's talk about science.
1157
Well, you raise a good point, J.
1158
Cal, that these new devices.
1159
These new devices require a level of trust that is kind of unprecedented.
1160
I mean, you already had to trust Google and iPhone and so on because they do have a huge level of access to your data.
1161
But the new, let's call them AI-connected devices, I mean, they are surveillance devices.
1162
I mean, their whole point is to listen and see everything that you can hear and see, and then to give that data to AI to do something with.
1163
And, man, you better trust that company completely.
1164
Oh, yeah.
1165
Which company is doing it?
1166
Oh, right.
1167
That company.
1168
Yeah.
1169
The company that had every leader leave because they didn't trust the founder.
1170
Okay.
1171
All right.
1172
Yeah.
1173
Go ahead and wear the puck.
1174
And by the way, with these pucks, I'm going to make one more point, Freeberg.
1175
I'm sorry.
1176
These devices need to have a red flashing diode on them when they're recording.
1177
We need to pass legislation that it does that.
1178
If it's recording, it should have a flashing red light on it.
1179
Let's go to Science Corner because everybody Chamap loves Science Corner.
1180
Freeberg, some breaking news, some innovations in CRISPR, yes?
1181
It's got a lot of press coverage, but there is a baby born named KJ in the research paper that was published, was born with a mutation that was inherited from the mother on a specific gene called CPS1, and the same mutation inherited from the father, which resulted in the fact that this gene has a deficiency in it.
1182
CPS1 produces a protein that's part of the urea cycle, so basically breaking down nitrogen or protein compounds in the blood so that they can be excreted.
1183
And in the absence of this protein, if this protein is not being made in the body, ammonia accumulates in the blood, and that has extraordinarily harmful consequences, including brain damage and ultimately death.
1184
This gene had a G that was mutated into an A on both of the copies of the gene, meant that the protein wasn't being correctly produced.
1185
And as a result, the breakdown of nitrogen and ammonia was not possible.
1186
And so this leads to a very short life for the very, very, very, very few people that have ever had this double mutation that this particular child was unfortunately born with.
1187
So we have technology today, CRISPR gene editing technology.
1188
In fact, CRISPR gene editing technology is what we use to do some of the work we do at Ohalo, the company I run.
1189
And some advanced forms of gene editing technology include what are called base editors, where you can change a single letter on a strand of DNA into another letter.
1190
So in this particular case, changing an A to a G was the goal.
1191
So the physician, Rebecca Ahrens-Nicholas, they developed very quickly a very specific gene editing target to go in and find the letter A and turn it to G in this particular patient's body.
1192
Now, remember, we have the same DNA in all of our cells in our body, but specific cells have specific functions and genes are expressed in only those cells.
1193
So, in this case, it's the liver that makes this CPS1 protein.
1194
And so, they had to get the gene editing into the liver cells to edit the liver cells.
1195
And if they could edit the liver cells, then those liver cells would start to become more functional and you would have a functional protein.
1196
So, they quickly tested dozens of base editors.
1197
These are different proteins that can go in and edit.
1198
They tested different guide RNAs.
1199
These are the guides that tell that editing protein where to go, what part of the DNA to go to, which is trying to get it to this exact same site.
1200
They tested it in petri dishes, then they tested it in mice, men, and monkeys to make sure that the selection that they came up with worked.
1201
They then put it in the child.
1202
And so, basically, by putting it in the blood, it found its way into the liver.
1203
And that's the fortunate benefit here: at the end of the day, you're trying to edit specific cells, and we can get to the liver by putting CRISPR and the guide into the blood.
1204
It made its way to the liver, and they coated the gene editing system with liquid nanoparticles, which helped it get into the cells.
1205
It got absorbed by the liver, it got went into the cells, it found its way to the site on the DNA, converted the A to G, and as a result, those liver cells became functional to make the protein that breaks down the ammonia in the child.
1206
They then did the second dose, able to take the child off some of the medicines and compounds they were giving the child to break down ammonia in the blood.
1207
And they gave it the third dose, and they're monitoring.
1208
So this is the first time that we've seen this kind of custom CRISPR gene editing for a genetic mutation being applied to a patient in vivo in the blood for a specific target for a specific particular treatment.
1209
I just asked Grok how many diseases are because of an A to G point mutation.
1210
And it says it's hard to estimate through the Human Genome Database or ClinVar, but it estimated between 20 and 30,000 conditions are because of an A to G point mutation.
1211
And isn't that incredible?
1212
Yeah, and I'll tell you one other story about this.
1213
I saw a geneticist here at UCSF a couple years ago, and he was telling me about all of these kids that come in and they don't know what's wrong with them.
1214
And he can see on the kid's face, he can see a disease condition.
1215
They have all these weird lab tests, and the kids are dying or they're really deficient in some way.
1216
And they can't afford to do the DNA sequencing because the child is on Medi-Cal or some other sort of like healthcare plan.
1217
And it costs like $5,000 to do the DNA sequencing needed to figure out what genetic mutation this particular child has.
1218
So there aren't easy off-the-shelf targeted tests or lab tests you can run to figure out when people have genetic disease.
1219
And so this is an incredible, like undiscovered set of problems, Jamaica to your point, that there are likely millions of people out there that have some health condition that they've not yet been able to identify because it's a genetic mutation and not everyone can afford.
1220
And so, as we discover more and more genetic mutations, we build targeted tests for identifying that people have them, and hopefully, over time, we can start to build more targeted therapies like this one to go after and make the changes at specific sites to fix the genetic mutations.
1221
Bad ass.
1222
It's incredible.
1223
Okay.
1224
Somebody wake Sachs up.
1225
Sax.
1226
Just so you know, one thing about America is we've got a pretty good advantage in genetic technology today, and China is on its way coming after the U.S.
1227
on this technology front, as well as AI.
1228
You woke him up.
1229
You should peak his interest.
1230
China's coming for Uranus.
1231
And you will see some very good posts recently on people talking about how a lot of technology that's been developed in the United States is being transferred to China, and they are building biotech companies and biotech solutions that take American IP and put them into market.
1232
And this has also had a very big dampening effect on the biotech market.
1233
So, what do you think we should do about that?
1234
It should be in the trade negotiations, some tighter IP controls.
1235
I can tell you, Sachs, that a very large company, I had a conversation with their CEO, and they said this exact thing: which is that the amount of IP that's available for purchase or for licensing, questionable provenance, but how effective and good it is is causing them to figure out how to establish more of a presence to just buy stuff there.
1236
It's kind of like what does that mean?
1237
Meaning that, let's just say you have an RD effort in the United States, you can almost hedge your bets by having an outpost in or near China, let's say Hong Kong, where there's an equivalent project for almost anything that we're working on happening there at the same time.
1238
And it's much murkier, and the laws are sort of unclear, and it's just different enough where you can kind of get to the same place.
1239
So, it's just to say what Freiburg said, which is that the amount of RD that the Chinese are doing is roughly equivalent to the amount of RD that the United States is doing.
1240
Yeah.
1241
And so, as a result, everything that we discover, they discover.
1242
And so, it really is a foot race, and we're kind of neck and neck.
1243
For sure.
1244
This is a perfect time to make sure that we have an electricity deficit.
1245
Perfect time.
1246
Well, I agree with you.
1247
We need to build out power.
1248
I think the administration is committed to doing that.
1249
Drill, baby, drill.
1250
I'm not questioning Trump's desire.
1251
I'm talking about the actual congressional bill details.
1252
I saw yesterday the Tennessee Valley Authority filed the first ever application for a small modular reactor.
1253
Let's go.
1254
Hopefully, it gets approved very quickly.
1255
This is, by the way, I will watch this.
1256
I think others should watch this to see how quickly they're able to get through the regulatory process to get that thing approved.
1257
And that will be a very good indicator.
1258
If it gets approved and they can get fast permitting, fast deployment, that would be an incredible insight on how quickly the U.S.
1259
will be able to scale power production for AI over under 2032.
1260
What is it?
1261
Actually, let's do a polymarket.
1262
Great.
1263
Let's do a polymarket.
1264
And you should create a special Trump designation, like a speedrun designation when something's super important.
1265
He puts the speed run designation on it, and they actually attempt to do it as fast as possible.
1266
I don't know if you guys watched my interview with Bergen, but he said that there's a permit for a copper mine that's been outstanding for 30 years.
1267
They've been trying to do the permitting process, 30 years to get this copper mines started to run.
1268
And now he and the team are trying to fast-track this thing.
1269
But 30 years, it's been sitting for a percentage of the business.
1270
Here's the good news: that the vanilla folder has made its way down the elevator, so it's down there in the sub-basement ready to be chipped.
1271
But let's go ahead and get rid of Doge.
1272
Let's get rid of Doge and keep things going up, right?
1273
Let me ask Freeberg.
1274
Well, I don't want to get rid of Doge, but let me ask Freeberg a question.
1275
No, I'm joking.
1276
I'm like, yeah.
1277
I know.
1278
Given the amazing advances that you see coming with CRISPR, biotech, but also AI, robotics, what are the odds that we can grow our way out of this fiscal problem?
1279
Yeah.
1280
Yeah.
1281
I do, I'll be honest.
1282
I think the limiting fact.
1283
So the CRISPR side is going to have profound effects in longevity, human health, and food abundance.
1284
So those are, I think about abundance in four ways.
1285
One is abundance of food or calories.
1286
One is in abundance of labor through automation.
1287
One is in abundance of lifespan or longevity.
1288
And one is in abundance of what I think is the most important and gating factor, which is energy, which leads to everything else.
1289
So you can't have the labor savings without the energy and the productivity improvements without the energy.
1290
So the thing I do watch the most, Sax, and that I do think you and I have talked about this, that I do think is the critical linchpin for all of those other points of abundance being unleashed is the energy equation.
1291
And this is where I look very clearly and plainly at what China's doing versus where we're at today.
1292
We've got stated intentions, but the actions are where we're still, you know, we got to start showing up.
1293
That's it.
1294
But let's assume that we have enough power.
1295
I mean, my point's really about.
1296
Yeah, if we have enough power, the 38 trillion of debt doesn't matter.
1297
Really?
1298
You're saying that in a very, very serious way.
1299
That's a pretty important conclusion, because if that's true and we can grow our way out of this problem, then that's an alternative to having this austerity approach where there's no for which there's no political sax.
1300
Listen, if I saw us adding a terawatt of electricity production capacity per year in the U.S., I would shut the fuck up about the debt.
1301
I wouldn't care.
1302
Terawatt, we're talking about gigawatts.
1303
Yeah, I'm talking about one terawatt.
1304
No, I know, but I'm saying like China, you guys know China right now is dealing in gigawatts.
1305
Yeah.
1306
I know.
1307
And China's dealing with a terawatt.
1308
And China is dealing in terawatts.
1309
China is moving.
1310
I mean, we've been through the numbers, but they're adding an entire United States every 18 months.
1311
Every 18 months, yeah.
1312
So every 18 months, China adds all of the power production capacity of the entire United States additional to their grid.
1313
Mostly in nuclear and solar.
1314
Solar is a big component.
1315
Hydro.
1316
Hydro issues.
1317
I mean, look at the number of times they're adding like hundreds of gigawatts just on the Yangtze.
1318
Yeah, look at the number of times that Elon has said this.
1319
Like, it's like the amount of energy that's available, if we just harness it from the sun and redirect it with some storage, would solve all of our problems.
1320
But the problem is that we're at like just a little over a terawatt.
1321
We're inching along in gigawatts, whereas China is in the terawatts adding terawatts.
1322
Yeah, they're in the same number.
1323
They're at three terawatts.
1324
They're nearly a corner of Arizona or Utah.
1325
They're in three donor eight, and we're at one dona two.
1326
Yeah, I've shown this many times before on this show.
1327
It's crazy.
1328
This is total production over a year.
1329
So this is terawatt hours.
1330
And this shows 4,000 terawatt hours is where the U.S.
1331
is at.
1332
If you break that down on basis, you measure it in watts.
1333
So the number of watts that the U.S.
1334
can make in any given point in time or is making any given point in time is one terawatt, one trillion watts.
1335
Meanwhile, right now, China is making three terawatts, and they're scaling up to make eight.
1336
We are at one, going to two over the next 15 years.
1337
So you consider this graph to be more important than the budget deficit graph.
1338
I do.
1339
And I'll tell you why.
1340
I've got another chart.
1341
I can pull it up for next time.
1342
So now, do you think it's esoteric, Sachs, to add these line items at this market?
1343
Well, I just don't.
1344
I mean, you're talking about.
1345
I'm not sure.
1346
You're going to have to provide a lot more information about what exactly is.
1347
No, but I mean, look, Sachs, it's obvious.
1348
It's obviously Bitfield and Blackstone built.
1349
And I just want to translate this.
1350
It's so obvious that automation.
1351
You're reporting on that, Jamatha.
1352
I just haven't seen anything.
1353
It just happened last night.
1354
This is the point.
1355
I'll just say one thing because I think it's, I just want to add it at the end.
1356
Sure.
1357
Automation, which is unlocked by AI, we are going to see an explosion of robots.
1358
They're not going to all be humanoid robots, but like robotics allows humans to get an incredible amount of work done.
1359
Imagine having the cost to build a giant building go down by 50x.
1360
That's what this unleashes, is all of this automation.
1361
We'll have to have Optimus doing it.
1362
Yes.
1363
We'll have Optimus, but we'll have these robotic devices doing it.
1364
You can see it in China.
1365
Go look at how they build bridges.
1366
It takes like three days to build a multi-mile bridge in China because the whole thing is automated.
1367
They do automated drilling.
1368
They do automated mining.
1369
They do automated building.
1370
All of that shit.
1371
If we unleash that capacity in the United States, we can build things that are economically productive for America.
1372
All of this gets unleashed.
1373
The technology is here today.
1374
The only thing that's missing is the power.
1375
David, I would just then ask folks: go talk to like Duke Energy, go talk to Constellation Energy, go talk to the drillers, but they'll all tell you the same thing.
1376
If you want a nat gas turbine, we have to wait until 2030.
1377
Why?
1378
Because China owns them all, they make them all.
1379
So if you say, hey, Jamath, drill, baby, drill and use nat gas, and I say, okay, I'm waiting in line for five years to get a turbine.
1380
So then it's like, okay, what can I do?
1381
Nuclear?
1382
I can't, because that'll take till 2035.
1383
So then I'm like, okay, I'll go into the tax equity markets and I'll finance myself residential or industrial solar.
1384
And when that goes away, there is no energy.
1385
Somebody should just go and figure this out.
1386
By the way, this is our Manhattan project.
1387
There was a Manhattan project, then there was the Apollo project.
1388
This generation's Manhattan and Apollo project is energy production scaling in the United States.
1389
That's it.
1390
All the other shit flows.
1391
We don't need the government to do AI.
1392
We don't need the government to do automation.
1393
Climate marketing.
1394
Let's do all that.
1395
Let us do the energy.
1396
We need to figure out how to get energy.
1397
And you can't decapitate the markets that finances it.
1398
We're all willing to put up the risk capital.
1399
That's the crazy part.
1400
We don't even need the government.
1401
I don't know any of the details of what Jamath's talking about, but I mean, generally, okay.
1402
And your chairman, ductator, Jama Paihapatia, Sultan of Science.
1403
Ductator?
1404
Yeah.
1405
Chairman Ductator.
1406
Who'd you ductator?
1407
Who your chairman, dictator, Jamath?
1408
I'm trying to close the show for the seventh time.
1409
Your chairman, dictator, Jamath Paihapatia, your czar, David Sachs, Sultan of Science.
1410
I am the world's greatest moderator.
1411
I'll be in Singapore next week.
1412
If anything's popping off, Jason at allin.com.
1413
Hit me up.
1414
Why do you broadcast your location?
1415
I don't understand.
1416
What are you doing?
1417
Because I'm in Singapore.
1418
I'm doing a bunch of public events.
1419
People know that.
1420
You're the same one that wants to like, and then you're just telling people.com as your email.
1421
That's Jason and Olinger.
1422
How are we reaching?
1423
Wait, wait, wait.
1424
But what?
1425
Don't broadcast that out, bro.
1426
Come on.
1427
Just email me.
1428
Jason at allin.com.
1429
You know, what do you say?
1430
Why are you on that domain?
1431
That's your domain?
1432
This is what the moment is.
1433
That's not your domain.
1434
That launch the show.
1435
This is all great for you.
1436
You get it on behalf of the show to you, grateful pricks.
1437
How do you use negotiation?
1438
Oh, my God.
1439
I can't even.
1440
It's not in the contract that you get the email.
1441
Jason at allin.com for life.
1442
I think we should charge you 50K a month for that.
1443
Email for life, executive producer for life, and email for life.
1444
We'll see you all next time.
1445
What are you going to Singapore for?
1446
He's trying to get a lot of money.
1447
$25,000.
1448
What do you need?
1449
No, this is a plug.
1450
This is a plug.
1451
It's a plug.
1452
I'm going to go Singapore.
1453
Look, I'm in Singapore next week.
1454
That's it.
1455
You were in the Middle East last week.
1456
You didn't get $50,000.
1457
Yeah, but I didn't pre-announce it.
1458
You didn't pre-announce it.
1459
You were on CNN.
1460
Did I pay for your business class ticket, Jake Hel, to come to a talk?
1461
Is that what's going on here?
1462
You got a free ticket.
1463
Let's go.
1464
First of all, first of all, let me just tell you.
1465
I speaking gigs are sick figures now, bitch.
1466
I've flown private to Singapore.
1467
Never again.
1468
That is the dumbest thing.
1469
Fly Singapore Airlines.
1470
The best.
1471
The best.
1472
Are you doing Singapore first, Jake Hal?
1473
I think, yeah, I don't know.
1474
I think we're United, actually.
1475
Do not fly United.
1476
Do not fly United to Singapore.
1477
Oh, really?
1478
Okay.
1479
Switch it on.
1480
Fly Singapore.
1481
What do you think?
1482
Raffles?
1483
You like Raffles?
1484
Raffles is the best.
1485
That's what I keep hearing.
1486
Oh, the best.
1487
I'm going to have to.
1488
The best.
1489
The best.
1490
The best.
1491
This is beautiful.
1492
All right, everybody.
1493
We'll see you next time.
1494
Bye-bye.
1495
Love you guys.
1496
Bye-bye.
1497
Let your winners ride.
1498
And it says, We open source it to the fans and they've just gone crazy with it.
1499
Love you, Bestie.
1500
I see queen of Kinwa.
1501
I'm going to let your winners wine.
1502
What your winners ride.
1503
Besties are bad.
1504
That is my dog thinking of it.
1505
I wish you're driving way too fast.
1506
No, no, no.
1507
Oh, man.
1508
My appetiter will meet me up with it.
1509
We should all just get a room and just have one big huge orange because they're all these Christmas signs.
1510
It's like this sexual tension, and we just need to release that outfit.
1511
What your baby be.
1512
What your feet are?
1513
I'm going all in.
