1
Something I speak about frequently on Invest the Best is the idea of life's work.
2
A more fun way to think about it is that I'm looking for maniacs on a mission.
3
This is the basis for our investment firm Positive Sum, and it's the reason why I'm so enthusiastic about our presenting sponsor, RAMP.
4
Not only are the founders, Kareem and Eric, life's work-level founders, certainly maniacs on a mission, they have created a product that is effectively an unlock for founders and finance team to do more of their life's work by streamlining financial operations, saving everyone their most precious resource, time.
5
RAMP has built a command and control system for corporate cards and expense management.
6
You can issue cards, manage approvals, make vendor payments of all kinds, and even automate closing your books all in one place.
7
Speaking from my own experience using RAMP for my business, the product is wildly intuitive, simplistic, and makes life so much easier that you'll feel bad for any company who hasn't yet made the switch.
8
The RAMP team is relentless, and the product continues to evolve to save you time that you would never have dreamed of getting back.
9
To me, there is nothing more interesting than technologies that reduce friction for other entrepreneurs to be able to build the thing that they want to.
10
So much attention has gone to cloud computing, APIs, and other ways of making life easy for founders.
11
What RAMP has done and is doing is build yet another set of tools in this category.

Our guest today is Bill Gurley.
44
Bill was a general partner at Benchmark Capital.
45
He joins me for his sixth time on Invest the Best and his most comprehensive market analysis yet, examining the realities reshaping venture capital.
46
Bill tackles the uncomfortable math underlying today's venture returns with companies staying private for longer.
47
He also walks through why no one, from GPs to LPs to founders, has proper incentives to mark assets accurately, creating a system-wide coordination problem.
48
And we dig into the investment implications of AI as a platform shift ranging from evaluating AI revenue quality to international competitive dynamics.
49
Bill offers a crucial perspective on playing the game both as it exists today and as it may evolve.
50
Please enjoy my conversation with Bill Gurley.
51
So Bill, this marks you retaking the crown as the most frequent Invest the Best guest, greeting our good friend Michael Movison out for the Crown.
52
Welcome back.
53
Well, I can't think of anyone I'd rather be neck and neck with on the entire planet.
54
This is also interesting that this is the first one that you and I have done, just the two of us, since 200019, if you can believe that.
55
So time flies.
56
Since it's just us, I would love to go very broad and start the conversation by just talking about the state of things as you see them.
57
I know this is something you used to do in your benchmark days, give a state of the union markets edition.
58
I would love for you to do that for us as we enter summer of 2025 with everything that you're seeing out there in the world.
59
I'm excited to do it.
60
Yeah, I used to kick off our LP meeting with a state of VC.
61
It's a process and a presentation I'm used to giving.
62
I've been noticing a lot of things recently that are different in the world and maybe permanently different about the venture capital world.
63
And a lot of the talks that I would give were based on what appeared to be inherent cyclicality in the venture business.
64
And that has been upset or kicked over or a little chaotic recently, which we'll get into.
65
I offer two qualifications as we dive into this.
66
The first would be, and Michael would appreciate this, I'm a huge fan of system-level thinking.
67
There's a book out there on how to think in systems that's pretty cool.
68
And all Michael and I's time at the Santa Fe Institute is basically tied to the theory that systems behave differently than their individual components.
69
And seeing across systems, it's not easy.
70
It's a difficult thing to do.
71
But as we dive in, I think a lot of the components of the industry are bouncing into one another.
72
And it's the aggregate effect of all those things that's super interesting.
73
And so you have to step back and look at it from far away.
74
And then I also want to qualify up front that I offer no judgment on any of the participants.
75
There are people and firms taking action that change the state of the field.
76
And I think they're all acting reasonably and in their best interest.
77
The aggregate effect may not be positive for the world, but I'm not ascribing malintent or anything to anybody.
78
And I want to clarify that up front.
79
So if you'll allow me, I'll start to dive in.
80
I want to walk through a handful of market realities as I see them.
81
So in the first part, I don't really want to think too much about analysis, but just highlight a bunch of things that if you're in the VC market, and by the way, I think what we're going to talk about is important to VCs.
82
It's important to founders.
83
It's important to LPs, anyone that touches the ecosystem.
84
This is super high-level stuff.
85
So let me walk through the realities and then you and I can chat back and forth about some of the interpretations.
86
So the first thing I would just bring up, which people have talked about, so I'm just putting it on the table as one of the key variables, not trying to overanalyze it, which is the continued rise of the mega VC fund.
87
When I first started, everything was bespoke.
88
Most of the well-branded funds were focused on early stage.
89
They didn't participate in late stage, and the funds were modest compared to today.
90
Today, many of the branded firms, I think, have moved from maybe 500 million commitment every three or four years to $5 billion, so 10x.
91
And they're participating very actively in what we would call late stage.
92
Although I've always thought late stage was a euphemism for big check.
93
There are people willing to put 300 million in an AI company that's 12 months old.
94
So that's not late stage.
95
It's just big check.
96
There's a whole bunch of firms that have moved up market.
97
And then they've also created different industry-specific funds and things that, all leading to much more capital under management from many of the brands.
98
And then there's a ton of parties that have entered the late stage market with different approaches.
99
And some of those have always been there.
100, Fidelity and Capital Group have always done a deal or two every once in a while.
101
But I think Petrides, CO2, Altimeter, Thrive, who I think is really doing some interesting and differentiated things in the market.
102
They're all super active.
103
And then, oh, yeah, MASA's back.
104
We hadn't heard from him in a few years, but he's back and out there in the market as well.
105
He's an indicator all his own.
106
Yeah, yeah, I agree.
107
So there's a lot more money out there.
108
The second reality that people talk about that's staggering, I think the phrase that's used most where I don't love is zombie unicorn.
109
So if you look at the number of companies that were, I always to think pre-LLM and post-LLM, because it really is of a dividing moment as everyone's gotten excited about this new platform shift.
110
There's somewhere around 1,000.
111
So these are 1,000 private companies that have raised money over $1 billion.
112
And ChatGBD told me it was $1,250.
113
NVCA says $900.
114
Let's just say it's near $1,000.
115
Rough Justice, $1,000, yeah.
116
Yeah.
117
It seems they've raised somewhere between $200 and $300 million each.
118
And so you roll all that up, it's $300 billion.
119
NVCA estimates that it's $3 trillion of assets on the books of the LPs.
120
I did some one-on-one calls with LPs.
121
They've slowly increased their participation in venture from anywhere from 5% to 7% up to 10 to 15%.
122
And then it can be as big as half of their private equity commitment.
123
So VC alongside private equity.
124
Some have private equity a lot bigger, but it's gotten bigger and bigger on their balance sheet.
125
So it's important.
126
There's, I think, a lot of questions about this group of companies.
127
One is what's their correct value?
128
A lot of the marks for their last round was set back in 2021.
129
2021 or something, yeah.
130
Yeah, which is when you had a real market peak that second year of COVID.
131
If you remember, all the tech stocks blew up and Zoom blew up at that moment.
132
And everyone did really well in that window.
133
So there's a question as to what they're worth.
134
The investment world doesn't seem excited about this group of companies, just writ large.
135
They don't have super high growth rates.
136
And I want to talk about why I think that is.
137
The thing that most people may not believe, but I guarantee you is true, no one has an incentive to get the marks right.
138
For those that don't know this world, private investing, both on the PE side and the VC side, is this weird world where the GPs, the people responsible for the investments, report the price to the LPs.
139
They get to pick it.
140
Now there's auditors in the background messing around, and you'll hear frustrated LPs because some firms will be conservative and price them low and some high.
141
So they get mixed signals from different people.
142
Different prices on the same asset from different GPs.
143
Yeah.
144
But the thing people may not realize is the managers of the VC group at the large endowments have no incentive to try and right-size this number.
145
In fact, many of them are bonused on paper marks.
146
So if anything, they have the reverse incentives to get them right.
147
Don't the founders have the incentive to get these things right, though?
148
Isn't it ultimately better for long-term company building that you not operate in some farcical way?
149
It's a great question.
150
I think there's two things that fight against that.
151
One, every founder I know has multiplied their percentage ownership times whatever the highest price their company was ever valued at and thought about that number as their net worth.
152
Right, but who cares?
153, it doesn't mean anything.
154
I say that without judgment.
155
I think it's natural that you would do that, but then taking that number down by 70% or whatever is tough to do.
156
And then the other issue is, quite frankly, the lick preference.
157
And so this is another technicality, so I'll explain it for the listeners.
158
But the amount of money you raise in aggregate, just the raw number becomes your lick preference.
159
And in MA outcomes, the investor can choose to take the lick preference and not convert to common so they can get their money back.
160
And so if a company's raised $300 million and they're worth $2 billion, LickPref doesn't matter that much.
161
If the valuation is now $400 million, then the Lick Pref could take 75% of the company in a sale.
162
And that's a real issue out there for people.
163
If we go back to the list of thousand zombie unicorns, as you drill into that universe, how often do you find companies that are profitable and therefore this problem can just go on forever until they choose to take another mark versus those that are going to die at some point that would require they raise and reset the price?
164
Well, I have to admit, I haven't done a statistically significant survey, which might be interesting for someone to do.
165
And maybe there's someone at a fund of funds or someone at Pitchbook or someone at Carter that might be able to come up with that.
166
I'll tell you, it's a lead-in to what I think happened.
167
So we were in the middle of a very long zero interest rate period, which I think the acronym ZERP is used now for that window.
168
And that was unprecedented in 100 years.
169
The zero interest rates for, what was it, ended up being five, six, seven years, something that?
170
Yeah, a long time.
171
One, it postponed any VC correction, but it just created a ton of money and speculation.
172
And funny aside, I got invited.
173
I've only been to see Mr.
174
Buffett once in my entire life, and it was a group of 20 people, and it was tied to a fundraiser.
175
But we got one question each.
176
And I said to Warren, I said,, your DCF doesn't work if the entry rates are zero.
177
I said, all it does is create a lot of speculation.
178
And he said, you betcha, as you would expect.
179
So that was it.
180
Russia's greatness.
181
But anyway, there was a lot of speculation.
182
That amount of money that I mentioned, 275, anywhere 200 to 300, unprecedented prior to that window that companies would raise that much money.
183
And when they raise that much money, a couple of things happen.
184
I think you end up with too many participants in a single field where you would have had whittling earlier.
185
So that makes market expansion more difficult because there's three to five survivors instead of one or two.
186
When you overfund, you do everything.
187
There's tons of great articles and research about constraints lead to creativity, and you're better off choosing one or two primary product initiatives.
188
But when you have that much money, you do seven.
189
You do them all.
190
You do them all.
191
And I think we had a mini correction in 2022, 23.
192
This was before AI blew up.
193
And most of them ran towards break-even to your exact point.
194
So when you run to break-even, you stop doing those seven things.
195
You go down to the two things.
196
But those seven things and overfunding your sales force, they led to revenue.
197
It's not very sustainable revenue.
198
So when you cut it back and go towards break-even, your growth rate gets hit.
199
It would just be natural.
200
So, yeah, that's what I think led to low growth.
201
I do think what you said is true.
202
Many of them had enough capital to get towards break-even or near it.
203
And you would think that'd be a positive based on all my previous talking about the wonderful nature of traditional company building.
204
Of course, I'm supportive of that.
205
But there is an underlying reality, and they could perhaps exist forever, which I think leads to the zombie tag.
206
What's the so what of it all?
207
So no one has the incentive to take the marks.
208
Isn't it just going to stay this way?
209
What's going to change?
210
Let's come back to that.
211
Let me move on.
212
I want to get these market realities out there.
213
Okay, Greg.
214
And then we'll dive into what's possible.
215
The next one's exits, where these things are going to price in a real way.
216
Yeah.
217
So we got mega funds, zombie unicorns, and then the capital markets.
218
So, reasons that aren't well articulated, well understood, both the IPO and MA markets have stalled over the past couple of years.
219
2021 was pretty good on both fronts, but things have stalled.
220
I think it's really important.
221
If you look at last year, 2024, the NASDAQ was up 30% and the window was closed.
222
That seems to be the general belief of everyone out there.
223
Never in my history of paying attention to the capital markets or being in venture capital, do you have a successful NASDAQ market and a closed window?
224
And no IPOs, yeah.
225
Yeah, it makes no sense.
226
That was what was correlated.
227
And so something else is happening.
228
I believe a part of it I've been very passionate about is the IPO discount that the banks force upon the market, especially the well-known high-branded ones.
229
But other people point to the cost of going public too high.
230
Other people point to the cost of being public too high.
231
And then, of course, we know money's everywhere.
232
So we'll come back to this in the second part.
233
But people don't have to go public, or at least the very successful companies don't have to go public.
234
MA is a bit harder to unpack.
235
Everyone blamed it on Lena Khan, but she's gone.
236
And we didn't have record MA in the first five months of the year.
237
It's likely MAG 7 related.
238
Those seven companies are sitting on an ungodly amount of cash.
239
And in any natural universe, that would lead to massive MA.
240
And I'm sure they would love to use it for that.
241
I think they buy back stock for it because they can't.
242
But Washington's not excited about it.
243
The EU is really not excited about them being active.
244
And it's a stuck situation.
245
People don't want to enter into an MA agreement with a low certainty of close.
246
And even the Wiz deal, which is the big outlier this year, the minute they announced it, they said it would take over a year to close.
247
That's very difficult for a board and a management team to take on.
248
Waiting a year is hard.
249
Do you think we'll see a $1 trillion private company soon?
250
How far is SpaceX from being there already?
251
It's a third of the way there.
252
OpenAI is a third of the way there.
253
Stripes, a tenth of the way there.
254
There's a good handful that if they keep their success trains going, they will get there.
255
I'm trying to make the point about the need to go public.
256
If you can be a trillion-dollar private company,, it seems crazy.
257
We will get to that.
258
And then the last thing that could be hurting MA is the overpricing.
259
We did in 2021, and we continue today to fund the most exciting companies to perfection.
260
And that can have an impact on MA as well.
261
Maybe say one more click about why that can keep happening in your estimation.
262
Is it just because the feedback loop is the first set of things we talked about?
263
I think it was ZERP and pre-LLM.
264
I think post-LLM, the world believes, and I think this is my fifth point or something, but the world believes AI is the biggest platform shift in anyone's lifetime.
265
And so if you believe that.
266
And then the other thing, I go back to when Mobison and I were back at First Boston 30-something years ago, the notions of network effects and compounding effects weren't well understood or recognized or believed.
267
I think that's a wholesale belief, right now.
268
And so, people that have watched Google or Meta go from looking expensive at $12 billion to $3 trillion, they assume something might be that, they can't overpay in their mind, which I think is rational for the independent player.
269
If everyone does it, the market's starting to price it in, but we'll see.
270
The next big thing we're talking about is many LPs, not all LPs, but many LPs have a liquidity problem.
271
And that's a new reality.
272
It's tied to the lack of IPOs and the lack of MA.
273
It's also fairly new and unique.
274
I found this stat in the first quarter of 2025, U.S.
275
colleges and universities issued $12 billion of debt, which was the third highest quarter ever.
276
That's an interesting reality if you're using debt to fund capital commitments because your endowment doesn't have the liquidity it needs to pay out the 3% or 5% or whatever it is that they always had traditionally paid out.
277
And then very recently, you probably saw this, Harvard announced they're in the market selling secondary for a billion.
278
They have a lot of unique things that would make them be out there.
279
But even more interesting, Yale has announced that they're in the market looking to sell $6 billion of private equity.
280
The fact that Yale is the one doing it is super important and super interesting from a historical perspective.
281
I would argue no single institution's had a bigger impact on the strategy of endowment management than Yale.
282
Certainly not.
283
David Swenson is the historic godfather of this model.
284
No doubt.
285
And so Yale, I think they say, had a 13% compounding return over 35 years under David Swenson.
286
He is known for the Yale model.
287
And the Yale model is put a lot more money in illiquid assets than liquid assets.
288
And the reason no one did that originally is there's a lack of transparency.
289
There's a lack of liquidity.
290
They're hard to manage.
291
All this stuff.
292
But he did it and it worked.
293
I would suggest that what we might be seeing is the exact result of everyone copying the Yale model.
294
Howard Marks famously said you make a lot of money when you do something non-consensus and accurate.
295
But what if everyone copies David Swenson?
296
What if everyone goes to 50% illiquid?
297
Will it still work?
298
I think that's a provocative question.
299
But I think that's what happened for sure.
300
And the fact that Yale, which led us into this strategy, is trying to get out, I find super interesting.
301
If you think about these LP liquidity issues, is it the thing that ultimately breaks up this big logjam that you've described?
302
Could be.
303
If I can get past these realities, we're going to.
304
Sorry.
305
Can't help myself.
306
The AI wave came at a really interesting time.
307
This is my fifth point, I think, out of six realities.
308
We were headed to this mini correction.
309
You have to remember, Patrick, people were tightening their belt.
310
These companies were laying people off.
311
They were trying to get to break even.
312
There was worried about them being able to raise money.
313
And I would argue over the past 30 years that I have a window into VC, the corrections were healthy.
314
Every time the VC community got out over its skis, there'd be a correction and things would settle back down.
315
I would watch Morgan and Goldman open offices on San Hill Road and then close offices and go away.
316
And Fortune and Forbes pay attention to Silicon Valley and then go away.
317
And I saw that multiple times.
318
You never had a full correction here because AI came along and everyone got so excited.
319
I'm not saying they shouldn't be excited.
320
If it is the biggest platform shift in our lifetime, then you have to get excited about it.
321
It has implications for the zombie unicorn group and everything else, if that's true.
322
But we've all of a sudden seen a massive amount of interest in investing.
323
The AI companies, what do you think?
324
Their valuations relative to revenue?
325
What 10X, 20X, a normal company?
326
Is that fair?
327
Yeah, something that, or in some cases, more.
328
Right.
329
And despite the fact that the traditional LPs are tapped, they were able to go find money elsewhere.
330
The Middle East is the area where most of that money was coming from.
331
And over the past 12 months, how many times has a friend of yours been in the Middle East?
332
A lot.
333
And they're talking to fundraisers.
334
And so they were able to find the money.
335
The money has come in.
336
And people are out there spending it against this opportunity.
337
It's something no one wants to miss.
338
And it's just an important component of everything that's going on here.
339
The last thing I wanted to talk about, which you already hinted at, is there's a new motion in the late stage market.
340
And I think Josh and the team at Thrive, they're not the only one, but they've been leading the way here.
341
Where you go at companies that were already on the list to go public that the journal was talking about, they're going to go public next year, and you present them with an offer that I don't know if you want to call it too good to refuse, but something of that nature.
342
And founder liquidity encourages employee liquidity, it might encourage angel liquidity, and you basically encourage the company to stay private.
343
We've seen that now a couple times, most recently with Databricks.
344
But Stripe and Patrick and John have gone on different podcasts and talks about at one point it felt they were saying, Yeah, we might go public, but not now.
345
More recently, it sounds what you said, we might never go public.
346
And some of the LPs that I talked to, this is fairly unusual, they've traded in and out of Stripe, and the company's somewhat comfortable with it.
347
And that's very new and unique in our world.
348
I think the ability for those companies to get the capital they need, either primary or for their employees to sell some of their stock or for early investors to sell to later investors, it functions a by appointment public market or something that.
349
Correct, more the old pink sheet trade by appointment thing.
350
Stripe's undoubtedly a great company run by incredible founders.
351
Why take on the additional burden of extra work and scrutiny and data disclosure and show your competitors what you're doing and all this stuff if functionally you have your own captive private market?
352
It seems to make sense for everyone involved, which is why I wonder if it might just keep going.
353
Well, it might.
354
And if LPs can create liquidity by selling some of their Stripe without a problem, then they don't care either.
355
It doesn't even come up against the liquidity problem.
356
We're about to dive into all that.
357
I want to mention one thing that I think is fairly interesting and intuitive once you hear it.
358
But those investors that are encouraging that behavior, I think there's another element that's going on here.
359
If you think about a traditional IPO, the thing I hate maybe more than anything, as you already know, the bank's going to be very deliberate on their allocations.
360
So if a company were going public, let's just say large public investor and private investor firm X puts in for an allocation.
361
What do they tip?
362
They oversubscribe by 100X, hoping, and they may get 1% or 2% of the offering.
363
They're not going to get 30%.
364
And when these firms go to a company Databricks or Stripe or whoever and encourage this round, they can get 30%.
365
So they can get a bigger ownership percentage than they would get through a traditional IPO process.
366
And in fact, they share a lot of these deals.
367
So an oligopic opportunity to hoard the public IPO growth years and take it away from the public markets.
368
So we all know Amazon went public less than a billion dollars and then traded over a trillion.
369
And the public market had access to all those great years of compounding.
370
And if you step in and delay that and get decent ownership you wouldn't get otherwise, maybe those firms are better off than they would have been participating in those companies while they were public.
371
Here's a super important piece that goes on top of that.
372
They then turn around to go to the LP community and say, companies are no longer going public when they used to.
373
If you want exposure to that growth in these important high-tech companies, you have to invest in me.
374
And that resonates.
375
So we've gotten through your market realities.
376
Now I would to poke and prod at all of them.
377
The interesting premise to me is I come up from a place of wanting very healthy capital markets.
378
The U.S.
379
capital markets are an incredible thing to have happened in world history and have driven so much of innovation.
380
So my perspective is good, healthy, functioning capital markets that price risk well.
381
I'm in favor of whatever does that.
382
And I'm curious where you think the system, given these market realities, is most broken from that perspective.
383
And you hope that it changes.
384
I agree with you on the wish.
385
I think that we are way better off if there are more companies.
386
One thing I didn't bring up in the realities that I know and most people know is the number of total public companies in the U.S.
387
is way down from peak.
388
And so there's less companies going public.
389
And I think a big part of that is this IPO process, the brand name banks.
390
I had my friend Jay Ritter rerun the data.
391
They're up 25, 26% underpricing.
392
You add in the 7% fee and you're a 33% cost to capital.
393
I know one CEO that's on file and talking to their bankers and the banker said, we think you should price at X.
394
And the founder said, I can raise a billion tomorrow at 20% above that.
395
To your point, why go public if the private markets are this fluid and liquid and optimized?
396
So I don't know what it would take.
397
I would think deals with a capital raise are just going to get rid of that piece.
398
There's a really interesting post by Hester Pierce.
399
Maybe you can put in the show notes.
400
It's only eight pages long.
401
She's the longest standing commissioner of the SEC.
402
There's only four right now.
403
And she's the one that's been the most crypto-friendly.
404
But this post called a Creative and Cooperative Balancing Act argues that maybe blockchain is the path to fix the IPO market, which is provocative.
405
In what sense to tokenize the private assets and let them trade?
406
Tokenize the security.
407
No one would go back to doing a crypto allocation the way an IPO works.
408
It would immediately be DL-.
409
Right.
410
And, that's how ICOs already work.
411
Yeah, so that's interesting.
412
I'm going to watch it.
413
MA is tough.
414
The regulatory pressure is so high.
415
We had those weird pseudo-acquisitions in the AI space with the license agreement and the hiring of the people, but we haven't seen one in a while.
416
That was a way around it.
417
And look, when you price things so high, you look at some of these AI rounds.
418
I could see it making sense for Apple maybe to be in the market for something a perplexity, but they just raised a $15 billion or whatever.
419
It makes it hard for things to close when the prices are that high.
420
So I don't know on the capital markets.
421
It's funny you mentioned that statement.
422
I think a lot of people say out loud: we have the best functioning capital markets in the world.
423
They're the envy of the entire globe.
424
I'm less convinced personally.
425
What do you think are other interesting pockets?
426
You mentioned the Middle East and how they have been incredibly front-footed about this entire wave of technology, really pushing hard to be majorly involved in the most interesting companies and technologies and infrastructure.
427
Is there other innovation in capital markets that you've seen that interests you?
428
I don't know if you'd call it innovation, but the CO2 had an announcement recently that was different.
429
I haven't talked to Philippe about it.
430
I'm just mentioning what I read.
431
So they used to have a $5 million minimum for a commitment.
432
They're taking it down to $25,000 or something, and they're going to work with an investment bank to place it.
433
It's a similar reflection of the point I made about how they would pitch their LPs, but it's tapping into a capital pool, which people sometimes refer to as dentists and doctors that might not otherwise have access to a manager CO2 bringing more capital to bear.
434
The same thing I hear is happening in the PE world.
435
I think one of the big PE firms is in Washington begging to let 401ks invest in privates, trying to unlock different sources of capital.
436
It's interesting.
437
Someone pushed back on me when I was testing theories and said, oh, but the U.S.
438
institutional LPs are tapped.
439
We'll find capital elsewhere.
440
Look, we're finding it elsewhere.
441
But that's just putting more money in the top.
442
And I couldn't quite think of the best metaphor, but you have a pipe that has input and output, and the output's stuck.
443
I guess the human digestive system might be the best way to think about it.
444
Just eating more food doesn't help with the constipation problem.
445
When you talk to LPs, obviously you don't have to name the specific people.
446
What are they saying to you?
447
Are there things that they're not saying out loud that they're talking about more in private that you think are important?
448
I think there's a heightened awareness of all the market realities that I discussed.
449
And I think in their place, they have to make a decision.
450
Talk about long-term decision-making.
451
If you're working in an endowment, you don't get much time to make a decision, and your feedback cycles are 10 or 15 years, so it's tough.
452
But you have to start thinking about whether these things we're discussing are temporary or permanent.
453
And if they're permanent, you have to change the way you do things.
454
So, as I mentioned, one of the LPs I talked to had moved in and out of Stripe, knows the person to call that is running capital markets basically at the firm and is starting to consider that it could be permanent and thinking about how they need to be positioned for some world that.
455
Apollo came out, I think, maybe today or yesterday with this interesting report that of the firms that have more than $100 million of revenue, 87% now, just by count, are private.
456
Now, obviously, if you did that by market cap, it would be more skewed towards public just because of the huge technology companies, but pretty crazy.
457, even with that minimum of $100 million is a lot of revenue.
458
So, we're just living in a world that is a very private markets-heavy world.
459
Just seems undeniable.
460
Yeah, and maybe I'll change some of the wording around here because I had five analysis points, but I think that's a messier world.
461
The comment you made about the best world would be one with highly functioning capital markets where it's efficient to go public and where things trade in liquid markets and you trade daily and with low transaction costs.
462
I do think that's the better world.
463
If we move to a world where the answer to getting the everyday consumer into high growth tech is to put their endowments, 401ks, IRAs into these venture funds that are charging 2 and 20, I don't think...
464
What was that famous investing book, One Up on Wall Street, Harvey?
465
Yeah, I know that what I'm talking about, yeah.
466
He would have never wanted that world to be the world that emerged, but it looks we might be headed towards that world.
467
I just think there's more obfuscation, less transparency.
468
There will be more fraud.
469
There will be higher transaction costs.
470
It would be the nature of the beast.
471
When we use the example of a Stripe or whatever, that's one company.
472
We might go up to five companies in the example, but we're worried about 1,500 companies, and they can't all do that.
473
They can't all be Stripe.
474
One of the things that you taught me many, many years ago is you have to play the game on the field and also think about where's the game going and play for that future reality as well.
475
But if we take the game on the field approach of this messier, private markets heavy liquidity reality, I'm curious what you think it means a couple of different groups should do, starting with founders,, going all the way down to the entrepreneurs that are driving all this value creation, funded by these capital markets.
476
What is the logical thing for them to do given the reality, especially in the AI world?
477
If they can raise at 15 billion, maybe they should.
478
So I'm curious how you would advise them as a group to respect this game on the field and do the optimal thing for their own success.
479
They are forced to play the game on the field.
480
And this is, I think, the worst part of this whole world.
481
So, there's a word that I found called a gavage tube.
482
Do what a gavage tube is?
483
I do not.
484
So, a gavage tube is what the French use to force feed the geese so that they can create.
485
Here's a picture of one, which is the funnel into the mouth.
486
And what ends up happening in this world, because it's the same thing that happened in 2021, is the minute there's a company that has any amount of excitement about it whatsoever, someone's knocking on the door trying to give them $100, $200, $300 million.
487
I think for founders that have struggled their whole life to raise money, this must sound the most ridiculous comment ever, but it's a reality.
488
And I think it.
489, this is a reality.
490
And what that does is it forces everyone to go all or nothing swing for the fences.
491
And I lived it in the Uber Lyft situation, but we're going to have that type of capital battle in every category under the sun.
492
And you mentioned the notion of traditional company building.
493
Traditional company building isn't spend $100 or $150 million a year in cash burn, but all the big AI companies are doing that, maybe more.
494
I think OpenAI said you're going to bid $7 billion in a year.
495
That's not your grandfather's startup business or your grandfather's venture capital.
496
That's a radically different world.
497
And if you're a founder, you'd to think the advice is, well, ignore all that and build your company the way you want to build it.
498
But if your competitor raises $300 million and it's going to 10x the size of their sales force or 50x it, you will be dead before it.
499
You won't be around.
500
So you are forced to play the game on the field.
501
I guess the good news is because these investors are so eager to throw money at you, you can probably take founder liquidity.
502
I think that's bad for the company's potential long-term success.
503
But because it fits with their strategy, they're all encouraging it.
504
And so I guess there'd be no reason not to.
505
If someone's going to pay 30x revenue and force you to play a game that you're not comfortable playing by burning hundreds of millions a year, you should probably take a little off the table.
506
I think it's bad for the ecosystem that we are going to remove all the small and middle outcomes and just play Grand Slam home run ball all day long.
507
But if that's what it feels to me, and it feels we didn't learn anything from the Zerp days, all of the problems we talked about that created the zombie unicorns, we're just rerunning that.
508
That's maybe part of not living through a correction, but we're funding these AI companies the exact way we funded those companies.
509
I'd love to play with one piece of this that I think is really important before I get back to asking the game in the field question for GPs and LPs, which is really just to get your take on AI as a new general purpose enabling technology, because that is the key difference between now and 2021.
510
Just we've never seen rounds this, we've also never seen revenue ramps this in companies.
511
I know you're me because you love technology.
512
I use this stuff all day, every day.
513
It's the most amazing technology I've ever encountered.
514
So, I would love you to just riff on the I'll call it the bold case in all of this, where no one's acting that irrationally because we really do get 5% GDP growth or whatever crazy numbers because this just is a different class of technology, even versus, say, the internet, which was probably the last one this big.
515
First of all, I agree with you.
516
I would never take the opposite side of the argument that it's not a legitimate platform shift.
517
And if it's a platform shift, as were mobile or the internet or the PC, that's big enough.
518
It doesn't have to be better than those.
519
Yeah.
520
It could just be another one.
521
So it's certainly one of those and might be bigger, which leads to everything that we've talked about.
522
And as I started, I offer no judgment on any of the individual players.
523
I think it is what it is.
524
There is some chance in my brain, and I haven't fully thought through all the implications of this, that some of the revenue growth is resale of compute.
525
Many of the players in the market are reselling a wrapper on top of a foundation model, on top of a hosting service.
526
And many of them, I think, people believe are at negative gross margin.
527
So you might, in buying something from a wrapper company, be getting compute cheaper than you would have gotten it from the model companies, getting it cheaper from the hosting company.
528
And that revenue is being counted three or four times with negative gross margin until we get to a point where unit economics matter and they can't matter in an all-out war market that the Gavage Tube funding creates.
529
You have to go for market share.
530
You have to.
531
I think that window is in front of us in terms of how that settles out.
532
But I have no doubt, even if you want to step away from the foundational models the work that Brett Taylor is doing at Sierra, I have no doubt that's real and will impact every one of those companies that he touches or they touch and will change those companies materially.
533
I just don't have any doubt of that whatsoever.
534
I guess that's a long answer of saying I think many of these things are a rational reaction to what's happening.
535
What about this class of technology?
536
You've lived through and invested through lots of these technology paradigm shifts.
537
What about this one gets you the most excited, especially relative to the other ones that you've lived through?
538
My answer to that question is decidedly personal, and it relates to what you just said.
539
I'm probably doing 40 or 50 searches a day on AI platforms, which is more than I ever did Google searches.
540
It's almost all a form of very quick learning, super quick learning about either particulars I forgot, things I don't know about, and it's everyday.
541
And I think to myself, for those people that are inherently self-learners, the speed at which they'll be able to get things accomplished and move up the ladder is breathtaking.
542
And then I think outside of LLMs, from Tesla, FSD, to other types of problems that are being solved with traditional AI, those are super interesting to me as well.
543
Maybe more profound.
544
I do worry that LLMs have a limitation.
545
It's potentially solvable, but they were created around language.
546
They're not great with numbers.
547
And when people say, oh, the generalized AI is just going to replace all compute, I don't see that.
548
They're going to have to fix some things or merge it.
549
The way when you ask an AI, math now it goes off and writes Python.
550
You're going to have to do more of that type of work to get to that place.
551
If you're espousing the, but isn't it real argument?
552
I can't push back on that.
553
Let's jump one more degree ahead to the GPs.
554
Again, the same question about this is the game on the field.
555
What's the rational approach?
556
Two versions of this question.
557
One is the SPOC answer and one's the Kirk answer.
558
The SPOC answer is just, yeah, this is what's available.
559
I want to build a platform.
560
I'm building my own company and I want to do the rational thing to build the biggest company as an investor.
561
And the Kirk would be: if you were to restart a venture firm today, how you would approach it?
562
Would you have a small fund you had at Benchmark?
563
Would you have a more go-anywhere fund with different fees so that you can play the game on the field?
564
I'm curious for both perspectives on the GP side.
565
As I answer it, I want to highlight one of two last things I wanted to get on the table.
566
And that is that time is a massive problem.
567
We're moving the time to liquidity of these companies from five to seven years to 10 to 15 years.
568
I don't know the exact number.
569
And I think every LP is aware of that.
570
I think I forwarded you this NVCA graph.
571
And in there, it has the percentage of committed funds that's paid back in the five to 10-year window of a venture fund.
572
And it used to average 20%.
573
It's been as high as 30%.
574
And it got down to five last year, and it's in the five to seven range, which hints at the big LP liquidity problem.
575
But it's a problem for GPs, too.
576
The reason time is such a massive problem is you have the cost of capital, the IRR, that just eats away.
577
And everyone loved to say, oh, it's not IRR, it's DPI.
578
But if time doubles, it is IRR.
579
That's what really matters.
580
And in addition to that time, the cost of capital, you have dilution.
581
So every one of these zombie unicorns is diluting 3, 4, 5, 6% a year on equity issuance to the employee base.
582
And when you combine those two, it's a real problem.
583
Let's say you were expecting to get $100 back from an investment in year 10 and you want to delay it to year 15.
584
If you just take that 10% compounding, it now needs to be worth $160 in year 15.
585
If you make the argument that these people invested in venture to get a big return, then your cost of capital is not 5%.
586
That's the risk-free rate.
587
It's 15.
588
And then it's 20% a year, 15 plus to 5% from the equity dilution.
589
And now, if you wait five more years, guess how much money you need instead of $100?
590
$250 for a five-year delay just to meet the same return expectation people had of the asset class.
591
So that's a real problem.
592
It's also not clear to me.
593
I think there were a certain number of companies that were either acquired or went public in a stage.
594
And then entropy exists.
595
All companies have trouble growing over the very long term.
596
And once again, I think you're taking that window out.
597
People love to talk about if you take out the big winner, what's the return of the fund?
598
But I haven't asked anyone the question: well, what if you keep the big winner but get rid of everything else?
599
Because that feels where we're headed.
600
That's a long way of saying, I really don't know the answer to your question.
601
I spent my whole career in an early stage and I still love that time period.
602
And I think it's the time window where you can make the biggest bet and have the biggest outcome.
603
I really hate to think about everyone of the next generation of general partners having every company live through what was on the field in the Uber Lyft situation because you go into a board meeting and the other company raises another billion.
604
The thinking that you're forced to do at the table, well, should we go negative gross margin for two more years and take market share?
605
You're not going to find it in a Harvard case study.
606
I'll tell you that.
607
It is a unique set of cards to be playing.
608
And it's super high-stakes poker with strategies that you're not going to read about them in good to great.
609
This isn't how people traditionally ran companies and made them great.
610
All the stuff you read in every Buffett letter will not apply in that world of capital competition.
611
I want to talk about LPs now and the tendency or lack thereof for capital to seek the highest risk-adjusted return in general.
612
It should be the case in a rational sense that over time, the pools of capital would shift around and seek the highest risk-adjusted return.
613
That's the whole point.
614
So, I'm curious what you think the impediments are to that just happening.
615
And it's another way of asking: what should LPs do now?
616
They're the capital owners, or they represent the capital owners.
617
Their job ostensibly is to get the best risk-adjusted returns relative to their own personal needs.
618
What should they do and what might stop them from doing it?
619
Well, this would probably be the last point that I'd love to drive home, and then we can just talk broadly about the situation.
620
But you asked a provocative question at the very beginning of the podcast early on, you said, could the LP liquidity issue be a catalyst of some kind that causes this world to change?
621
And there are a lot of things pressing at that.
622
Time is a problem, as we've already talked about, and they've been putting debt in place.
623
There's broad talk in Washington about endowment taxes, which drive more liquidity requirements for these endowments, and it's something they've never had before.
624
You have the research cuts, not just the aggressive stuff at Harvard, but even the research cuts on the normal NIH and NSF grants.
625
What was that extra part where they cut it from 60 to 10 to overhead or whatever?
626
Even that is going to cause the universities to tell their endowment, instead of 3%, we need 5% or we need 6% a year.
627
So, those things are the things that could push the LPs into a more difficult situation.
628
Yale, maybe being first into the secondary market, looks exciting.
629
You're a small endowment, you've never had access to Sequoia's.
630
You're going to get to buy a slice here through Yale.
631
But if you had a secondary pricing fallout as more and more big players come to the table, that could have a reciprocal effect on all of this stuff.
632
And then I think the other big thing to watch is whether the Middle East might change their mind.
633
I sent you a link that you can put in here from the chief investment director in Qatar and Sheikh Saud Saleem Al-Saba.
634
He said the head of the world's largest sovereign wealth fund said the clock is ticking for private equity and joined the chorus of investors who've grown worried about the industry's valuation practices.
635
That's a different perspective out of the Middle East.
636
And if that were to get infectious and become the universal opinion instead of one of the players' opinions, that would have a big impact out there.
637
So I think that's the area to watch.
638
If I were an LP, what would I do?
639, I certainly think you dabble in the late-stage private market on both sides as a seller and a buyer to see what the motion looks so that you can feel it out.
640
I don't want to create a run on a bank, but you might really reevaluate whether the Yale model works if everyone's doing it.
641
I think it definitely worked when Yale was the only one doing it, but I don't know that it works now.
642
I think it'd be interesting to find a PE firm that was going to very aggressively go through the zombie unicorn group of thousand companies and try and extract value.
643
I would think there's some opportunity there to look at it optimistically instead of pessimistically.
644
I might be interested in that as well.
645
If you were thinking about the strictly returns part of this equation, one of your original partners, Andy Ratcliffe, was very fond of saying you want to be against the crowd and correct to earn the most money.
646
Is part of the answer perhaps looking to invest in private markets away from AI where the pricing and supply-demand story is extremely different?
647
If you just go to a more run-of-the-mill company, the capital markets are not super excited to fund them and they're evaluating them in very strict calculator terms to a degree that's nothing what they're doing in AI.
648
Is that a place to go spend more time?
649
I even think some of the names I've already mentioned that are considered to be these late-stage investors are thinking this way.
650
They're thinking, what if I can find a traditional company that may not understand that AI would enhance it, but where we can go do that ourselves?
651
And maybe that is a disruptive way of looking at things.
652
That non-consensus accurate quadrant, the first time I read it was Howard Marks, who I read everything I can that Howard writes.
653
There is, I think, an incongruence between that point of view and these platform shifts because these platform shifts have now become consensus.
654
You'd have to not invest in AI, which sounds outlandish.
655
So I don't know that you can apply those two things simultaneously.
656
One thing that's super interesting about AI, to your point, and maybe is the big companies seem to have moved very quickly.
657, if you go on ServiceNow's website, it just drips of AI.
658
Microsoft earnings transcript had 67 occurrences of AI.
659
And Satcha just talked for two hours about AI.
660
It's a weird thing.
661
I think a lot of what we read in Crossing the Chasm or The Innovator's Dilemma, the big companies are supposed to be slow to mobile, slow to the internet.
662
That's an opportunity for the startups.
663
This is an interesting one where I think a lot of the big companies have paid attention early.
664
Do you think that that's just happening now, though, in a different form?
665
And maybe the example would be, in theory, Google should have been in the very best position to dominate every AI use case.
666
And yet, basically, no one I know is using Gemini or Google to do CodeGen or to do their just daily driver LLM work or frankly, much of anything else.
667
And they're using startups, Cursor, Anthropic, OpenAI.
668
Even though they are moving fast, the technology companies themselves are just redemonstrating this same phenomenon again.
669
I think there are data points on both sides.
670
I think that's an interesting argument.
671
Apple is an interesting argument.
672
Microsoft, having missed one and survived, puts them in a better position to be alert about the next one.
673
I saw an interesting interview between Friedberg and Sundar where he asked him if he ever read the Innovator's Dilemma, and he admitted not.
674
So when your company's crushing it, those things.
675
Those were for somebody else.
676
But yeah, maybe now he should read it.
677
Evaluating an exciting new AI company where the revenue is of a different nature than maybe Enterprise SaaS was or something.
678
How would you go about assessing the quality of revenue in a new AI startup today as an investor?
679
I think it's tough for the reason I mentioned before.
680
You might be getting a million-dollar deal and it has negative gross margin for you.
681
But on the flip side, you're looking at any AI model that's two generations old sells for one, one hundredth the price per token as today's.
682
And I think you could probably have confidence that you're going to price optimize later.
683
One of the interesting things that partners at Benchmark have been looking at and assessing is when companies move to optimization mode and how they make decisions differently once they do that than when they're in experimentation and sandbox mode.
684
And with the amount of capital you have, you can run sandbox mode longer before you go to optimization mode.
685
And we saw this on the internet.
686
I'd to highlight that the first two years, everyone built on Sun and Oracle.
687
Everyone, all the startups did.
688
And five, six years in, no one did.
689
That's why it's so important to pay attention to that shift.
690
What do you think about the interesting international competitive dynamics in AI, which existed to a lesser extent in some of these other platform shifts where it was mostly the United States, Western technology at the forefront?
691
China is the obvious big question here around DeepSeek and things it, but now also startups coming out of China that are offering what look incredibly impressive products.
692
How do you process the international, especially China versus U.S.
693
component of this race?
694
I think there's a super interesting development in the China situation that will be very, very fascinating to watch.
695
And that is when DeepSeek hit and took off.
696
We were all focused on how the U.S.
697
reacted, the U.S.
698
models, Washington, the fact that AWS hosted DeepSeek or whatever.
699
What happened in China, however, is Alibaba made when open source.
700
Xiaomi has a model out now.
701
I forget the name of it, Mobi, I think maybe.
702
It's open source.
703
And Robin Lee at Baidu had his model proprietary and he said in June it's going to be open source.
704
And so that level of competition, if it leads to four deep-pocketed, all-open products, is going to be ultra-powerful.
705
And we've already learned that these models can train each other and help each other get better.
706
So if you have four open ones that can all train on each other and everybody can get a hold of that, I think that's going to lead to a massive amount of optionality and experimentation that we're not going to have here.
707
That's the most fascinating piece of the international AI narrative that I've seen.
708
How much do you find yourself having allegiances where you want a certain group to win versus other?
709, what are you most rooting for, I guess, in the whole thing?
710
Competition?
711
It's funny you bring that up.
712
I was noticing that some of the people that are the biggest China hawks are the ones that have bet on the new VC-backed military companies.
713
And I just hate that.
714
You might become a warmonger, but I know that that's possible because when I was an investor in Uber, you defended at all costs.
715
That's natural.
716
It's your child.
717
You're looking out for it.
718
And so your allegiance are going to go when your investors are.
719
And I still feel that for any company that's got benchmark attached to it.
720
I don't know that I'll ever not feel that way.
721
So that is what it is.
722
That's, I think, a lot of how this world works.
723
In terms of just the technologies, I think some of the non-LLM stuff is super exciting.
724
I can't wait to see what's possible with robotic intelligence.
725
I'd love to see us make gains in the healthcare space.
726
I don't think all disease will be gone in 10 years, the AI founders are saying.
727
I think that's a ridiculous thing to say out loud, but it'll be fun to watch it all.
728
As you said, I'm using this stuff every day.
729
The pace of change is the fastest I've ever seen in my entire career.
730
If you miss a week of news, it's a different world a week later.
731
You brought up the defense startup ecosystem.
732
I would extend that to say the physical world hard technology ecosystem, lots of which it's nothing to do with war, mining companies or whatever.
733
How do you think about this category of company that is, they're undoubtedly technology companies.
734
They're often operating in very large markets, but they have a very different capital intensity profile.
735
Typically, they require tons and tons of capital to get to revenue in long periods of time.
736
There's all the nuclear stuff, fusion and fission.
737
How do you think about that private markets technology investing?
738
I know you didn't do a lot of it, which makes me think maybe you don't love it.
739
As a rule of thumb, if I were a professor, I would say you could study it mathematically and it hasn't been a great place for returns.
740
And you could look at, there was a massive amount of venture capital put into solar 15, 20 years ago, and it didn't work.
741
There's one exception to this whole rule, and it's anything Elon Musk touches.
742
So, SpaceX and Tesla are data points, but they're outliers, really, and they're both attached to Elon.
743
So, I think we'll have to see four or five of those from non-Elons to know if it's possible.
744
What I've learned and heard and studied about his execution prowess and his speed that he develops inside of these companies, I don't know that others can handle that or are capable of it.
745
It'd be great for the world if they are and they are successful.
746
And by the way, we've seen waves of capital availability lead to more interest in businesses that are less capital efficient.
747
There's a correlation there.
748
So, the other thing to watch is if that got tighter, would the appetite still be there?
749
Many of those businesses involve regulation, and mining gets better if we're not allowed to use China.
750
And so, I hate that part of this world, but I gave a speech on regulatory capture a few years ago, and no one from Silicon Valley was in Washington at the time.
751
And now they're all there, Hill and Valley, everything else.
752
So, that's another element.
753
Maybe it should have been on my reality world.
754
It seems that is just going to happen: that venture-backed, early private markets-backed companies that deal with big regulated industries are just going to get processed.
755
And I'm curious if something Andorol, which maybe is a $30 billion valuation, something that, so not SpaceX level, but big, is another data point in your mind towards, okay, we can execute in companies that require lots of capital.
756
Unquestionably, that's true from a regulatory standpoint.
757
So, I think it had historically been very difficult for companies to break through in these industries solely because of regulation.
758
And prior to Tesla, there was seven motors.
759
There were other attempts at building cars, and none of them worked.
760
And I think a lot of them got stuck along the way from a regulatory standpoint more than anything.
761
So Andrew being cleared by the DOD and actively selling into our military is certainly a new data point and a very impressive one for a startup to have achieved that, no doubt.
762
I don't know that that means every VC under the sun should jump into this stuff.
763
It's hard.
764
If you can make a software company or as people to say, a social network company spring to life and generate revenue growth and high margin, boy, that's a much easier path to riches than what we're talking about now.
765
Are there any other pockets of the ecosystem right now that we haven't talked about that you are especially interested in, company types or investing strategies or dynamics?
766
If I were still an active GP, and I think a few people are doing this, but if I were an active GP, I would be thinking about verticals in AI and thinking about where AI is exceptionally great.
767
It's exceptionally great in language.
768
Coding is a tighter form of language, so it's even better at coding.
769
And there are areas where that matters.
770
A lot of this has played out.
771
It matters in legal.
772
That matters in customer support.
773
But there's probably other pockets that have yet to be fully explored.
774
But that fit is super interesting to me.
775
What do you think, back to our original set of realities that you explored from the LP side and just the capital markets systems level stuff?
776
What do you think is going to happen?
777
You've laid out the realities on the field and the various incentives or lack thereof for change.
778
What do you think is going to happen in the next, let's say, five years across the domain?
779
My gut is that we have a problem.
780
I've always been more of an analyst than an optimist, even though I was a successful inventor, so I had to be somewhat of an optimist.
781
But I started as a security analyst.
782
I'm born with more of a critical thinking hat.
783
So my bias would be that way.
784
And someone could certainly take the other side and say, oh, Gurley's always predicting the next downturn or whatever.
785
But my gut is we have a problem.
786
The system, as it exists today, promotes less liquidity, less traditional high-quality company building, and way higher burn rates.
787
That's just not a great combination from my perspective.
788
And it's all self-reinforcing.
789
So all of the components that I listed, unless something happens at the LP level, I don't see a corrective mechanism.
790
I think we're getting sucked more and more into that loop.
791
There's a great video you may have seen where Josh Coppelman just walks through some simple GP math from his perspective.
792
Yeah, with Jack Altman.
793
Yeah.
794
I saw it.
795
It's what is three minutes long.
796
Maybe we'll put a post in there.
797
But I have a hard time disagreeing with what he did there.
798
Pretty simple math.
799
This isn't in a place where it's going to work from the prices we're paying, the amount of money we're spending, and what you would need to have happen for VC returns to match what they've done historically.
800
It seems a tough situation to puzzle out from my perspective.
801
What happened on the other side of a reset?
802
So, let's just imagine a simulation where we can bring public equity pricing scrutiny or mechanism to every available asset and got a big pricing reset as a result.
803
Then, what?
804
What are the pros and cons of if we have a bad moment that we have to go through?
805
What are the good and bad things that happen on the other side of that reset, do you think?
806
I have a hard time thinking about it.
807
I think most people would consider it awful and having lived through a couple of these resets.
808
I did find this is maybe a bit humorous.
809
I found as an acting GP, I was much calmer and happier and found my job more fulfilling and more efficient and productive in the resets than in the manias.
810
Certain other actors may prefer the manias, maybe someone with a sales DNA that likes to be out there amongst it all.
811
But I just found the conversations about traditional company building and all this, it was all more efficient and authentic in those windows.
812
And the pretenders left town.
813
When the internet bubble burst, there were companies that were consumer were called B2C, and enterprise was a B2B.
814
And there was a joke that that became back to consulting and back to banking because people left Silicon Valley when the money wasn't easy.
815
And the opportunists, I don't love it.
816
I don't think they're in it for the right reasons.
817
And they tend to over-promote, over-raise capital, over-participate in secondaries, and leave situations that can crash and burn.
818
I don't love that.
819
It's a part of the world when you're dealing with it at this speed.
820
So, if it corrected, people would look for opportunities.
821
One of the things that causes this situation is I think everyone has studied history, everyone knows about compounding effects, everyone knows about network effects, everyone's studied cycles, they've seen boom and bust.
822
And you remember how long the stock market was down during the original COVID correction?
823
Three weeks or something?
824
And then people started buying the opposite side.
825
So I suspect that the conviction in AI is high enough that even if we were to have a six-month period where people thought AI was overstated, it would start rebounding very quickly.
826
If you were starting a brand new investment firm today, what do you think would be the most important components of brand building for that firm?
827
We're now in the era where some of the upstart private market firms Thrive and Green Oaks and Andreessen Horowitz and Rivet, and the ones that were started 2010-ish, a few years later, are incredibly big, well-respected brands, and they had their own way of doing that.
828
We're in a new era.
829
What advice would you give to upstart investors that are starting their firm this year and want to be those firms of 12 years from now?
830
It's funny, you just provoke something in my brain that is not the question you ask.
831
That's fine.
832
Another negative element of all the systems issues that we're talking about is the firms that beg their way onto the cap chart by writing a $300 million check or whatever, they differentiate themselves by being the best friend of the founder they possibly can be.
833
This is a lot easier for me to say since I'm not writing checks.
834
And if anyone doesn't what I say, they're never going to compete with me to be a new board member, so it's fine.
835
But they don't take a responsibility of being someone to help you make better decisions.
836
They're never going to tell you no.
837
A grand example of that is the SBF STX situation where no one took a board seat.
838
Everyone believed that he wasn't commingling and it ended poorly.
839
It's helpful to have someone along who will call bullshit when it needs to be done, who will push on unit economics.
840
And one fear I have about this world is there's less and less of that.
841
The very best CEOs, and I put people Barton and Benny Off in there, even Mark Emetta has said this.
842
They believe being public makes them run sharper.
843
And one other negative of these companies staying private forever is they're not getting that feedback.
844
Now, let me try and answer your question.
845
I don't know, man.
846
What would I do?
847
It's a hard time for me to imagine starting on that journey because of everything that I just laid out.
848
So I really don't know.
849
I'm just going to have to take a pass on the answer.
850
Well, I'm glad I sparked the other thought with your question.
851
It was productive one way or the other.
852
Maybe in closing, you could leave people with a few thoughts on for founders specifically.
853
I always try to come back to them because without them doing their thing, basically, none of this matters at all.
854
That's absolutely true.
855
Founders are facing maybe the best setup of all time with more tools to build companies, the most exciting new enabling technology maybe we've ever seen, lots of capital that's willing to fund that journey.
856
Any closing thoughts?
857
You've seen so many founders build some amazing big businesses across your career, backed a lot of them directly.
858
Closing thoughts for them on the opportunity in front of them and how they should think about it?
859
Yeah, if you're lucky enough to be in one of these hot companies and you're in the middle of this whole world that we talked about, I would offer a couple things.
860
One, unit economics will matter one day.
861
And that doesn't mean you have to sharpen the pencil right now.
862 I said, the two generation old models cost one, 100th a token.
863
You can plan that we're going to move to that.
864
It's fine.
865
I think that's fine to have a burn rate, but the unit economics will eventually matter.
866
You'll eventually have to scale the company up and operate in an efficient, productive way.
867
And I think when you have these all-out battles, you can get lost.
868
And I found a lot of founders think about certain elements of operating prowess as red tape.
869
They think, oh, that's what big companies do.
870
That's bureaucratic.
871
That's not why we're here.
872
But as you grow and get over 100 million and get to a billion in revenue, you just can't operate.
873
And this is advice in any cycle, really, but it gets accentuated here because of the amount of capital.
874
One of my favorite pieces that Reid Hoffman ever wrote, he wrote about Uber, this pirate Navy metaphor, where he said, all startups are born as pirates, but they eventually have to become a navy.
875
And that's true.
876
I think it's an uncomfortable transition for some, but you have to figure out a way to do it.
877
Another thing that comes to my mind related to that, there was also a great blog post that I think Ben Horowitz wrote about.
878
He said, We only want to back founders that go all the way.
879
And it was a genius thing to write because that's what founders want to hear.
880
It's true of every venture capitalist in the world because you got a 50-50 shot when you change the CEO.
881
Why would you put that risk on your portfolio?
882
But deep in that blog post, there were two or three paragraphs that says, of course, the founder has to want to learn how to lead.
883
And I think one piece that we miss so much in this industry is there's nothing about a founder in the way they're born that makes them capable of leading a thousand-person organization.
884
And there are people that have studied what it takes to be good at that their whole lives.
885
There's a handful of founders, maybe 30, they got to work with Bill Campbell to help coach them on what it means to do that.
886
But it doesn't come natively.
887
It's not for free.
888
And you have to want to do that.
889
And there's a personality type where that's very hard.
890
I've had great conversations with Michael Dell.
891
He did it for a while, thought he didn't want to do it, ended up finding a way where he could do it and be happy.
892
And it's hard.
893
That part's hard.
894
And then maybe the last thing, well, I'd say two things.
895
One, network effects are real and they can be more real if you focus on them.
896
And I think if you're in a hot market and growths everywhere, it's easy not to think about them.
897
But are there elements of your business where the data exhaust or whatever, where let's just say you have a thousand customers and then you get to 2,000 customers, that 2,000th customer should have a way better experience than the thousandth?
898
And how do you design that into your system?
899
If you do, if you can figure that out and design that in, it'll have powerful long-term implications for the success of your company.
900
What do you think the way to do that is in the AI era?
901
Is that mostly a data question that you just want your product to naturally produce more data that then improves the product?
902
Let's say you're serving a functional vertical.
903
If the learning of an individual customer becomes a learning for the whole group and everyone benefits, that's pretty powerful.
904
And I think that's very doable.
905, there's some AI companies in the legal space.
906
I'm not involved in any of them, but they're studying all the intake information that you would put into a lawsuit, but they're also studying all the precedent and legal case history.
907
And the AI is going to do acts.
908
And if you've got a human in the loop, you're going to notice the failure points and then you're going to improve the model.
909
And those things could lead to someone that has an early lead having an even bigger lead in the long term if there's constant improvement of the model.
910
Do you think that AI reopens consumer as an interesting place to invest?
911
Because it seems it hasn't been since the mobile era when a ton of amazing consumer businesses were built, that we really haven't had a lot of VCs focused on that, capital going to that, and that this might reopen that very lucrative part of the world.
912
There are people that have studied some of the stuff popping in China that hints at this, and I should probably do more work on that and be more knowledgeable than I am.
913
I would also say we had an early shot on goal with character, which traded.
914
But there's two elements of the first wave of LLMs that I think make them not perfect for consumers.
915
One is voice being really good, which they're getting better at.
916
And the second one being memory.
917
And they're starting to get better at that.
918
I think they're doing it outside of the core LLM, but it doesn't matter.
919
And then they put it in the context window as those things improve.
920
A lot of the negative feedback on the early character AI was that they didn't really get to know you.
921
And so the efficiency or the network effect and learning impact and switching costs weren't there.
922
It's not that difficult for me to imagine exactly what played out in her, which was an unbelievable movie for its time, by the way.
923
I think that will happen.
924
I would be shocked if you don't see four or five companies pop up in the next year.
925
