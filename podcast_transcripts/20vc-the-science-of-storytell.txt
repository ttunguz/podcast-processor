1
She says, look, I was there when he came in this world.
2
If he's leaving this world right now, I'm going to be in that room.
3
I did flatline for four and a half minutes.
4
The opposite of love isn't hate, it's fear, right?
5
But you're smarter when you're in that expansive place.
6
Focus is the price of greatness.
7
Did you ever lose focus?
8
Yes.
9
Where?
10
This is 20 VC with me, Harry Stebbings.
11
Now, what an incredible show we have in store for you today.
12
Matt Paulson, founder and CEO at Omaze, joins us in the hot seats today.
13
Now, Matt has the most insane story.
14
This is a man who died for four minutes.
15
I've never had someone die for four minutes in their founding journey on 20 VC.
16
They then built a product that included selling experiences with Cristiano Ronaldo, the Pope and a Lamborghini, Arnold Schwarzenegger and a tank, before pivoting to a model giving away houses and making hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.
17
It is an incredible beast of a business that people don't know about and it's a travesty.
18
The story is incredible.
19
And Matt is one of the most kind, brilliant storytellers in this business.
20
And so doing this show and bringing the Omaze story to life was incredible.
21

Now let's switch gears for the future of mobile and how one company is turning your screen into real returns.
38
We spend nearly half our waking hours glued to our phones, upwards of 50 hours every week.
39
Recently, one company transforming this reality stood out so much I personally became a shareholder, Mode Mobile.
40
Mode Mobile created the earn phone, the smartphone that pays you for daily activities.
41
Instead of big tech profiting billions from our attention, Mode returns over $325 million directly to users through earnings and savings.
42
Mode's revenues surged an incredible 32,481% in three years, recognized by Deloitte as 2023's fastest-growing software company in North America.
43
And here's why I'm excited: Mode's equity offerings have raised over $30 million from 20,000-plus retail investors, one of 2025's standout public raises.
44
And you can now join me as a shareholder with as little as $1,000 at invest.modemobile.com forward slash 20 VC.
45
For a limited time, unlock up to 100% bonus shares and a free earned phone.

47
You have now arrived at your destination.
48
Matt, I am so excited for this, dude.
49
Listen, I think the Omaze story, respectfully, is one of the most untold but incredible stories in startups.
50
So thank you so much for joining me today.
51
Thank you for having me, man.
52
I love the show.
53
Oh, dude, that's very kind.
54
Now, I was talking to some of your investors before, and they told me that the Genesis was a Magic Johnson moment.
55
And so I want to start with Magic Johnson moment to the founding of Amaze.
56
What's the correlation?
57
Yeah, we were at an event that Magic was hosting for the Boys and Girls Club where he was auctioning off the chance to play basketball with him and go to a Lakers game.
58
But it was one of those things that was only available to the high net worth individuals sitting in the room.
59
And me and my buddy were in the room, but not high net worth individuals.
60
We were the guys who get invited last minute to fill the table and come for the free drinks.
61
And so we sat there and watched as the auction went up to 15,000.
62
We were in grad school.
63
We couldn't afford to participate, but Magic was our childhood hero.
64 there's nothing to this day that I would rather do than play basketball with Magic.
65
And so we were driving home,, that makes no sense.
66
Magic has fans around the world, not just in that room.
67
And celebrities weren't really on social media yet, but we're, they're going to be, and they're going to be able to reach their fans in a whole new way.
68
So if we make it so anybody can donate $10 for the chance to win, you could raise so much more money, so much more awareness, open up a whole new donor base.
69
Okay, so we start with that realization: hey, we open it up and everyone can do $10, the crowdfunding-esque style thought.
70
What happens next then?
71
You have that Magic Johnson event.
72
What do you do as your first?
73
How do you launch?
74
So I was still in grad school at the time, and I basically get rid of all my classes and just focus on doing this, figuring out the legal contract, all that.
75
And then we start trying to convince different celebrities to do this.
76
I had been a filmmaker before Omaze, doing cause content, working on storytelling.
77
And you have no subscribers at this point.
78
Zero.
79
So there's no one waiting for us.
80
No one waiting for us.
81
We got nothing.
82
Okay.
83
Our first experience was to be a guest judge on Cupcake Wars.
84
Well, I read about this.
85
That raised $780.
86
$780.
87
Yeah, so it was very innocent.
88
We spent six months on that.
89
Okay, so that brings in $780 and starts the flywheel.
90
What happens to this?
91
The next year, things continue to go not well.
92
The most we raise in any experience is $18,000, and we're almost out of money.
93
Did you raise any money?
94
We had raised a million seed round before we ever launched.
95
We were almost out of cash, and we don't have a case study to show that this model works.
96
And then what happened was we got a deal with Brian Cranston for Breaking Brad.
97
You're a Breaking Bad fan?
98 the show?
99
Yeah, yeah, of course.
100
And so this is the end of Breaking Bad when it was massive.
101
And we think, okay, that's going to be our breakthrough.
102
We're going to do this with him.
103
And then we get a call from the person who runs his charity saying, I'm sorry, but Brian is going to go work with this other company.
104
And we found that out this other company had came along and they had done a campaign with Samuel Jackson and it had raised $180,000.
105
So 10X what we had done, which is, it might as well have been a billion.
106 it just seems so impossible to us.
107
And so she tells us, okay, he's Brian's out.
108
And we're, no,, that's literally, that's it.
109
That's our, that's the company.
110
And I was, he's got it, you got to get us at a meeting with him,.
111
And she's, I'm sorry, but tomorrow he's got a charity event.
112
And then Sunday he's going out of town for a shoot.
113
And we're, okay, well, where's the charity event?
114
And she was friends with us, so she told us where it is.
115
We went to the charity event, snuck in the charity event.
116
We found Brian, walked up to him and said, look, Brian, we're the guys from Omaze, we never met, but we were going to do this campaign together.
117
And then you changed your mind.
118
And he's, look, it's nothing personal, guys, but these guys just seem they're going to raise a lot more for the charity.
119
They promised they could raise $200,000.
120
And I said, well, we'll raise you $250,000.
121
He said, what's the most you've ever raised?
122
I said, $18,000.
123
And he's going to be, what are you talking about?
124
And I said, look,, our whole company depends on this.
125
You remember when you were beginning your career and you knew that you had it inside you?
126
You believed in yourself, but no one else did.
127
And you would fight away?
128
I was, we will find a way to make this work.
129
We will do everything we can.
130
And so then over the next couple of days, he finally agrees to do it.
131
And then that campaign raised 300,000.
132
And then he introduced us to Aaron Paul.
133
And we did a thing around the finale of Breaking Bad, where you got to ride into Winnebago with them.
134
You got to cook meth.
135
You got to cook eggs and hazmat suits and watch the very last episode of Breaking Bad with those two, the rest of the cast.
136
Warren Buffett was randomly there.
137
Fuck, I'll pay for this.
138
And that one raised 1.7 million.
139
Whoa, whoa.
140
And they've done it at auction and they had done 40,000 at auction.
141
So it proved the model, and but just pause.
142
We went from 18K to 300K.
143
And so just take me to that chasm where you get Brian and then you put it on Instagram at the time, on Twitter.
144, how do you make that jump from 18 to 300?
145
Storytelling content.
146
We did a Reddit AMA with him where we seeded the opportunity in the Reddit.
147, back then,, there wasn't even paid advertising on Facebook and Twitter.
148
We got him on Facebook, we got him on Twitter, we started pushing stuff out, and it would just fly.
149
We did a bunch of short viral videos with him, and then with Aaron, we took it to the next level and we got AMC to be part of it, and Netflix to be part of it because they realized it was starting to promote show and became this huge thing.
150
It just spread, and we would do these funny little videos with Aaron, the top 10 reasons you should enter, all this little content that hadn't really been done on social in this way, and it just went crazy.
151
Okay, so sorry, it was a million with Aaron 1.7.
152
1.7.
153
So, we got two between those two events.
154
Yeah.
155
What happens then?
156
Is it, yeah, take me to that?
157
Then we started to take off.
158
We did a thing ride in a tig with Arnold Schwarzenegger and crush things.
159
Then we got all of these people just agree at this point.
160
They're, okay, you've killed it with Brian.
161
You've killed it with Breaking Bad.
162 that.
163
Yeah, the next big thing was Star Wars.
164, Star Wars was about to relaunch Star Wars, The Force Awakens, after it had been dormant for,, 10 years.
165
We did an opportunity where you got to be in Star Wars.
166
And it was huge.
167, we were meeting with Disney and Bob Iger.
168
They didn't know that we were only six people and we didn't really even have the tech stack to support that traffic.
169
But it ended up working out.
170
So yeah, that was.
171
How much did that raise?
172
That raised 4.4 million.
173
Yeah, in 10,, and so when you say these numbers 4.4 and we've got the two from the others, that is subscribers that sign up to a monthly recurring payment for ohmegaids.
174
What did that look?
175
We didn't even have subscribers back then.
176
We didn't do subscribers till we launched houses years later.
177
So this was just individuals putting in 10 million.
178 a raffle ticket.
179
Yes.
180
And so we're super profitable on each of these.
181
Yes, at that point we are.
182
Okay, so we're super profitable there.
183
And so we do 4 million there.
184
What happens then?
185
Are you having investors just throw money at you at this point?
186
We're definitely starting to get inbound investors at that point.
187
And then we from there, it's just years of just doing crazy celebrity stuff, riding a tank with Arnold and crush things to win a Lamborghini where Pope Francis hands you the keys.
188
That was probably the craziest one.
189
Does that raise a lot?
190
It did.
191
I think it raised 3.1 million, something that.
192
What did you think would raise a lot that didn't?
193
We thought being Call of Duty, you got to have a character in Call of Duty would raise a lot.
194
That did not.
195
We thought Ronaldo, get your hair cut and play football with Ronaldo would raise a lot.
196
That did not.
197
Wow.
198
You realize not all followers are created equal.
199
Some were so totally surprising.
200
What do you mean by that?
201
Not all followers created equal.
202
Well, someone Ronaldo has a massive,, at that point, I think he was, he had the most followers on social, but they're not incredibly engaged.
203
Whereas a guy named Sam Hewin, who's on a show called Outlander, which is a a sci-fi romantic show set in Scotland, he's our highest-grossing talent of all time, more than George Clooney or Brad Pitt or Matt Damon, or you name it, because he has this community, mostly of women, who find him very attractive and have this dream of wanting to go on a date with him.
204
And we made it available.
205
And he's really good at storytelling and engaging his community.
206
And so his follower base was a fraction of those others, but got the greatest outcome.
207
I have a similar following.
208
I sympathize with him.
209, we've noticed that.
210
Yeah.
211
Pipe talent.
212
Good.
213
So we keep this rolling and we're just crushing it.
214
Talk to me about then what happens next because there is a massive business model pivot.
215
Which one should we go first?
216
The business model pivot or the accident?
217
They're connected.
218
So we did celebrities for a long time and they were starting to see a little bit of limits on scale of just how many of these you can do and how many people.
219
Were you seeing it wane in terms of, did people keep coming back for the same ones?
220
They did, but the problem is we couldn't give a consistent inventory of similar things because you can only do Star Wars so many times or Game of Thrones so many times a year.
221
And so, and we didn't build a great subscription product to make that work.
222
So we hadn't cracked that.
223
So we were incredible at storytelling and acquisition, but not greater attention at that point.
224
And which part led to the business model change later.
225
But in terms of the thing that really changed it was that I had this personal experience where I had a near-death experience.
226
And then the result of that is what changed my perspective.
227
What was the near-death experience?
228
I hear you were almost dead for four minutes or dead for four minutes.
229
Yeah, I did flatline for four and a half minutes.
230
And yeah, I was on the other,, I had a whole experience of being on the other side.
231
The way it happened was when I was born, my stomach was twisted and not I was supposed to die when I was born.
232
They saved me by this crazy surgery then.
233
And then all these years later, the scar tissue from that surgery fully broke off and created a bowel obstruction.
234
And I didn't know it at the time.
235
I just saw that my stomach was getting bigger each day.
236
I went from three months pregnant to six months pregnant to nine months pregnant.
237
And you're getting really worried.
238
Yeah, my stomach had always hurt.
239
And I was a psycho worker anyway, so I'd always work through whatever ailment.
240
So I would just ignore these things.
241
But then after, I got to a certain point where I called my buddy.
242
I was, hey, it looks I'm nine months pregnant.
243, what's going on?
244
He's, you should go to the hospital.
245
Your appendix might be bursting.
246
I was, I'm throwing a party tonight.
247
I can't go.
248
He's, you should go.
249
So I went and they did all these tests.
250
They couldn't figure out what was going on.
251
And then my parents came and our COO at the time came.
252
And they said, after a while, it's 10 p.m.
253
at this point, they're, all right, you guys go home.
254
We're going to keep Matt.
255
overnight and if he's not better in the morning then we'll figure out some surgery to do then.
256
They start to go home and our the CO, her name is Helen, she drives back to her house and she gets there.
257
It's maybe almost midnight at this point.
258
She's exhausted.
259
She's been in the hospital all day and she's going to get out of her car and something tells her to drive back to the hospital.
260
And Helen is British.
261
She's a COO.
262
She's not a Venice Beach, listen to the cosmos type person.
263, this is very out of character for her.
264
But the voice was undeniable.
265
So she drove back.
266
And if she hadn't driven back, I would have probably died 45 minutes later.
267
Why?
268
Because you were already there.
269
I was there, but my blood pressure had plummeted and the machines had not alerted the nurse.
270
And so she came in and she'd been in the hospital with her grandmother.
271
So she knew how to read them and she saw how low my blood pressure was.
272
So she went and grabbed the nurse.
273
Said, look, this looks really bad.
274
And the nurse was, this can't be right.
275
He wouldn't be getting oxygen to his brain.
276
So they did another test, got the same results.
277
Finally, she's, fuck this.
278, I need to go.
279
Am I allowed to say that on the show?
280
Yeah.
281
I grabbed the doctor.
282
She grabbed the doctor.
283
The doctor came in, took one look, and called in the crash team.
284
They rushed me down to surgery.
285
I came out of surgery and they said to my mom, the good news is we figured out what it is.
286
It's a bowel obstruction.
287
The bad news is he's in critical condition.
288
His heart rate is continuing to plummet and we don't know why.
289
Then a couple hours pass, and my mom goes downstairs to get my dad and my brother, and she's coming back up the elevator, and she hears over the loudspeaker code blue in room 437.
290
And my mom works in a hospital, so she knows that means flatline, and she knows that's my room.
291
So she gets out of the elevator, she runs down the door, she gets to the door of the operating room, and the nurse says, I'm sorry, you can't come in.
292
This is really serious.
293
And she says, Look, I was there when he came in this world.
294
If he's leaving this world right now, I'm going to be in that room.
295
So she lets her in the room, and I'm on a table this one right here, and I'm flatlined.
296
And they're doing the compressions, and they're doing the defibrillators, the,, the electric paddles.
297
My body is bouncing up and down, but I'm not responding.
298
So my mom starts to crumble.
299, it's one thing to lose a child.
300
It's another thing if you're in the room when it's happening.
301
And at the same time, my dad was outside with my brother, and this doctor came out and said to another doctor in front of my brother, not knowing it was my brother, Hey, I think we lost this guy.
302
I think he's gone.
303
And so my brother pushed my dad in the room.
304
My mom's faced this way towards me, and my dad comes from the other side, and he was crying so loud.
305
My mom turned from me to my dad to say,, Gary, you gotta, shut the fuck up, or is it gonna kick us out of this room?
306
And she said, when she did that, she said she saw something that she had never seen before in a hospital.
307
She said that every nurse and every staff member and every doctor had gravitated outside the window, and there was 40 of them.
308
And she said, they look this silent church choir just sending in this positive energy.
309
And she was so moved by these people that were sending in love to her son that they didn't even know that it was this spiritual experience for her.
310
And it was transformative.
311
She just took a deep breath and she turned back and she started coaching me, almost talking shit to me.
312
And she was, Matthew, David Poulson, these people are fighting to save your life, but you're not fighting hard enough.
313
You need to show them you're a fighter.
314
You need to fight to come back to us.
315, they said it was surreal to watch because here's this 65-year-old mom in a room.
316
If you watch Gray's Anatomy, there's never a mom in that room.
317
But because she kept fighting, they kept fighting.
318
They don't usually fight that long.
319
They don't usually let it go for four and a half minutes, but they did because of her.
320
But then at one point, she started to think,, this has gone on too long and I'm going to lose my son.
321, if I lose my son,, my husband's going to die of a broken heart.
322
And right as she went there, the main doctor almost shook his head as if to say,, this is over.
323
And she said, no, please,, don't call.
324
And she grabbed his arm.
325
And they turned back to the table and he said, wait a second.
326
I think we might have a pull.
327
And then all of a sudden, they're all just looking at that machine, that flat line, just looking for it to tick up.
328
Instead of it ticking up, all of a sudden, I just pop up and I look up and there's this whole room of people looking at me with their mouth eyes open, mouth open, because the patient doesn't usually do that.
329
And then all of a sudden, I look over and I see my mom.
330
Do you remember this?
331
Yeah.
332
And you see your mom.
333
I see my mom and then I see my dad.
334
And I was on my side.
335
And I lifted my right arm and gave him a thumbs up.
336
So it's easy.
337
Oh my God.
338
My brother's just had his first baby.
339
And seeing the love that a parent has so viscerally for their child, and I see it in him with his daughter, it really gives me goosebumps thinking of a mother standing there watching in that way.
340
What happens then?
341
You give the thumbs up and then the recovery process starts.
342, no, there was a couple more days of crazy stuff that happened.
343
After that, the doctors rushed down and they have these models to assess probability of survival.
344
And they looked at me and it was well below 1%.
345
And so he turns to my mom to basically say, Hey, I know this just happened, but you got to understand,, this isn't pacing to end well.
346
And she says, I understand.
347
He says, You don't understand.
348
His organs are shutting down.
349
And she said, I understand.
350
But two minutes ago, we didn't have a pulse.
351
And now we have a pulse.
352
So what are we going to do about that?
353
And he says, okay, well, there's this thing called an ECMO machine.
354
It's not a great option, but it's our only option.
355
But only about half the people who touch this machine live to tell a story.
356
But the problem is, we only have one of these things.
357
And then we are at UCLA Santa Monica, and this machine is at UCLA Westwood.
358
And we've never transported it before it's ever been done.
359
The other problem is there's only two doctors who do this surgery and neither of them are on call and it's Father's Day.
360
And then randomly, the guy that I had initially reached out to the doctor happened to be at a bachelor party in Vegas and he was with the head of cardiology at UCLA.
361
And he said, hey, can you check your phone to see how my buddy's doing?
362
I sent him to the hospital with the stomach thing yesterday and they can see the real-time records.
363
So the guy pulls it up and he said, dude, your buddy's going to die any minute.
364
And so they got a hold of the head of UCLA.
365
They got him to sign off and sending this ECMO machine to the patient, first time in the history of the United States, maybe the world.
366
They send this thing to me in a J-Rig duct tape ambulance.
367
They do the surgery, then attach me back, send me back to the hospital.
368
And that's where they ended up saving me.
369
There's so many things where it's, if this hadn't happened, respectfully, yet you wouldn't have been there.
370
Absolutely.
371
It took me a long time to process that.
372
When did you regain consciousness in this process?
373
The first time was when I came back, in that room after they had done the fibrillators and all that, I was conscious again.
374
Then I went back into a coma and then I didn't become conscious again for three or three days after that.
375
How does going through this unbelievable shitstorm of pain, death, life, how does that change one's relationship to fear?
376
Yeah,, it fundamentally changed my relationship to fear.
377
What I realized that I was a lot more fear-driven, fear of what other people thought, fear of not being enough, fear of not being liked or loved.
378
And I used to let that drive a lot of my decision-making.
379
Even what quote-unquote, brave choices I would make were really made out of fear, trying to avoid something happening.
380
And if you really deconstruct what fear is, in most cases, it's very rarely you're running from actual life threat.
381
It's really mostly just a story of some imagined consequences that really only exists in your own brain.
382
And when you realize when you go through something that is that the actual thing is never as bad as the fear of the thing.
383
Death is most people's greatest fear.
384 I experienced some version of that.
385
I was, oh, that wasn't that bad.
386
I've met a lot of people who've been through trauma or lost everything,, lived their greatest fear and then realized, oh, I'm okay.
387 I can bounce back from that.
388
So what that means now is I think fear is still useful.
389
It can be very motivating.
390
And a lot of people lead by fear, and that can work in the short term.
391
If you study the teams or the groups that have done something that is enduring, that is truly world-changing over time, they're also able to make decisions out of a place of love, out of a place of expansion.
392
Because the opposite of love isn't hate, it's fear, right?
393
And that may sound too hippy-dippy for a VC podcast.
394
Oh, I it.
395
But you're smarter when you're in that expansive place, right?
396
You're making decisions from your prefrontal cortex instead of your amygdala.
397
You're taking in more information.
398
You're more creative.
399
What do you mean on the opposite of love isn't hate?
400
It's fear.
401
I've always been brought up to be told that there's love and there's hate.
402
Hate is closer to love than you think, right?
403
We've all experienced some version of that.
404
Love is, you can define love a bunch of different ways, but in its greatest form, it is expansive.
405
It is opening.
406
It makes you take in all sorts of information around you that you might not otherwise.
407
Fear constricts you, makes you focus on things that you think are threatening you, spikes your cortisol levels.
408
Again, can be very motivating, but over time, it makes you make worse decisions.
409
So it's not I stopped feeling the fear, but I think I've just developed techniques to get past it faster.
410
What did you do out of fear that you now no longer do, having been through this experience?
411
Oh, man.
412
How much time do we have?
413
There were some big decisions I made about Omaze that I allowed others to influence me, make me go against my gut because of my fear of being criticized, my fear of the group not liking me, being unpopular, investors not thinking I'm experienced enough.
414 I allowed the noise to come in when I knew the better answer.
415
Which is most seminal, do you think?
416
Which decision?
417
Yeah.
418
I made the decision after I came back from the near-death experience to change from being a business that was focused on celebrities to a business that offered prizes.
419
That may sound obvious now, but that was a huge change for us.
420
How did that realization come about?
421
That is a big shift.
422
We had done a campaign with Daniel Craig where you got to go to New York, you got to ride around in a one-of-a-kind, Aston Martin, and you got to keep the Aston Martin.
423
And it was the first time we'd offered a prize.
424
We thought it would raise $300,000 and it raised $2.1 million.
425
And so then I went to our CFO, Nina, and I said, hey, I think we should offer a car.
426
We should go buy a $250,000 McLaren, offer it with just Omaze, no talent.
427
Because if we could do that on our own, then we would control our own destiny.
428
We would really have something.
429
If we could raise $500,000, let's say.
430
The problem is we only had $900,000 in the bank at that time.
431
So it was a big bet for us.
432
But we took the bet.
433
And then that car coincidentally launched the day before I unexpectedly went into a hospital.
434
Oh, bugger.
435
Yeah.
436
Bad time.
437
Well, yeah, bad, but it turned out to be great because when I came back, I was sitting down with her and I had all this distance and all this perspective and said, by the way, whatever happened with the McLaren, did it raise the $500,000?
438
And she said it raised $1.9 million.
439
And I was, that changes everything.
440
So I went to the board and the team are, we're going all in on this.
441
There was huge resistance.
442
Why was that resistance?
443
This is what we were known for.
444
This was our magic.
445
This is why people came and joined.
446
We were a well-known brand in this space.
447
We were featured on the tonight show.
448
We'd have dedicated HBO special, all this stuff.
449 Omaze was a thing.
450
And you're, you're getting rid of the thing that makes it the thing.
451, what are you after this?
452
For people internally, that was part of their identity that they were doing this cool stuff that everyone would look at and be, you get to do riding a tank with Arnold.
453
That's so cool.
454, giving away an Aston Martin is not as cool.
455
So that's where a lot of it was, where I may have caved that before I did not, in this situation, I was okay with people not liking the decision.
456
Did we move to the subscription model straight away with this transition?
457
No, that didn't come until we'd launched the houses.
458
So, yeah, so basically we did that transition.
459
Then we started, we started doing holidays.
460
That did well.
461
We started doing cars.
462
That did well.
463
And then we said, okay, where this is really at is houses.
464
A car changes someone's lifestyle.
465
A house changes someone's life.
466
We launched that here in the UK because we had a great operator here named James Oaks and smaller country, less expensive houses.
467
And we also had a really good business going.
468
The US business was going really well at that time.
469
When you say really well, what revenues did they?
470
Really well, I guess it's an overstatement for this podcast.
471
For us, it was really well.
472
It was 100 million.
473, it wasn't nothing.
474
Pretty freaking great.
475
Yeah.
476
But we felt that if we made it just about houses and made it a monthly draw, then we could start offering subscriptions and we could still create this sense of life change.
477
We could use our storytelling, but there'd be much more natural retention.
478
And so that was the thesis in launching it here.
479
And then, yeah, it just took us.
480
So we launched it here with this wonderful James Oaks.
481
Yeah.
482
And we're doing houses and we're doing subscription.
483
What happens then?
484
So we do houses first.
485
Subscriptions doesn't come until we get to a house a month.
486
Okay.
487
Because it took us a while to get to that.
488
But eventually.
489
What happens with the first house?
490
The first house was amazing.
491
It was a million pound house in Cheshire.
492
So,, now we do five million pound houses.
493
So it was quite, it was pretty far from what we offer now.
494
But it was great.
495,.
496
You're nervous buying this house.
497
This is a big deal.
498
Yeah, it was a big deal.
499
Yeah.
500
For sure.
501
Yeah.
502
But the first house, right from the beginning, you're, oh, people are into this.
503
And so straight away, you saw the numbers being really positive.
504
Yes, we did.
505
Now, we made that first house go for six months.
506
Right now we do for months because we were nervous about it.
507
But yeah, then we had a big thing.
508
Okay, do we go up for the second house?
509
Do we get a three million pound house?
510, will that work?
511
That was a huge decision.
512
We were both, people went both ways, decided to do it.
513
And then it was, all right, we got to get so we can offer a house every month.
514
But that's expensive, right?
515
You have to buy seven, eight houses out in front in order to do that because you got to, you got to, we renovate them, we design them, we do all that stuff.
516
So and we produce and create all the content.
517
So you have to buy seven houses up front.
518
We have to be seven houses ahead in our purchasing.
519
Fuck.
520
That's a complex process.
521
Yeah, it's hard.
522
You also have to be buying five million pound houses.
523
Yes.
524
And we build them now.
525
So you're spending 35 million on houses.
526
Yes.
527
Wow.
528
But it's very profitable.
529
No, I know.
530
I know it is.
531
Does the value of the house correlate to the acquisition of subscribers?
532 if you have a Â£1 million pound house and a Â£5 million house, do you get 5x more acquired subscribers with the 5 million?
533
Or is it not directly correlated?
534
It's not that cleanly correlated.
535
We've had some of our best houses that have been 3 million pounds and others that were five, not as good.
536
It's really just there's a threshold where you can make something really stand out, where that really catches your attention, whether it's on Instagram or on television.
537
It has certain, we know the features that really matter.
538 we've tested,, we've had over 10 million different performance marketing ads.
539
We see what people click through on.
540
We see what design.
541
We're now building towards those designs.
542
So we know what matters to people.
543
We know what matters in the kitchen.
544
We know what matters in an office.
545
We know some of the things that punch above its weight class.
546
And so we create the houses accordingly.
547
Creating the houses accordingly, it requires storytelling.
548
You're very good at storytelling.
549
And we channeled before, and you said to me, and a lot of people throw around storytelling as this,, oh, it's so important.
550
But there's not really much substance to it when you dig deeper.
551
You said to me before there's a science to storytelling that all businesses need to understand.
552
What do you think that is?
553
Yeah, I think there's a science and then there's a fundamental principle.
554
So the science is really simple, which is that our brain is constantly scanning for information that helps us survive or thrive.
555
And so your brand has to very clearly communicate how you will do that for that customer.
556
That can take many forms, right?
557
Saving money is a form of survival to our brain, saving time, increasing your status so that you can be part of a tribe, whatever it is.
558
But you've got to very clearly communicate that.
559
And if you confuse, you lose.
560
The other thing our brain is doing is constantly trying to conserve calories.
561
So if your message is not super clear, if the brain has to work really hard to figure out why, how you're contributing to that, it will just tune you out.
562
So that's the very basic science of it.
563
And I can talk through the principles of how you do that if it's helpful.
564
Yeah, I'd love to understand the principles before I dig in the.
565
So a lot of this is driven by this guy named Donald Miller who wrote a book called Building a Story Brand.
566
And he deconstructs the seven steps that every story follows.
567
And so we study those.
568
But the main principles that would hopefully be relevant to people who are listening is the first thing is make the customer the hero.
569
So many brands make themselves the hero.
570
What does it mean to make a customer a hero?
571
So here's a good example.
572
You remember Title?
573
Title?
574
Yeah.
575
Yeah.
576
Jay-Z.
577
Jay-Z Spotify competitor.
578
Yeah, exactly.
579
So they had all the celebrities in the world, all the top musicians, Jay-Z, Beyonce, you name it, they were part of this thing.
580
The technology was just as good as Spotify's at the time.
581
And they ended up losing when they should have won because they made all their marketing about Jay-Z and Beyonce are overcoming the music industry.
582
And this is the new thing where they are the hero that is going to conquer.
583
Whereas Spotify is giving you your wrapped and saying, This is what you did this year, Harry.
584
This is what you listened to.
585
And we know this about you.
586
That subtle difference is massive in terms of what a customer sees.
587
So Title, for a customer's perspective, was not participating in their status and their survival and anything that was meaningful to them.
588
It was about they made them the heroes.
589
Your job as a brand is being the guide.
590
And so you've got to communicate with empathy and authority to become a trusted guide.
591
I'm listening to it and I'm thinking, did we completely do the branding for Project Europe wrong?
592
And the reason I say that is because very similar to Tide or Tidal, whatever one it is, I can't remember.
593
That was terrible.
594
It shows how bad it was, bluntly.
595
But we made the seasoned entrepreneur, the microphone, the amplifier, the hero, the one that you look up to.
596
What we didn't do, and what I'm thinking is, and I think the reason the show is successful is because I'm always very open.
597
What we didn't do was go and film an incredible entrepreneur at ETH in a lab, or an incredible entrepreneur in KTH in a dorm room, or an incredible entrepreneur in a town hall in Imperial, and show what everyone once was, which is just that little person starting something with a dream.
598
Exactly.
599
Those entrepreneurs are the heroes.
600
The ones investing in the fund are the guides.
601
And I think you did it the other way around.
602
Fuck.
603
Well,, it's not too late.
604
It's not too late.
605
That's a really interesting one.
606
How important is a launch?
607, it can be huge for a company.
608
Dollar Shave Club is a great example.
609
Insane.
610
But that's storytelling, right?
611
They were the guide.
612
They used empathy, communicate through laughter to show you they're going to guide you in your journey to be more manly.
613
That was huge.
614, our launch was terrible.
615
We did Cupcake Wars.
616
It was raised 780, so you can't survive it.
617
Okay, so the first one is make them the hero.
618
What's the second one?
619
You're the guide, so communicate with empathy and authority.
620
What does that mean?
621
So empathy means show your customer that you see them, right?
622
So by the language that you use, laughter is the best version of this.
623
You can make a customer laugh.
624
Laughter is a neurological shortcut to connection.
625
It's a dopamine release.
626
It brings down your defenses.
627
It builds trust.
628 the Gecko, the Geico Gecko is a great example of that as a guide.
629
They had grown at a 2% Kager for 40 years until they launched the Gecko in 1999.
630
At that point, they had 21% brand awareness.
631
10 years later, they had 90% brand awareness.
632
They went from 4 billion in premiums to 15.6 billion.
633
They doubled their market share because it was a very accessible, funny thing that made auto insurance less intimidating to people.
634
So it was a trusted guide.
635
It was funny.
636
Do you lose authority by being humorous?
637
Not if you do it in the right way.
638
You can,, if you just show a bunch of jackass videos and,,, it might not work.
639
But if you speak to people in the right way, it'll work.
640
That's why,, do you imagine being in the boardroom of Geico when they came in?
641
They're, hey, our new spokesperson is going to be a six-inch lizard, at an auto insurance company.
642
And they just are, are you kidding?
643
But now they all do it.
644
All those,, at least in the US, all the insurance companies do that.
645
Yeah, we have to compare the meercat in the UK.
646
Yeah, exactly.
647
There's two other principles that are key.
648
One is that you need to show the customer how you're going to participate in their transformation.
649
Almost every consumer brand is selling transformation.
650, Nike is saying put on this rubber and leather on your feet and you will transform into an athlete.
651
Gatorade is saying drink the sugar water and you will transform into Michael Jordan.
652
And so you've got to be very clear about that.
653
And then you've got to use the principle of story gaps, right?
654
Every form of entertainment that is interesting is created by a gap in the story.
655
Is the hero going to make it across the bridge?
656
Is the cake and the cooking show going to turn out okay?
657
Am I going to make it to the next level of the game?
658, our whole business is a story gap.
659, people subscribe every month, waiting to see if they're going to transform their life by winning a house.
660
It's that gap keeps them entertained and they stick as a result of that.
661
Does it matter if the conclusion is known?
662
No, it's not, it does matter.
663
It's an odd gap.
664
It has to be an unknown.
665
Yeah.
666
But, Titanic is going to sink, but you still fucking watch the movie, right?
667
I don't know how.
668
And you don't, yeah,, there's a lot of, but there's, there's a ton of mini-gaps along the way.
669
A Rose and Jack can end up together.
670
There was room for two on that door.
671
That is true.
672
It's when they do the aerial shots.
673
And it's she's luxuriating in an embryo.
674
There's a lot of criticism for Rose over time.
675,, I'm not going to say anything about Rose.
676
I'm going to get some.
677
I probably have two of it.
678
There's a lot she could have done to help them out there.
679
It didn't have to end that way.
680
So, can I ask you, when you look at this hero guide transformation story gap, do you sit down with the team and literally map out how Omaze plays into those four?
681
Yeah.
682
We teach class to everybody at Omaze, no matter what your role is.
683
Why?
684
About storytelling.
685
It serves every part of the business.
686
Obviously, marketing, that's an obvious place.
687
Product is maybe an obvious place, understanding the customer psychology.
688
But fundraising,, if you think about it, what's evaluation?
689
Evaluation is just metrics plus a story equals valuation.
690
Right.
691
So we teach it to our finance team.
692
We teach it to our analytics team so they can be better storytellers to the rest of the company, so they can make their analysis usable for their customers, which is the rest of the company.
693
We've all had analytics people that think they're the heroes and they do this incredible, complicated analysis, and no one has to do it.
694
No one knows what to do with it.
695
Totally.
696
To what extent is marketing today losing the art and becoming science with the increased analytics data?
697
The science is really critical.
698
We believe deeply in the science.
699
We test each of these things within an inch of their life on every moment of what we're showing in a house or the call to action or whatever it is.
700, so that stuff is very important.
701
But the real gains, the real differentiation now is coming from creative.
702, a lot of people could,, these algorithms are reaching efficiency frontiers.
703
So,, that's really how you differentiate.
704
So, we have this beautiful framework for storytelling.
705
We now need a distribution channel.
706
When we were chatting before, you said TV was so impactful for you.
707
I can't quite remember the stats.
708
So, talk to me about TV and the lessons around TV.
709
Yeah, it's crazy.
710
It really works for us.
711
Is it your number one channel?
712
It used to be.
713
It's not anymore, but it's number two.
714
Commercials that work best on TV are 90 seconds.
715
90 seconds.
716
I think that's another misnomer around storytelling: shorter is always better.
717
That's not the case.
718
If the story is well told, you can keep them engaged for a longer time.
719
But yeah, 90-second commercials work really well for us.
720
How much does that cost?
721
Average?
722
Well, it really depends.
723
But, we're investing significant amounts in television.
724
What shows do you pay for?
725
Is this we're all everywhere?
726
We're in the Premier League.
727
We're Love Island.
728
Does Love Island do well for you?
729
Love Island does do well.
730
Love Island is a very highly educated audience.
731
High household income, high-educated.
732
Serious?
733
Serious.
734
Same in the U.S.
735 The Bachelor, the highest educated audience in the U.S.
736
is The Bachelor.
737
I'm so worried for society.
738
People want to escape.
739
Yeah, they do.
740
So $35, $40 million a year on TV.
741
Okay, great.
742
What's number one then?
743
What's replaced it?
744
Social.
745
Meta.
746
And that's Instagram.
747
Facebook itself still hits.
748
It really does.
749
It still works.
750
What's the split between Facebook and Insta?
751
Probably 80-20.
752
On Insta.
753
Yeah.
754
Wow.
755
And you have celebrities do the Instagrams because this is where I've seen it where you have,, Love Island stars or you name it.
756
What have been lessons in terms of using, I don't know how to say it, D-list celebrities?
757
How does that work?
758
Yeah, we put them in categories.
759
We have our celebrities,, we've had David Beckham or Prince William or those people promote houses.
760
You've had Prince William?
761
We did the London Air Ambulance and he's a patron of a charity.
762
So we partnered with him to fund the London Air Ambulance.
763
For people who don't live in London, these are these red helicopter ambulances that come and save people.
764
But that's not government funded.
765
It's charitably funded.
766
And the ambulances were 25 years old this year.
767
And so they had to, by law, they had to retire them.
768
And they needed to raise 20 million for new ambulances.
769
And they were 5 million short.
770
And so we did a campaign and raised that money for them.
771
Wow.
772
Okay, so we have Insta and Facebook with now number one.
773
Yeah.
774
How do we think about what it takes to do that well?
775
What are some big lessons from doing that as well as you have done?
776
Again, remembering what people care about.
777, we're lucky in that the product that we're offering, a new house, hits all of these principles that we're talking about, right?
778
It's all of Maslow's hierarchy of needs.
779
It's safety, it's security, it's status, its relationships, its self-actualization.
780
So, when someone looks at their Insta and sees a new house that could change their life, that is engaging.
781
So, we're working with a pretty strong story to begin with.
782
Does it not get boring?
783
And what by do you worry about that?
784, a house is amazing, but, after five houses, it's another house.
785
How do you think about that?
786
And I Seth Godin, I'm sure Seth Godin.
787
He says about the power of the purple cow, which is something you've never seen before, which is why you the Pope and a Lamborghini.
788
Huh, never seen that before.
789
But each house is different.
790
Each month there's a new house.
791
40% of all television in the world is about houses.
792 some house transformation show, some DIY.
793, 60% of all TV is reality, and two-thirds of that is about houses.
794, HGTV in the US is third only to ESPN and Fox News.
795
It's just about houses.
796
And that network has worked all around the world.
797
The food network only worked in three countries because food culture really changes.
798
HDTV has worked in 83 countries.
799, 40% is houses.
800
Yeah.
801
Nuts.
802
Taught me.
803
I'm always thinking about CACs going up over time as you saturate the core initial market or going down as my mother now was super excited that you were coming on the show and the brand of Omega's is much more known.
804
Does CAC go up or down over time?
805
I think the generally law of physics of CAC is that it goes up over time.
806
You can mitigate that, the natural course of things, by spreading your brand.
807, we're lucky in that this is a pretty broadly appealing product,, age-wise, gender-wise, household income-wise.
808
And so we're able to find new pockets of untapped audiences.
809
But we expect it to,, we model it to continue to go up over time.
810
I think a lot of people assume that you sign up, the house that you want goes, and then you churn.
811
That's not the case.
812
When we went for a walk around the park, you gave me some pretty insane numbers, facts about retention for this model.
813
How does this model look in terms of retention?
814
It's right up there with the top consumer subscription companies in the world.
815, it's comparable to Netflix, Spotify.
816
Nuts.
817
Yeah.
818
How big is the story gap?
819
Do you mind being put in the lottery basket?
820
We're not that.
821, we're a prize draw, so it's not technically what we do.
822
It is an entertainment product, others in that space are, but we're not fussed either way.
823
To what extent could and should you be more of a continuous content company?
824
And what by that is, should OMAZ not have a property show which details the transformation of a home that you buy?
825
And then instead of having these static two days or three day windows where you have this peak of subscriber acquisition, you have this continuous following on of the story of turning the house around.
826
You're a good strategist, Harry.
827
We're talking about this stuff right now.
828
Wouldn't that be great?
829
Yeah, we think there's endless amounts of content.
830
Let OMAZ TV follow the journey of turning this into the best house in Cheshire.
831
Cool.
832
Yeah, we think there's a lot of opportunity there, especially as we expand into different markets.
833
We're going to start doing transformation for different people in the UK.
834
Say we have a house that's going to be in Liverpool, right?
835
We would go find someone in Liverpool who's been doing great things in the community.
836
Guy named Harry is, he's mentoring entrepreneurs and he's doing out of a dilapidated community center.
837
We come up in the Omaze dreammobile.
838
We say, Harry, we've heard you've done great things.
839
We're going to help make your dream come true.
840
We're going to use our design team to redo this for you.
841
Another show of transformation.
842
So it's just different stories of transformation.
843
Do you think content is easier or harder than ever today?
844
The channels are constantly changing, but your capacity to produce it is easier than ever.
845
You have so many tools.
846
And so I think to get attention is harder than ever, but to produce content is easier than ever.
847
Would it have worked if you were starting Omaze today?
848
I think so.
849
I don't know if the talent would have worked as well.
850
I think we would have a harder time breaking through.
851
And do you think it would have been as interesting?
852 we spoke earlier about news cycles being much faster today.
853
If you have a breaking bad, that's amazing, but we also have Trump buying a Tesla and a war.
854
And it just takes so much more to cut through the news cycle that a breaking bad prize draw is a good thing.
855
Yeah, I think we would have had a hard time today.
856
We were constantly onboarding talent onto social to say, hey, here's a way to reach your audience and raise money for a cause that you care about.
857
They're now, everybody does that, right?
858
Influencers wasn't even a thing back then.
859
I don't think the talent version would have, if we launched today, would have done as well.
860
I think the house part is very enduring for all the reasons we talked about.
861
And so I think that still would.
862
What do people think they know or get wrong about micro-influencers?
863
I think they underestimate their power and sometimes overestimate their power depending on where they are.
864, I think they underestimate the power of small communities and engaged communities.
865
Gymshark is such a good example.
866
Yeah, they do.
867
But,, Clean Talk,, there's a whole TikTok board of people who love cleaning.
868 that, that community is rabid.
869
They buy crazy amounts of products.
870
Plant talk, same thing.
871 people who talk about how you optimize the plants in your house.
872 there's just, you can do real business through those things.
873
Sometimes I wonder why I'm single and then I look at those and I'm, well, fuck if they can get married.
874
If you can run plant talk and get married,, there's got to be hope for me.
875
What do you think people get wrong about micro-influencers?
876
I think people, to your point, I think they underestimate them and I think they think it's harder to get them and find them than they think.
877 most of them are still very much hand to mouth needing money, respectfully.
878
And so you can message them and say, I want to do a partnership with you.
879
This is my brand and this is what I pay you.
880
And I think it's much easier to acquire them than you think.
881
I think you can also use UTM links and a lot more attributable tools to get clear ROI back on your campaigns.
882
I don't think they are just brand marketing in a way that, sorry, TV might more be so.
883
Does that make sense?
884
But I think heavy specialization, super important to your point of plant talk, clean talk.
885
So totally agree.
886, Canva,, Canva.
887
Canva talk has been one of the biggest breakthroughs for them.
888
Yeah, the Notion templates on TikTok's also been unbelievably successful for them.
889
How's TikTok been for you?
890
It's great.
891
It's emerging for us, but we have big plans for it.
892
We look at the house as a surface area to be able to do all these things.
893
So we're going to start allowing influencers to go to the houses and do something around the gym in the house, something around the plants in the house, something around the food in the house, something,, it just creates an opportunity for all those communities to make sense.
894
You pay the influencers now, correct?
895
The influencers we pay, the celebrities, do not, because they're doing it.
896
It's for their charity.
897
What if you commissioned the influencers, not paid them?
898
So what if you said, whatever we take, I'll give you 10%.
899
Yeah, we've done all sorts of different affiliate deals.
900
And so that's the same thing.
901
And paid works best.
902
We do a variety of stuff.
903
It's different relationships with different people.
904
Okay.
905
No,, it's performance.
906
It's typically performance driven, but there's some that have different, depending on the reach, less micro-influencers, but some bigger influencers.
907
Was there ever a house that just totally tanked?
908
Oh, yeah.
909
Oh, we almost went out of business.
910
How did you always go out of business?
911
Because this was seeming so good.
912
I know.
913
We went almost out of business so many times.
914
How come?
915
Because we missed that in this.
916
How come we almost went out?
917
Yeah, what happened?
918
In the old OMEZ 1.0, the celebrities were starting to plateau.
919
We saw that.
920
And we got, and so we started to think about, okay, what new products do we need to create to combat that?
921
We then got an inbound acquisition offer from a really famous CEO with a famous company.
922
And so then we had the choice of, okay, we really don't have the resources to do both of these well.
923
Which one are we going to focus on?
924
So we decided to go for the offer, spent six months on that.
925
How much was the offer?
926
I'm not going to share that, but I'm glad we didn't do it.
927
But it was, at the time, it would have been a great outcome for us.
928
And we spent six months just focused on that.
929
It's all I thought about.
930
And then it fell through on my actual birthday when I had a, I was hosting a whole thing.
931
And so then we're, oh man, okay, now we've just wasted six months, not solved this problem.
932
Then I had the actual near-death experience.
933
So then I'm out for many more months.
934
So when I came back, we were really just skating by.
935
Then we flipped to the prize model, started to take off again.
936
And we wanted to go towards the houses.
937
And we felt confident we're going to be able to raise a round.
938
So we started making some investments in the houses.
939
And then we were supposed to close the round on March 13th, 2020, which is not a great week to close around.
940
If you remember that week, March 11th is when Tom Hanks got coronavirus, and then the NBA player got coronavirus.
941
The number two investor in the round was an NBA owner.
942
March 12th, the stock, the U.S.
943
stock market went down 30%.
944
And then on the Friday, they pulled out of the round.
945
Understandably, it felt the world was melting.
946
And we were done then.
947
That was a death knell for us.
948
So I went to him and said, look, this was a competitive round.
949
We brought you in because of your reputation for supporting entrepreneurs.
950
You've got to give us a chance to show you how we're going to make it through this.
951
And he's, all right, let's meet next week.
952
I was, no, let's meet Monday.
953
Because you're running out of cash.
954
Yeah, we're out of cash.
955
This is not going to get better.
956
It's one of those moments where you were trying to say, yeah, we need it now.
957
They're meeting today, but you don't want to say I'm out on Wednesday.
958
Yeah, exactly.
959
And also,, we had enough to get through that, but each new piece of information was not going to be good.
960
That was clear.
961
And so people were not going to get more bullish over the next couple of weeks.
962
So we said Monday.
963
And then we, we literally, our team spent 48 hours totally redoing our deck that had taken us,, however long to put together in the first place.
964
And we,, did research on the growth of e-commerce during SARS in 2003, all this research about eblonic plague from 1917.
965
There was this explosion of commerce in the streets of London.
966
You would not believe TikTok during the Spanish flu was huge.
967
And then Sheen came into London in 1918 and short form went to the moon.
968, are you, this seems made up.
969
That's hilarious.
970
Yeah, we did, but we showed all this stuff and why we thought people were going to be in their houses and they were going to care more about winning stuff.
971
They're going to need entertainment and all this stuff.
972
Did that prove out?
973
It did.
974
We didn't really know that at the time.
975
Obviously, no one did.
976
But then, so then we presented to them on that Monday.
977
And then he called me on a Tuesday and said, all right, we're in.
978
And I literally.
979
It was a $10 million check.
980
But the whole, they were the number two in the round.
981
Rick Heitzman and First Mark was leading the round.
982
But if they would have fallen out, it just would have made the rest of the round.
983
Not Rick, but the other check would have made the rest of it really difficult.
984
And I remember getting that call and literally, I just collapsed.
985 I fell to the ground.
986
I just started wailing.
987, because it had been three years of crazy stuff,, I thought each one of those was the thing that we had to overcome.
988
And then so when it finally came through, it was,, it was just such a release,.
989
Daniel from UiPath said to it, it was one of the most powerful moments I've had on a show.
990
He said,, I think everyone thinks they want to be me, but I spend a lot of time alone in my head.
991
And it's, it's quite lonely.
992
And I think I felt very seen, which is why I see a therapist.
993
When I think to that moment, it can also be a lonely moment, even in success sometimes.
994
How do you think about, and again, my advice, I hope you're a friend.
995
How would you advise me on the loneliness that comes with being a CEO, having been so much more successful than me?
996
Well, I would argue with that.
997
You're incredibly successful.
998
What you build is amazing.
999
It's a great question.
1000
I would say I probably even spend more alone time now than I did, but feel less alone.
1001
And I think back to that moment, I was totally alone.
1002
And one of the biggest moments of my life, I'm crying on the ground by myself.
1003
I'm probably the only one who really could have even understand it,?
1004
But I think I've learned to create a better relationship with myself.
1005
I used to be horrible to myself.
1006, I used to beat myself up.
1007
I used to say stuff to meet myself that if a friend said it to me, I'd no longer be friends with that person.
1008
And it took me a long time, took me going through what I did.
1009
Do you not tell yourself that's what's needed?
1010, I beat myself up, but I tell myself that that's what kicks me in the ass and makes me better.
1011
Is that wrong?
1012
I don't think it's wrong, I think, but I think it evolves.
1013
And so I think you have to decide if it's still serving you in the way.
1014
And it was no longer serving me in the way that it once did.
1015
I thought the only way to be motivated was to beat myself up and be better.
1016
And you're happy more and you're bad for all these reasons.
1017
And then I just learned to be a better friend to myself and recognize that supporting through these things is going to make me work even harder.
1018
It's making me waste less time on repetitive thoughts.
1019, I saw, I read some study the other day from the NSF that said the average person has 30,000 thoughts a day.
1020
80% of them are negative and 95% of them are repetitive.
1021
And I would bet you I was higher than 80% and 95% on those things.
1022
And that's just not that useful.
1023
Is there anything you do, though, to stop yourself?
1024
Yeah, absolutely.
1025
So I have a very regimented meditation, working out, sleep, food, all those things are designed to create that space.
1026
You meditate?
1027
I have to work really hard to do it.
1028
What do you do?
1029
Help me.
1030
I meditate twice a day.
1031
I have a protocol that I use that I learned from this teacher who I think is incredibly valuable.
1032
It's a guy named Jim George.
1033
How long do you meditate for each time?
1034
20 minutes.
1035
20 minutes a time.
1036
Yeah.
1037
You listen to one of my podcasts.
1038
I listen to a lot of your podcasts.
1039
Listener a lot.
1040
Okay, so we have the meditation.
1041
I have the meditation twice a day.
1042, very serious you are about fitness and health.
1043
Maybe not as serious as you.
1044
You do two marathons a weekend, which is absolutely insane.
1045
But that's a part of it.
1046
Sleep's obviously a part of it.
1047
I do journals around intentions.
1048, I think that stuff really matters if done the right way.
1049
So yeah, I just have created a sequence of how to do this stuff.
1050
The other thing I did is I did this thing called the Hoffman process.
1051
Have you ever heard of that?
1052
I have.
1053
We had Scooter Braun on the show.
1054
Oh, really?
1055
And he said that Hoffman changed his life.
1056
It definitely changed my life.
1057
How so?
1058
It is a work of genius.
1059
That whole process is true genius in action.
1060
But it fundamentally changes your relation.
1061
It changed my relationship to me.
1062
It made me understand what it, what self-love means.
1063
And every time I hear that term, it sounds, I don't know, so cheesy.
1064
I don't know how to avoid that.
1065
But, there was a point in the process where someone said, hey, do you ever hold grudges?
1066
And I said, no, I don't.
1067
I always forgive people.
1068
And they're, yeah, but do you ever hold grudges against yourself?
1069
Sure.
1070
I was, there's stuff I did 10 years ago I haven't forgiven myself for.
1071
And it's, is that still serving me?
1072
I don't think it is.
1073
So I've, I still get these moments, these fears, all these things, but then I can just process through them.
1074 Hoffman teaches you how to rewire your brain to process through them much faster.
1075
Did it make you a much better leader?
1076
I hope so.
1077
I don't think I would have been able to make the decisions I made around switching to business, going from US to UK.
1078
I think how I show up in meetings, how I receive bad news has fundamentally changed.
1079
On decisions, you said it before about above the line and below the line.
1080
What's the difference?
1081
It's similar to what we were saying before: of, are you making a decision from a place of fear or expansion?
1082
You can make the same decision from two different places.
1083
You still make very hard decisions.
1084
I've still done massive layoffs, let people go, given tough feedback.
1085
Is layoffs the hardest decision you've made?
1086
Yeah, it was.
1087, we shut down our whole U.S.
1088
team to focus on the house model in the UK.
1089
As awful as this sounds, was that easier than traditional layoffs where you leave people there?
1090
And what by that is layoffs suck often because you've got to retain them that hope, the optimism in a team that's still there.
1091
They've said goodbye to their friends.
1092
Here it's, you're amazing.
1093
You're great.
1094
We're shutting down the whole thing.
1095
It's not you.
1096
It really is us.
1097
And that's because we're closing everything here.
1098
Yeah, it might have been.
1099
I've done both of those.
1100
Keeping the morale of people after others have left can be challenging, but it can also be galvanizing.
1101
I think letting that go was just,, it's so much part of your identity.
1102
It's also you care, you developed a real bond.
1103 a lot of those people have been there 10, 12 years,, since the very beginning.
1104
Do you tie the performance of the company to your happiness?
1105
I used to,, 100%.
1106
I don't.
1107
I'm much better now.
1108
I can't say I'm totally, that I totally separate those things.
1109
I think of it as so much more than just a business.
1110
I think for all of us who work at Omegas, I think we feel we're part of something that is bigger than us individually, that we're able to make a real ripple effect, and that it's not about any of us individually.
1111
And so I care about serving that mission in a really deep way.
1112
But I am better now at separating my identity from it.
1113
Everyone says building a business in the UK is shit.
1114
We did Project Europe.
1115
You're an American in London.
1116
What do people think about building in the UK that isn't how it is?
1117
I didn't have a ton of preconceived notions coming.
1118
I loved building in the UK.
1119
I think there's great talent here.
1120
I think there's great educational institutions that create great talent.
1121
People are very motivated by the collective.
1122
You get a lot of immigrant talent, so you get a lot of different ways of thinking.
1123
So I think it's a great place to run a business.
1124
I think it's a very dynamic.
1125
London is an incredibly dynamic city.
1126
It's the only city in the world where you have a relevant center for politics, a relevant center for entertainment, a relevant center for finance that are within a mile of each other.
1127
And so that creates a dynamism.
1128
I know all the narratives now about the UK and Europe are sinking into the ocean, but I just don't experience that.
1129
If you were to advise the Prime Minister today on stimulating startup growth optimism, you were advising him today.
1130
What would you advise him?
1131
I feel you're better poised to answer that.
1132
What would your advice be?
1133
You have to make the UK a magnet for the best talent to build here.
1134, one of the best things about the startup team 10 years ago, well, 12, 13 years ago, was Ravolut, Monzo, transfer-wise.
1135
What is the commonality there?
1136
FinTechs that really benefited from a financial services hub that London was and a very open regulatory stance towards financial data that allowed them to build those businesses better than they would have been elsewhere.
1137
That enabled the birth of those businesses.
1138
We need to make the UK an unbelievably friendly place for the best developers to build.
1139
I totally agree.
1140
I think also a lot of the things coming out of universities are really hard to commercialize.
1141
A lot of the biotech, a lot of the AI advancements, that commercializes way faster, and there's a lot less impediments.
1142
So there should be ways of inflecting that too.
1143
I always ask this: did you always know that you would be successful?
1144
No.
1145
I think deep down, I believe I had the potential.
1146
There were so many times along this journey where I was, we are fucked.
1147
If you would have told the 10-year ago me or the five-year-ago me, we were here right now, you would have been, what are you talking about?
1148
The best way to think about our business is a third, a third, a third.
1149
So a third goes to VAT and charity.
1150
So 16% to VAT, 17% to charity.
1151
Spend about a third on pricing.
1152
So the house plus the taxes, we cover all the taxes for the winter.
1153
We cover all the furniture.
1154
We give them 250,000 pounds to move in.
1155
And then we have a bunch of sub-prizes cars and other cash and that stuff.
1156
And then a third is marketing and operating expenses.
1157
And out of that comes our profit.
1158
And so,, at scale, this will be roughly a 30% EBITDA margin business.
1159
We're not there now.
1160
Okay, and we're just in the UK.
1161
Just in the UK.
1162
Why do we go next?
1163
And we've announced Australia, which we're really excited about.
1164
Why did you choose Australia?
1165
There's obviously a lot of reasons that it's not the obvious choice.
1166
It's not very close.
1167
It's not the biggest market.
1168
But,, this has been such an extraordinary success here that we wanted to remove as many variables as possible.
1169
So language, obsession with property, regulatory population density.
1170
Even though Australia is a much larger country, 83% of the population lives on the East Coast.
1171
The distance from Melbourne to Brisbane is almost identical from London to Edinburgh.
1172
So, and there's been proof that that's really worked there.
1173
So that's the other thing that's really helpful.
1174
If you're doing something and it's not working, if that other people have done it, you at least know that it's your execution, not some fundamental lack of demand in the market.
1175
So we'd rather have competitive risk than demand risk.
1176
So that's why we chose that.
1177
And I think consumer, as you said, consumer reception towards property, very, very similar.
1178
I'd say the Australian is much more in love with property than the UK.
1179
Oh, absolutely.
1180
It's an obsession.
1181, it's the way their tax system is set up.
1182
It's the most efficient way to build wealth.
1183
And so that's why you have that.
1184
At your size, you could go public today.
1185
Why don't you?
1186
I think being bigger when you go public is really important now.
1187
I've watched a lot of companies that were,, in relatively small market caps.
1188
You can just, you're better set up to weather the increased volatility of the world and that volatility is only going to increase.
1189
And the nature of the markets leads,, with retail investors and everything else leads to increased volatility.
1190
The question I'm asking now is, why would you go public?
1191
And I'm not saying specifically you, but I'm saying any private company.
1192
We have incredibly large amounts of capital that's willing to go into private markets in this extended privatization window.
1193
You're seeing companies Stripe very publicly say, listen, if you needed a 28-year-old analyst at a bank to say increase your margins, you probably are not a great business anyway.
1194
The idea that you get better discipline is just a sign of a poorly managed company.
1195
The question then becomes, why go public?
1196, there's a lot of reasons to not go public.
1197, you don't have to deal with the volatility of the yen carry trade, reducing morale in your business.
1198
And if you're Stripe or you're SpaceX, then you have access to liquidity in ways that are pretty similar to being public.
1199
Not every company, though, is Stripe or SpaceX.
1200
It's still the most efficient way to, in most impactful way, for most companies to get liquidity for their investors and their shareholders.
1201
It's still...
1202
on the margin brings down the cost of capital.
1203
It still can be a branding moment for some companies that is important in terms of their international expansion.
1204
It's more of a question than it once was, but it's not everybody are those companies.
1205
Would you go public in the UK?
1206
We're going to keep all our options open.
1207
I had Nick on the show, and there are some shows when you have to be a journalist because if you're not, it will discredit the entire show.
1208 you have to ask Nick, are you going to go public and why are you going to go public?
1209
And I was, I'm not going to get an answer, but I'm just going to ask it anyway, because then at least no one can shit on me.
1210
So I asked and he's, it is not a rational decision.
1211
And I'm, wow, that was incredibly direct.
1212
Okay, well, great.
1213
Thanks, Nick.
1214
And the team's, yeah, sure.
1215
You can keep it real.
1216
Yeah, sure.
1217
You can keep it.
1218
I'm, wow, fuck.
1219
Okay.
1220
That got syndicated everywhere.
1221
I remember reading that.
1222
Was that from your show?
1223
Yeah.
1224
That's hilarious.
1225
Yeah, yeah.
1226
That came up at our board meeting.
1227
That's funny.
1228
So, Matt, would you go public in the UK?
1229
Keeping our options open.
1230
My honest question is, and you don't need to answer this, but,, why would you?
1231
Yeah, when you can go public in the US, especially when you have a brand Omaze does.
1232
You go public, especially here, if you really don't have a US consumer brand.
1233
That's hard.
1234
But Omaze does have a public-facing brand.
1235
It is a very clear story that you could tell U.S.
1236
investors easily.
1237
For elevator door closures in Sheffield, it's difficult to make that a sexy story.
1238
Trust me, there's some really big businesses.
1239
I bet you there are.
1240
I love those businesses.
1241
But it's really tough to make that a US success story.
1242
Yes.
1243
Can I ask you a weird one, please?
1244
The bigger we get, the more I seem to doubt myself, ironically.
1245
It's just more people telling me that I'm shit and that I'm useless.
1246
And I have my mothers do that.
1247
So where do you doubt yourself most today?
1248, I think it's mostly around people decisions because people are just hard.
1249
There's never a right way or wrong way to do things.
1250
So I'm constantly adjusting.
1251, we have our virtues that we're very serious about living that we reinforce.
1252
And one of them is you can offer feedback.
1253
Another was raise the bar.
1254
And so I'm constantly trying to figure out the right cadence of that.
1255
I could give feedback every day to every single person if I wanted to, but that would probably be overkill.
1256
And so how do you continue to raise the bar by also understanding when people are maxed out?
1257
We're a very small team.
1258
We're only 57 full-time people at the revenue.
1259
So it's 57.
1260
Yeah.
1261
We have another almost 52 contractors that are doing production.
1262
So you could say our company is really 109 people, but it's pretty.
1263
That's 7 million ahead.
1264
Yeah, it's an efficient business.
1265
But we're bringing on more people, but, more senior people.
1266
But,, we're still a pretty tight group in terms of how we operate.
1267
And so that.
1268
7 million ahead.
1269
That's nuts.
1270
Yeah.
1271
So there's much higher guy.
1272 we analyze the per head revenue, and that's wow.
1273
Well done.
1274
Thank you.
1275, it's we have a really good team, really smart people, really efficient.
1276
We've made mistakes on overhiring before.
1277
But on people, you doubt yourself most in terms of the hiring, in terms of the retention, in terms of the motivation.
1278
It's just knowing the right amount.
1279
It's not, I think I'm generally pretty good at it because I really care about the people who work and I care about their development and I push towards that.
1280
But finding the right amount is a constant evolution.
1281
That's where I probably spend the most time calibrating.
1282
What's been the biggest change in the way that you manage people?
1283
So for me, I used to have this, I will lead this way, blanket.
1284
And I've changed to understand that some people require a carrot and some a stick.
1285
And I will change the type of leader that I am for the individual that's receiving it to get the most out of them.
1286
I would say that's also been my lesson.
1287
There's this guy named General Anthony Zinni.
1288
He's a four-star general in the U.S.
1289
We did an experience with him at the very beginning.
1290
We would do stuff play chess with a four-star general and stuff,, stuff that.
1291
We didn't get a lot of celebrities.
1292
But anyway, he ran all of troops for NATO.
1293
And so basically, he had,, the Army, the Marines, the Navy, plus whatever, however many different countries is part of that.
1294
So just think about all the different cultures that you're having to navigate.
1295
I was, that feels the most intense leadership challenge ever.
1296
How did you do that?
1297
And he's, you realize that all relationships are just between two people and each person's different.
1298
So you have to constantly adjust that.
1299
Now, you create your systemic messaging that is true to you, but then you have to adjust to the people.
1300
I used to think that everyone wanted to operate the same way that I did.
1301
That's wrong.
1302
I think the other thing I learned too is what leadership is, is much more about, I used to make myself the hero.
1303
And my job is to make my team the hero and set them up for success.
1304
And then,, I would try to do more things because I thought it would help them, but, I was getting in the way of what they could do.
1305
And so, creating the right guard rils to allow them to flourish.
1306
I know you've railed against on your show about the, against the word empowerment.
1307
I rail against it because empowerment and alignment are two words that are used by execs, and they just are fluffy bullshit.
1308
I disagree.
1309
I think alignment in most cases.
1310
I'm smart enough to know there's a caveat.
1311
Why do you disagree, though?
1312
Because alignment saves time.
1313
We're really clear: okay, this is our moonshot, this is our North Star, this is how we're getting there.
1314
And then everybody needs to be able to articulate what their role is in getting to that place.
1315
So we have them all write it out on a Google Doc.
1316
So everyone's, this my role connects to the strategy, connects to the North Star in this way.
1317
And by doing that, then that should enable them to say.
1318
So what's the doc that has alignment baked into it?
1319, what does it have?
1320
It has North Star metric.
1321
We have our yearly North Star metric.
1322
We have our five pillars of our strategy.
1323
And we have our OKRs.
1324
So it's, how are we going to get where we want to go?
1325
Which is the strategy?
1326
Where are we going this year?
1327
Which is our North Star?
1328
What are you going to do next?
1329
Which are your OKRs?
1330
And then your job as an individual on the team is to write about how your work connects to each of those things.
1331
By doing that, you create coherence within an organization where then people can say, no, don't do that.
1332
And we try to celebrate that.
1333, tell us about a time that you said no to something.
1334
Strategy is a lot of times about what you say no to.
1335
And so they should constantly be on the lookout for things that they should not do that saves them time.
1336
What did you say no to that you should have said yes to?
1337
Oh man.
1338
Do you have a good answer to that?
1339
The deal pre-seed round.
1340
The Vanta seed round.
1341
Oh.
1342
I said no to SpaceX early.
1343
I'm more saying about operating for you with Omega.
1344
Yeah, I know.
1345
I said no to video super early.
1346, we have 10 times a bigger audience on audio than we do on video.
1347
Why?
1348
Purely because I've been doing audio for 10 years.
1349
And I thought the video people wouldn't open up as much.
1350
They felt much more comfortable on audio.
1351
Wrong.
1352
Completely wrong.
1353
I initially said no to subscriptions before we got to House a Month.
1354
James, who I mentioned, Ahmed, Prem, the leaders on our team, they thought we could do subscriptions with a house every other month.
1355
I was, no, you got to wait till this comes.
1356
People wanted, they were right.
1357
I was wrong.
1358
And change the business faster.
1359
Final one.
1360
What did you do that you wish you hadn't done?
1361
I just made so many mistakes in my life.
1362
It's really hard to narrow it down.
1363
I think it's a series of failures.
1364
I was an actor for a while.
1365
I was really bad at it.
1366
Did it help you to become a better CEO though?
1367
I think so.
1368
Yeah.
1369
I think so.
1370
If I want to justify.
1371
It does help you storytell.
1372
I think it helps you to see the world through the eyes of another, which I think helps with marketing and product.
1373
Do you agree with vulnerability and leadership?
1374
I do.
1375
Do you not think sometimes you need to put on a mask, a facade, to say to everyone, it's okay.
1376
And deep down, you're really not that sure.
1377
I think you need to do that too.
1378
I don't think vulnerability is about just being totally open every time you feel any fear.
1379
It's you got to pick your moments.
1380
But I think the old school image of a leader, which was,, General Patton, Jack Welsh,, I know everything at all times and we're going to take that hill and nothing's going to get our way.
1381, it's not real.
1382
It doesn't work anymore.
1383
And so, I think you have to be candid about when you're not sure what the answer is.
1384
And when you do have concerns,, as a leader, you also have to be able to work past those because people can clue off your energy.
1385
That's why we practice laughter within our company.
1386
We invest in it, we hire for it.
1387
So, when you get in those difficult situations, I'm always working to be as lighthearted as possible and have as much fun as possible in the really shit times,, some of our biggest laughs is when we're, we might go out of business next week, and, because then you're you can come to a solution faster that way because you get a little distance from the problem.
1388, we're 400 million and revenue, and I didn't think you've got that moment so much anymore.
1389
We don't have anymore, no, but, we used to have it a lot.
1390
You normalize it as well, right?
1391
It's I've been here before, yes, yeah, yeah, the first time sucks, yeah, the fifth lawsuit, you're, wow, yeah, had that TS.
1392
Did you ever have lawsuits?
1393
We did.
1394
What was the worst lawsuit?
1395
Oh, man, we had we had these guys who basically were they were recruiting plaintiffs on Facebook to sue Omaze.
1396
These guys had also recently before that had sued ginger ale for not having enough ginger in the ginger, a ginger ale company for not having enough ginger.
1397
These guys were Harvard and Yale lawyers that were just farming for some tort that they could do, exploiting the U.S.
1398
system.
1399
Anyway, they had people suing us or they gathered people, they brought a lawsuit that one said both that people didn't really understand the odds, that,, some people thought that they automatically won and therefore we were misleading.
1400
We're, at no point are we communicating that everybody wins these things?
1401, this is that seems, that's crazy.
1402
That the fact that people could enter for it was a sweepstakes in the U.S.
1403
The fact that people could enter for free was a problem that was following the law.
1404, there's just all this,, crazy stuff.
1405
We ended up winning it, but it was so crazy.
1406
That's nuts.
1407
There's so much of that in the U.S.
1408, it's just so value-destroying.
1409
Oh, my God.
1410
Your approach to legals in the U.S.
1411
is lawsuit, lawsuit, lawsuit.
1412
Be a lawyer in the U.S.
1413
is the takeaway.
1414
It's really not great for society.
1415
Dude, I want to do a quick fire round.
1416
So I say a short statement and you give me your immediate thoughts.
1417
Does that sound okay?
1418
Sounds good.
1419
What do you believe that most around you disbelieve?
1420
I think people are more alike than different.
1421
Biggest mistake you see early stage founders make?
1422
They try to do too much.
1423
Focus is the price of greatness.
1424
Did you ever lose focus?
1425
Yes.
1426
Where?
1427
In the beginning, we were doing a whole content series alongside all the celebrities and t-shirts, and we did all sorts of stuff.
1428
What do most people think they know about content, but they don't?
1429
That shorter is necessarily better.
1430
It's funny.
1431
Now that is just the prevailing conventional wisdom.
1432, no one has the attention span.
1433
Yeah.
1434
But I think longer requires more skill.
1435
Yeah, they don't have the attention for boring stuff.
1436
Longer requires.
1437
You have to get in faster than you once did, but it can still work.
1438
What have you changed your mind on in the last 12 months?
1439
I think that back to the people are more alike than different.
1440
I thought going into new markets, we were going to have to wildly customize for that market.
1441
I've heard people talk about this on your show.
1442
The Revoluth Growth Guy talked about this.
1443
But I think, especially when you're talking about a product they have or we have, which is core to survival in a customer's mind, a lot of the way you communicate with people can be the same from market to market.
1444
What consumer brand do you most admire and respect?
1445
I love Yeti.
1446
Why?
1447
It's a great product.
1448
They're incredible storytellers.
1449
They're, they totally understand this at a fundamental level.
1450, you'll see an ad for them that says, be the guy with a story about the bear.
1451
That's genius.
1452, that is.
1453
Why is that genius?
1454
Because it makes the customer the hero.
1455
It shows a moment, it shows a transformation for them, right?
1456, you go from someone going, I'm already that guy.
1457
Yeah, exactly.
1458
And so it creates a sense of adventure.
1459
Yeti is a perfect guide for that experience.
1460, their products are great to go out and do that.
1461
It hits all of it in a really visceral way.
1462
You can be C of any other company for a day.
1463
Which one?
1464
Netflix.
1465
Why?
1466
Because I think it's the perfect blend of science and art.
1467
Obviously, I love storytelling.
1468
I love content.
1469
They do that incredibly well.
1470
But the way they do it understands these principles, but also uses,, best in class technology to do these things.
1471
What concerns you most in the world today?
1472
Inequality of opportunity.
1473
These much differences there are seen in the world.
1474
I think we all, most humans would agree, would agree in the power of competition or the importance of competition.
1475
And that if smart people work hard, they should be able to go up the ladder in society.
1476
And I think that we are making that harder and harder to do.
1477
Do you?
1478
Yeah.
1479
When you look at social and you can DM someone and get in 20 minutes in their calendar if you do it really well.
1480
When you look at lovable and you're able to build websites simply with words and the democratization of development skills, I think it is easier than ever to build products, distribute them, sell services.
1481
I think we have more quality of opportunity than ever.
1482
I would agree with you.
1483
There are more tools and there's more access to information than ever before.
1484
I think there are a lot of structural impediments built into societies, value capture, regulatory capture at the top, especially in the U.S., that makes it harder for people to get started and to move up.
1485
That's why you build in Europe.
1486
I love the U.S.
1487
We're headed back there.
1488
You can tell your graduating self any advice.
1489
What do you say?
1490
Everyone is scared.
1491
Are you still scared?
1492
Yeah, of course.
1493
The point is just, I used to think the fear made it so I didn't have the constitution to be an entrepreneur.
1494
I would look at,, these famous people Richard Branson or Oprah, a different entrepreneur, and be, oh, wow, they must have always at all times knew exactly what they're doing and felt curved.
1495
And then I've met these people or others that we think that of, and you realize,, oh, they feel the same fear.
1496
They just process through it fast.
1497
And so,, it's okay.
1498
I have to ask this one.
1499
It's not who was the most amazing person you met that really left a mark?
1500
Jon Stewart.
1501
The actor.
1502
Yeah, the daily.
1503
He had the daily show.
1504
Yeah.
1505
Because I think he used humor.
1506
I said this before, but we believe laughter is the shortest distance between two people.
1507
I think he used humor to raise consciousness and awareness around societal issues in a way that if he didn't have the humor, he couldn't.
1508
I think he's incredibly articulate and balanced in the way that he looks at things.
1509
But also,, we did an experience where you got to be in his writer's room for a day.
1510
And so I watched him lead and the camaraderie and the fun that they had producing a very stressful show day in, day out.
1511 that's really hard that had to react to the news and then write comedy about the news that had happened that day.
1512 think how hard that is.
1513
And the organizational setup that they had and the creative machine that they had.
1514 we modeled,, I learned a lot from that to model our creative machine.
1515
And I thought that was really impressive.
1516
How did you model your creative machine on his?
1517
What did you change or do?
1518
The process with which they ideate that then goes to a room where they beat up the ideation and stress test it.
1519
And then the testing and how they learn from the episodes before.
1520
At one point, we were producing 400 celebrity videos a year,, and our team figured out that process.
1521
We were really good at learning from that process.
1522, that's why we,, that's why we were the only ones who did a celebrity that made it.
1523
We've committed WME try to do it, CAA tried to do it.
1524
Even Airbnb and Groupon at the time tried to do it.
1525
But that machine is why we were able to beat them.
1526
And so we learned watching that from him.
1527
A final one for you.
1528
What question are you not ever asked by employees, by media, by investors that you find strange that you're not asked?
1529
Can you reach up and grab that thing for me?
1530
I'm short.
1531
That I'm finding it strange that I'm not asked.
1532
What's the best answer you've heard of this one?
1533
I don't know.
1534
What one for me is,, I've done a lot quite early in my life.
1535
What has allowed you to achieve quite a lot that you're maybe not proud of?
1536
Oh, that's a great question.
1537
What's the answer to that?
1538
Addiction.
1539
You're addicted?
1540
I'm an alcoholic.
1541
I'm bulimic.
1542
I'm a workaholic.
1543
I literally have the ability to get addicted to almost anything in a very unhealthy way.
1544, and you see that in,, psoriasis and heart palpitations.
1545
And it allows me to, I think, be one of the best at what I do, but it's not something I'm particularly proud of.
1546
Is that your neurology or is that something you, because something happened in your childhood that has made you that way?
1547
I don't know.
1548
Do you think you can be great without being absolutely not?
1549
And there's definitions of great.
1550
Yeah, it really depends on how you're doing.
1551
Which is you can make a lot of money.
1552
Yeah, but do you want to be number one in a category and reshape how a generation experiences a large product?
1553
No, you can't be.
1554
Do you feel fulfilled by what you've achieved?
1555
No.
1556
Do you think less fulfilled with every day?
1557
Really?
1558
Less fulfilled every day.
1559
Do you think feeling fulfilled will make you less ambitious?
1560
Yeah.
1561
I,, I don't know if you've ever had a dog, but, yeah, they're always hungry.
1562
You never want to be content.
1563
Do you think being fulfilled and hungry are mutually exclusive?
1564
I almost do.
1565
Yeah, I've changed my mind on that.
1566
I know, but that's why I need to go to Hoffman.
1567
I should go to Hoffman.
1568
I should.
1569
I think you'll be just as hungry, but you'll enjoy it more.
1570
Are you hungry and enjoy it?
1571
Yes.
1572
What do you not enjoy that you would most to remove?
1573
Some of the administrative tasks.
1574
I don't love.
1575, I'll do a lot of them, but if I have to do any of them, I'm fairly impatient for them.
1576
Look, there's a lot of things through this journey.
1577, I used to write site copy and contract partnerships and all these things.
1578
I didn't love all that stuff when I was doing it, but I felt it was the best thing I could do to serve what we were doing.
1579
Final one: where is Omaze in 10 years?
1580
We mentioned the Australia plans.
1581
We mentioned the 400 million revenue run, right?
1582
It's not our 10-year vision, but it's our 15-year vision.
1583
Is Fortune 500 impact number one?
1584
The Fortune 500 is right now 8 billion in revenue to be on that list.
1585
Impact number one means the number one source of charitable funds in the world outside of government.
1586
Right now, that's the Gates Foundation.
1587
We think the math is on our side to be able to do both those things.
1588
That requires expansion into 14 markets.
1589
I think we can do that.
1590
Matt, listen, I think it's the most incredible story.
1591
I have so much respect, admiration for you.
1592
