1
How freaking awesome the U.S.
2
capitalist system is.
3, the big, I was saying the sound button on this: the United States has four percent of the world's people, we have roughly 23 percent of the world's GDP, we have 67 percent of the world's market cap and the stock exchange.
4
Right, we won.
5
US corporations are efficient, they're highly valued, they have international businesses.
6, not just our GDP, which is our income, is higher than our population ratio, but our wealth, our corporate sector, is even higher than our GDP.
7
It's my favorite show of the week.
8
Jason Lemkin and Rory O'Driscoll join me for a news breakdown.
9
Today, we discuss all the IPOs that we've seen happen in the last week, including the incredible pops from Core Weave and from Circle.
10
Then, also, we discuss Elon and Trump, what it means for Elon companies, and then we also discuss Rich Wong's statements from Excel that 20% of unicorns will fail.
11
Is that correct?
12
And how do we think these zombie corns will play out?
13
But before we dive in today, here are two fun facts about our newest brand sponsor, Kajabi.
14
First, their customers just crossed a collective $8 billion in total revenue.

37
What comes to mind when you think about business banking?
38
Probably not speed, ease, or growth.
39
I'm willing to bet that's because you're not using Mercury.

41

43

44
Banking services provided by Choice Financial Group, Column NA, and Evolve Bank and Trust, members of FDIC.
45
You have now arrived at your destination.
46
Guys, I'm so excited for this.
47, I love this time more than any other in the week.
48
I want to start with IPOs.
49
We were talking about it just before.
50
It is the most important topic for us to discuss.
51
And so, I want to start with Circles, the strongest IPO since 2020, and bluntly, much-needed positivity for the ecosystem in terms of public market response.
52
How did we analyze the response and Circle being so well received?
53
It's such a super interesting transaction in the sense that we've gone from, oh, IPOs are hard, nothing's happening, all the way straight through the oh my god, we left so much money on the table period without the intervening period of gratitude for the IPO.
54, literally, we went from the window was shut four weeks ago to the window is open, yay, yes, to oh my god, we underpriced this thing.
55
And in the case of Circle,, the data says,, they filed, they raised the range, and then it opened.
56, I think it's almost 2x plus the opening price.
57
So, first of all, great success, amazing.
58
It was a good company at the IPO price.
59
It's an amazing outcome at the current price, even if it's not sustainable.
60
Couldn't be happier for all involved.
61
I think the interesting question will then become: the underpricing issue will be even more acute here than normal.
62
Because normally, when you have these IPOs and there's a planned 15% pop, and instead there's a 40% pop, everyone's niffed.
63
But,, the money goes to the company, so you have 100 million less than you thought you would.
64
In this case, over half of the IPO was sellers, which means you just opted to sell a security at, I can't remember, I think it was 31 bucks a share, and two days later, it's trading at 80 bucks a share.
65
That's a lot of money to leave on the table.
66
So I'm sure if you chose to sell in the IPO, you're sitting back and going, hmm, I feel amazing about the outcome, but oh my God, that's a lot of money on the table.
67 20 million shares, I think, were secondary.
68
And what, 50, 60 bucks of extra dollars a share.
69
That's a billion dollars that went to the buyers, not the sellers.
70
So that's a fun one.
71
All the last IPOs except for SalePoint are up materially.
72
And the last, on average, they're up 76.8%.
73
Averages are confusing and misleading.
74
But I thought it was interesting that Mountain Hinge Health and I guess eToro, which I know less about, those are not high-hype stocks.
75
And those are up substantially.
76
It's just Circle and Core Weave are the crazy ones.
77
And I think they're at the edge of meme stocks.
78
Coreweave is an attempt to invest in AI, which is on file.
79
And Circle,, Rory and Harry, you may have more thoughts.
80
It's an attempt to invest in crypto when it's an exciting company, but it has so much interest rate sensitivity.
81
I think these are meme stocks.
82
And I don't know what Bill Gurley thinks about meme stocks, but I suspect at the start of a run of IPOs, you have to be careful on the meme stocks.
83
And toward the end of the bull run, you price the hell out of them.
84
Just, I don't know, maybe pedantic, is they're good companies that have meme value as well.
85, I think something GameStop was just a meme stock.
86
Both Core Weave and Circle are exceptionally good companies in big ass, meaningful industries.
87
But also, but also you're right, what they have is on top of that, that meme value, which makes pricing hard.
88
And I think it's a great point, Jason.
89
The other three companies that are just solid, boring companies,, doing great,, did exactly what they're meant to do, had that little 20% pop, trading nicely, everybody's happy.
90
These guys,, it really ran away from them.
91
And the fun thing is, you can say that, but the interesting question is, what can you do about those kinds of trades?
92
What do you do in those trades?
93
Because,,, Bill Gurley's been very vocal on, oh my God, you left all this money on the table.
94
How do you avoid giving up the pop?
95
Well, the first point is some pop is necessary.
96
And you have to start with that fact because these stocks haven't been traded.
97
You're asking people to step up and write a check.
98
And there's no prior pricing information.
99
So you got to get paid something for the volatility you're incurring,, the risk of a one-day loss.
100
So you start off in the IPO structure, unlike the direct listing structure, having to give some pop.
101
And then the judgment comes on: are you underestimating the real retail demand?
102
Are you underestimating institutional demand?
103
And are you leaving money on the table?
104
And obviously, in these cases where there's strong retail demand, you've ended up leaving a lot of money on the table.
105
The fun question, and this is right down in the weeds, is the bankers will say, and it's very zany, they'll say, if we didn't take these anchor investors at this lower price, the retail demand wouldn't be there.
106
And I've sat in the room and had those discussions.
107
And there's a little party that thinks that sounds plausible and correct.
108
And then there's another party who says, but that's it's a total violation of the efficient market hypothesis.
109
And I just don't believe it.
110
What happens in the end in these deals?
111
And, this is a concrete example of very intelligent investors leaving money on the table.
112
I think the biggest advantage the banker has is you do this once in your life or maybe if you're VC 10 times and a banker's doing it every week, and you have an informational asymmetry there.
113
And they're going to tell you, hey, at 31 bucks, you get fidelity and t-Row, but at 35, you only get a bunch of head funds, and they're going to slip it, and they're going to flip it.
114
So you opt for 31, and then the really frustrating thing is it pops to 70, and then Fidelity and T-Row flip it, and you feel you're a sucker.
115
But then you just go away back to your business, and they get onto the thing next week.
116
So it's a very problematic structure, but it's also worth pointing out the other alternatives don't work amazing.
117
If you step back,, at various times, I think folks, including Bill, SPACs have been a disaster.
118
Direct listing only works when you're an amazing company and you're not raising primary capital because of the regulations, which has not arguably not been the case here.
119
And then,, going back, there was a couple of companies that did those Dutch auctions, including Google, and they seemed to work, even though Google on the day was a little troubling because it, I remember, underperformed early on, but obviously amazingly since.
120
I think it's going to encourage everyone to go IPO, this strong performance.
121, QIIME, I saw in the media they were saying it's going to be a banger IPO because it's 10x oversubscribed, 10x.
122
In my limited experience, 10x isn't enough because those are soft commitments and people put in over-allocations to make sure they can get it.
123
And you really want to be 30x oversubscribed to pop hard.
124
I don't know if that's what you've seen on your public companies, but that's tough to get right at the start of an IPO market, how much that X needs to be, 10X, 20X, 30X.
125
You certainly don't want it to flop, right?
126
Yeah.
127
5X is not enough IPO.
128
All those 10X, 5X, 20X, oversubscribed, they're just so bogus because you've got this game theory thing of buyers are putting in bigger orders than they want because they don't think they're going to get cut back.
129
So the demand is entirely theoretical.
130
And the truth is, you have all these, the funny thing about every IPO is you have all these, what I call them, relationship bankers.
131
They know all about the business.
132
They know all about the story.
133
They've been calling on the company for three years.
134
They have a relationship with the CEO and the CEO, and none of it matters a damn the night before because you're sitting there, and then there's some person from equity capital markets that crawls out of the hole in New York and sits there and says, Here's the big long list, but this guy's lying, he won't flip, this guy will flip, sorry, he will flip, this guy won't flip, this guy doesn't really want 10 million, he only wants two, he's pretending to put in 10.
135
And the entire decision gets made by someone,, you spend a little time with, but not as much on the basis of things you don't quite understand.
136
It's a wildly frustrating process, which is why,, Bill Verley is right to be angry about it.
137
The hard thing is, what do you do better?
138
The very biggest, when Stripe finally goes public, they can do whatever they want.
139
They can do a direct listing and not raise any primary capital.
140
They could do the Google type auction, and no matter what, it'll all be fine.
141
But the median company, the typical company, is looking to raise primary capital, can't afford to get it wrong.
142
This is a one-time debut.
143
You probably aren't so strong that you could power through.
144, if no more than if Google had failed or Stripe were to fail, everyone would say it's not about Stripe, it's about the market was weird that week.
145
If your little $2 billion market cap company doesn't get done, your deal didn't get done.
146
So, you as the team, you're in an intrinsically weaker position.
147
So, you end up being discouraged from any innovative process.
148
And it's worth pointing out, most of the innovative processes, SPACs, fail anyway.
149
So, you're back to the time-honored build a book, raise $200 million of primary capital, deal with the informational asymmetry, do your best.
150
And then, some days, especially on the meme stops, you're randomly wrong.
151
It's a wildly flawed process to which we can find none better.
152
The question for me is: does this very positive response across the board with the IPOs that we've seen, not does it lead to the window opening more?
153
I think we all agree it does.
154
It's does it lead to the window opening to Databricks, to SpaceX?
155
And then we saw Figma confidentially file for IPO.
156
And I thought, maybe, how do we think about those two questions?
157
Which is, does it lead to the juggernauts?
158
And then what do we think about Figma?
159
The window is, was, and always has been open for Databricks and Stripe.
160
They just don't want to go through the window.
161
The windows open and shut for the $2 billion market cap IPO.
162
The window is always open for the $50 billion market cap IPO.
163
As someone said to me years ago, there's always room at the top.
164
Their decision not to go public is an entirely separate choice about what they think they can do privately versus public.
165, Figma is maybe the low end of really amazing Stripe, but the high end of more than amazing.
166
That to me is more of the normal.
167
The windows open companies, especially, I would say, especially if you nearly had a liquidity event two years ago, right, in terms of an MA sale, and obviously you lost that.
168
All credit to them for regrouping from that going forward and continuing to build.
169
It must have been a very difficult management challenge to pick yourself up having decided to sell to Adobe for 20 billion, not getting the deal done, having to,, getting some capital, doing a secondary at 10.
170
My guess is it totally makes sense for them to get a great IPO under their belt and not do the Stripe thing of stay private for another three or four years.
171
So I think that totally makes sense for them.
172
And if you nearly had the win and it was taken away from me right at the last minute, you're, this time I'm getting my freaking win, right?
173
I am posting the IPO.
174
I'm ringing the bell.
175
I'm declaring victory.
176
The only asterisk and dagger, I would add, is that these decisions, especially when you get a bunch of VCs and other large shareholders, they're trying to guess all of this.
177
And when everyone's caught up in feeling this is the time to IPO, I think people are going to try to go.
178
Even if they could have six months ago, even if this data shows, hey, Mountain Hinge, Circle, Core Weave, Toro, even SailPoint all could have IPO'd last year, right?
179
The window was open.
180
I just think when everything's trading up, every meeting starts to be about should we go public now.
181
And once everyone starts talking about it, you convince yourself and you start having those conversations.
182
Well, it's time.
183
It'll give us more rigor.
184
We'll get the biggest deal done.
185
And so when people are in the middle on the edge, they just go for it in this environment.
186
And I also your comment, Jason, about how,, the stuff just changes in months.
187,, you mentioned Core Weave, a wildly successful IPO.
188
Interesting.
189
That was one that reduced,, had to come down from the filing range.
190
In other words, as recently as four months ago, five months ago, the bankers tell you you were at X.
191
When it gets closer to the day and we find out what the end investors are willing to pay, you're reducing that range.
192
Fast forward four months later, it's 2X up from the IPO.
193
It just does, these high-go companies are hard to value.
194
Sentiment matters a lot.
195
Overall, market sentiment and specific sentiment about the deals.
196
And to some extent, the only way you find out is putting them out there and seeing what the demand is.
197
I think pretending you have this a priori knowledge of how these things are going to trade or when, quote, the window is going to open, you just have to internalize.
198
It's so random.
199
It's so outside your control.
200
You just have to build a company.
201
And once you're at the stage where you could go public and conceptually you think you want to go public, you should do all the preparations to get ready and then just accept the fact the timing to some extent is a bit out of your control.
202
When Core Weave did IPO and we were talking about it.
203
Not only did it, Rory, you've got the narrative.
204
Not only was it difficult to get done, they had to reduce the range.
205
We almost made fun of this existential risk they had with COATE, which was this clock ticking down on them, this debt they had to repay.
206
But because the IPO was so strong, they were able to raise $2 million of additional debt and completely de-risk the company.
207
So that existential risk is, for all intents and purposes, gone.
208
Maybe you don't need the money Stripe, but man, if you not only can you IPO in this market and trade up, but if then you can do things, de-risk the company even further Core Weave, that's a triple hat-trick they got, right?
209
They went from a company teetering on the edge of not being able to repay its debt to set for the better part of a decade.
210
Two comments is that.
211
One is, what it highlights, Jason, is the public markets in the United States are pretty damn amazing.
212, you can access large amounts of capital in short periods of time, which is why I believe the whole stay private, unless you're cash flow positive, if you're the company that needs to raise capital in the end at scale, the dominant and best and most cost-efficient way to raise capital is in the public markets of being public and with debt.
213
Core weave's proven that.
214
And then the other thing, just to put it out, it proves that how little, not to say I said anyone else knows, how little I know.
215, if we all had great opinions on Core Weave, there was a 2.5x on the table in four months.
216
You could have bought all the Core Weave your little heart desired, held it for two or three months, and be two and a half X up.
217
I didn't buy any.
218
What idiot am I?
219
Where we rank on the omniscience factor is probably a two or a three out of ten.
220
And just internalize that.
221
That's much easier than going from C to series A.
222
Rory, I'm going to tee you up on this one.
223
Okay.
224
I'm teeing you up so nicely.
225
We've had Deliveroo bought by the Americans, so taken off the London Stock Exchange.
226
And this week we had WISE, TransferWise, otherwise known, announce that they're going to also list on the U.S.
227
Bluntly, a pretty big fucking hammer blow to the London Stock Exchange.
228
Look, it would be fun to make this a ding on the Brits because I'm Irish and we always want an excuse to ding on the Brits, but it's not.
229
It's not about you being bad.
230
It's just about, again, going back to how freaking awesome the US capitalist system is.
231, the big, I was thinking the soundbite on this is the United States has 4% of the world's people.
232
We have roughly 23% of the world's GDP.
233
And depending on the day, we have 67% of the world's market cap and the stock exchange, right?
234
We won.
235
It's so funny.
236
U.S.
237
corporations are efficient.
238
They're highly valued.
239
They have international businesses.
240, not just our GDP, which is our income, is higher than our population ratio, but our wealth, our corporate sector, is even higher than our GDP.
241
When you look at those, so a couple of things from that, and probably two big conclusions.
242
One is about WISE.
243
But the first one to just put it out there is this is an amazing place to make money.
244
When you look at all the, oh my God, things are awful.
245
When you look at those numbers, whatever this system is, whatever this economic order is, it's been pretty damn good for America for 50 years.
246
Let me repeat: 4% of the population, 24% of the income, 67% of the wealth.
247
Yaos.
248
And then now to the WISE thing.
249
You're exactly right.
250
And you just look at that and you go, there's just way more people who want to buy my stock when it's listed in the States.
251
And it was interesting, when they announced that, the stock popped 8%.
252
That's basically saying you can make 8% free money just by listing in the U.S.
253
But fundamentally, if you want to list your stock in a market, you want to be trading on the biggest, most liquid market, and that's the United States.
254
Unless you have structural legal reasons Chinese companies where you can't be here, unless you're purely a domestic, maybe if you're just purely a domestic company, I don't think the NatWest or whichever bank survived the great crash over in England is going to list in the United States.
255
But for big public companies with an international business, why wouldn't you go where 70% of the cap is and just join the team?
256
Rory, I don't know if you've seen your public companies, but sometimes as lay folks, we overestimate how much liquidity there is for a lot of tech stocks.
257
All but the biggest ones are not, are some relatively thinly traded, right?
258
Relatively thinly traded, especially if you do a smaller IPO Mountain or Hinge, you might be surprised just how you're at the edge of liquidity.
259
So why wouldn't you,, I wouldn't want to do anything but the U.S.
260
if I was at the edge of that, right?
261
We overstate the liquidity that's out there.
262
That's a good point because I thought where you're going is, oh, it's not great, but you're exactly right.
263
If it's mediocre at the US, and it is softened at the two and three billion dollar level, you just don't have a chance anywhere else.
264
You're exactly right.
265
There's no analyst coverage.
266
The institutional buyers are not there in the single-digit billions, right?
267
You better be wherever there is any liquidity.
268
Should those companies be public, though?
269
Those two to five billion dollar companies where there's a very thin layer of liquidity, should they even be public?
270
I was with the founder of one of them last week and he was, no, we shouldn't be.
271
That's the point.
272
We shouldn't be public.
273
At some point, you're going to want to be because the liquidity in the private markets is even worse.
274
Now, yes, if you're amazing, you can access capital, right?
275
And there are some arguments for founders to say private.
276
But look, let's take another example.
277
As an employee, would you prefer to work for a company where your equity compensation can be earned over time, but can only be accessed once or twice a year to some extent with the approval of management, and depending on the specific markets on that day?
278
Would you prefer where your equity compensation is freely tradable every day of the year?
279
I think it's pretty obvious when you ask that question.
280
So, once you get to some scale, and the trade-offs are different for different kinds of companies, but in the end, successful big companies are in the main going to tend towards an IPO.
281
There's 1,500 unicorns today.
282
That's what Crunchbase says.
283
Close enough, right?
284
Rich Wong from Excel said this last week: 20% will fail.
285
Okay, so that leaves us with what, 1,200.
286
How many can do easily do tender offers of scale?
287
1%?
288
2%?
289, we've got 1,200 viable unicorns, many growing at abysmal rates, but, if they don't have a shot at a small IPO, how many of these companies are there?
290
15, 20 that can do these tender offers, right?
291
Jason, can I just understand something?
292
What does he mean by fail?
293
Fail to be a billion-dollar company?
294
Rich Wong, this Excel said 20% of unicorns this week will just fail.
295
They'll just gonna, and they're not gonna limp along, they're just going to fail of unicorns.
296
This is pretty rough and tough, but my gut would be it's roughly 20% will be good enough to get public in the end.
297
20% will totally, maybe 25 on each side, just for arbitrariness sake.
298
And then 50% in the middle are meaningful enough to be valuable, but not so meaningful that they'll get public and they'll be merged, they'll combine with someone else, they'll be PE'd.
299
But it's a distribution, it's probably a distribution, something that.
300
Maybe the low-end tail is not 20, maybe it's 30.
301
But I think broadly speaking, it's correct.
302
Some companies that were once worth a billion dollars can go to zero.
303
Easily done, especially if you have debt, especially if you have a high cost structure and if you're a sleep at Switch.
304
Many companies that were worth value north of a billion can flatten out and struggle to get five, six hundred million, but will realize some value.
305
And the percentage that will get public, my guess is it's 20% plus or minus, maybe even less.
306
So if it's 1,500,, it's still 300 IPOs.
307
That's a lot.
308
And it's only, this is the key point.
309
And it's only that last 10 or 20% who have, quote, IPO potential who could get a tender done.
310
And what that says, therefore, is so the consideration, the equity compensation for a lot of these companies is notional and not accessible.
311
One thing we're definitely seeing now is as the holding period goes on, there's not just the ability to do 10, there's a need to do tenders because you can't tell people sign up at 25 to join the startup.
312
It used to be work really crazy hours for four years.
313
We'll go public.
314
You'll ring the bell.
315
You'll get do really well as an employee.
316
It's amazing.
317
Now it's sign up for four years, that turns into 12 years.
318
And then at the end, we're still trying to put a tender offer together.
319
That's just less compelling.
320
And finally, people have lives.
321
They need to move on.
322
They need to buy houses.
323
They want to start families.
324
So the need to just get liquidity to solve employee comp problems just becomes acute.
325
And most can't do tender.
326
If you can do a tender, I think people are starting to do that.
327
But at some point, you're going to say to yourself, I'm doing tenders as well.
328
I'm not stripped where I can do them on demand.
329
Should I just ultimately access the public markets?
330
I'm increasingly impressed with the liquidity solutions that are off of private companies later stage, so I have to say.
331
Unless you're in the elite, that may fall apart next year.
332
It may not exist next year if they don't hit the growth targets, right?
333
There's always lots of liquidity these days around a financing event, right?
334
And there's often one more.
335
I don't know what you're seeing, Harry.
336
I think if your growth struggles, it instantly evaporates.
337, honestly, if I was a top-tier engineer or almost anyone that wanted to have the comfort of a later stage company, I might only join someone with a perfected tender offer program.
338, I wouldn't even bother for anything else.
339
That might be my first question in the interview.
340
How does your tender offer process work?
341, no, seriously.
342
Look, by definition, if you have more risk, you better have more return.
343
If there's two private companies and one of them is the small number of entities that have this monetizable stock and you don't have monetizable stock, there's a premium for liquidity.
344
And I think you'll see that in terms of what it takes to attract people, which is yet another reason, I know I'm sounding a broken record now, which is yet another reason why, as you get larger in scale, it's just going to be more efficient not to be even doing these tender offers and just going back to once you hit critical mass, wouldn't it be a lot easier to just go public?
345
Well, we're speaking of financing, obviously, there's going public, there's also later stage rounds and great, great companies raising later stage rounds.
346
We've discussed before the value of capital concentration going very, very long in your best companies.
347
I didn't realize, but specifically with regards to Angel's raising 2.5 billion Series G.
348
I don't know if you guys knew this.
349
They got a billion from Founders Fund in this latest round.
350
A billion again, making it their largest ever check.
351
And Founders Fund's prior largest ever check was also to Angel.
352
I didn't.
353, Sam Lesson said it was the only really important company he could think of more than OpenAI.
354
So I found it par, honestly.
355, in all seriousness, when I, after Sam's insights, I thought that hey, he's dude's right.
356
He said that and Allberds were the ones.
357
So it's probably joking, but honestly, my learning from that comment he made is it's probably an even better company than I realize.
358
It's the old world, just because you think someone's being a jerk doesn't mean they're not right.
359
You ask, How am I surprised?
360
No, I'm not surprised because all credit to Founders Fund, they told you to do this back in when they started the firm.
361
They said we're going to have highly concentrated bets in our best industries, the best companies, tick.
362
And they've also had, again, to be extraordinarily all credit to them, the theme of national security investing Thiel co-founded Palantir in I think 2003 2004 it's not they came Johnny come lately to this space and started doing it recently and are rushing in to catch up late stage.
363
They've had this thesis for 20 years.
364
They founded the company and they've said very clearly we're going to double down and treble down on our biggest bets.
365
Overlay on top of that, there's clearly not just a purpose in terms of capital, but there's clearly a felt purpose in terms of national security that animates the principles in that fund.
366
And I respect that.
367
I really do.
368
When you put all that together and you're also, let's be honest, at the Maslov hierarchy stage where minimizing risk for your investors is not your one, two, three, or four priority, you probably sit there and say, what do I want to do with my life?
369
I want to give as much money as I can to the company I love the most that's doing the cause I believe in the most, which is defending the Western world.
370, right back to,, and then you cite your Lords of the Ring and you're done.
371, they're putting a billion in, right?
372
That's much more ambitious than throwing a growth fund, throwing 50 million into the last round of Anthropic, right?
373
Or throwing 20 million into London.
374
It's just a big bet.
375, yeah.
376
Rory, what percentage capital concentration would be the peak of what you would be comfortable with in a fund?
377
We have a capital concentration limit of 10%.
378
We typically aim to five,, our typical expectation is 20 deals on an average of five, fairly lower standard deviation.
379
So I'd guess seven.
380
Do you think that's an interesting thing to me before they've done that?
381
And I've got to answer exactly that question.
382
I think we typically haven't done a whole ton of later stage follow-on, even in our best investments.
383
Our focus has been early dollars at work, maximizing multiple.
384
Ironically, this is a really weird comment.
385
The bigger the fund you raise, the more late stage you're going by definition.
386
And oddly enough, the more concentrated you have to make the bets, which is counterintuitive because there's lots of things that value at 100 million that might go to a billion.
387
There's very few things that are 10 billion that might go to 30.
388
So when you find one, you got to put a lot in.
389
At the stage we play at, it hasn't been necessary to have the level of concentration.
390
Our limits have been more than fine.
391
We've been in that 5% to 10% range.
392
I think to do what, again, to be fair to them, Founders Fund said 20 years ago they're going to do and have done, you have to have a much higher ability to concentrate to put that one, two billion to work in late stage.
393
It's not been our business, but I think the people who are doing it are doing it right.
394, if they put a billion dollars into Andrew and they really believe it can be worth $100 billion, the partners themselves just make a billion dollars off that one bet.
395
This is an incremental check, but that extra billion, if that goes from 13 to 100 and they keep 20, the partners clear a billion dollars personally off a one-day decision.
396
Honestly, I think the most interesting question to ask managers today is: what would you do if your LPs would let you do anything?
397
I fundamentally think,, if you have a 400 million fund, you put it in OpenAI, Anthropic, Cursor, and Andrew.
398
And I totally agree with you that.
399
Lockheed Marsh is $150 billion market cap.
400
Doing this at $40, you can see a 3.5x in this being the next generation of Lockheed.
401
I think the truth, it's an interesting question.
402
What would you do if you could do anything?
403
I think the probable answer would be just if you told your teenage kids they could do anything, someone who would do amazing, but a lot of them will go off the rails.
404
And the question as a parent is: would you want to sign up for that?
405
Right?
406
You are such a smart strategist of venture.
407
What would you do?
408
You are.
409
You are.
410
I interview so many.
411
What would you do if your LPs would let you do anything?
412
I found this job hard when I started, and it's hard to be good at one thing.
413
And I would say I probably have a conservative bias to keep doing what we're doing and doing it well versus trying to do lots of different things.
414
And I think the more you spread, you widen your aperture, yes, the more upside you have, but the more risk you take on.
415
Probably, I absolutely am.
416
Probably more risk averse at the margin and being willing to sign up for trying to do everything versus sticking to a strategy that works.
417
It's the buffer thing is,, know what's in the box that you can do and understand the limit of the box.
418
We do a really nice job on every dimension of seeing these early in revenue enterprise software companies looking to scale, investing in them, A's, B's, and sometimes C's.
419
I think trying to go for that, especially as a firm and trying to do, and now I'm going to put $100 and $200 million into something else.
420
It's just harder to do.
421
It's not a constraint from the LP as much as it's harder to do.
422
That said, I do believe, as I reflect back, I do believe a little more standard deviation in your bet sizing probably for the market we're in now might be appropriate.
423
I'm wrestling with that and thinking about that is you don't want to go hogwild.
424
You don't want to lose your discipline.
425
You don't want to deliver the product and the consistency you are.
426
But at the same time, if the market has moved, if staying private for longer has consequences, you got to think about what does that mean for your bet concentration.
427
So,, the bizarre thing about Founders Fund is they appear to be brilliant at everything.
428
And I give them all credit.
429
I just have to say, I'm not sure I could be that brilliant.
430, you have to go back to, wow, they've demonstrated a range of investment acumen across a range of different challenges.
431
That's just very impressive.
432
Back to your hypothetical LP question.
433
If everyone was set free to do whatever they want, I think for the median firm, it would be value-destructive.
434
I'll tell you what my answer is for what it's worth.
435
Just think when I thought about it, if I could do what I wanted and offset the risk, right, into other vehicles, into SBVs, into the Ether, then I get that the Andorrol open AI thing is the smartest play.
436
But what I personally would do would be to do every dollar up to a billion.
437
That would be my version of it in every winner.
438
So if you do a seed investment and it turns out to be a winner, top 5% deal, you do every round, A, B, C, D, E until a billion, and then you stop.
439
You buy, you maximize the ownership and you maximize the capital into a billion.
440
If I could offset the risk in those later checks, that the returns might be mediocre if the world didn't go perfectly.
441
That's what I would do.
442
I would do.
443
And I'm watching that currently in my little portfolio, the two hottest companies that I put hot in quotes.
444
That's what investors on the cap table with access to unlimited capital are based wildly oversubscribed because they're trying to just put every single dollar into every single round because they have access to, for all intents and purposes, unlimited capital relative to the startup's ability to consume it, right?
445
Why not instead of putting 5 million or 7 million in, why not put 100 in on the way to a million or 150, but still have the benefits of starting with a seed fund?
446
Maybe you have three funds, right?
447
And you stack them.
448, here you have two.
449
But that's what I would find a way to do that if I didn't have to worry about some of the risk of doing it.
450
The interesting thing about the hypothesis, the oh, I double down on my winners all the way, is it sounds plausible, but it's interesting when you run the math.
451
There's not as big an opportunity to stuff money in even most late-stage quote-unquote winners as you'd think, right?
452
Because if you think about,, as I said, going back to our likely distribution, we do 20 deals, 30% of them fail.
453
You don't want to put a dime in those.
454
50% of them are a one to five X on the money you put in, which means by definition, the next round, the 2x that is a 2.5x or less.
455
Not a compelling.
456
Only 20% of deals in any fund, if you're doing A's and B's, are going to be amazing.
457
So now you're down to only four deals out of the 20 where you can, quote, stuff money into.
458
And remember, amazing is a 10x.
459
But still, four.
460
Four is not zero.
461
It's four is a four.
462
That could be $400 million right there.
463
It's still four, but yes, it could be, but what was amazing to you at the A and the B mightn't be amazing on that last round.
464
So probably of that four, let's say the four of them are 10x plus type returns from the A and B prices.
465
By definition, from the C and D prices, they're going to be three and four X returns.
466
It's only if you have the one or two amazing compounding winners that you can stuff big money.
467
When you raise that quote late stage opportunity fund, one of a couple of things happen.
468
Either A, you right-size it such as a relatively small percentage of your core fund, because there's not that many opportunities.
469
The second thing that happens, but people don't do that.
470
The second thing you do is, I don't have enough money in my portfolio.
471
I'm just now going to do general growth investing.
472
I'm just going to find other deals that do it.
473
Or the third is, and I think people who are doing are doing well, you just ratchet up the end count, the number of deals at the series A and B, because you're basically saying to make my math on my overall thing work, I need to have not just a really good one to $5 billion outcome, but a freaking amazing $5 plus billion dollar outcome.
474
And the only way to do that, you can say you can do it with great picking, but we've discussed that over and over again.
475
You can, but it's maybe at most one per fund.
476
But if you treble the number of at-bats, then you probably roughly two and a half X the chance of being able to move big money at the late stage.
477
The point I'm making is this: there's a whole series of things you're driven to do once you adopt this.
478
Oh, I'm going to quote stuff a load of money into my late stage deals.
479
It's not as simple.
480
The sound bite always looked good in retrospect.
481
Look, if I knew DocuSign was going to compound to where it did, I would have done the round at 19 bucks a share too.
482
I didn't.
483
We did the round at a buck and two bucks.
484
But those outcomes are few and far between.
485
And the amount of distortion you get to try and it's really hard to pull that strategy off in the quote-unquote typical portfolio.
486
When you reflect, Rory, on that, could you have known?
487
Is there a lesson that you take from that?
488
I did it at a buck.
489
I did it at two bucks.
490
And it's now at 19.
491
It's now at 80.
492
And I passed, and I didn't do a lot of the round at 19.
493
Is there a lesson you could know?
494
It's always the lesson on the good outcomes that you could have done more.
495
And the only way you can be intellectually honest is think, what other deals did I have that looked equally promising that in retrospect you shouldn't have done the round at 19?
496
Everyone does this.
497
In retrospect, I wish I put more money in my winners.
498
Duh, right?
499
It's not an insight.
500
It's an obvious.
501
The question is: can you put enough money in your winners to move the needle without putting enough money in your so-sos to drag down your return?
502
And that's a challenge.
503
There's five or seven amazing companies in the last decade.
504
We know the names, right?
505
If you end up with one of those, you probably can stuff to your heart's content.
506
Chime being a good example.
507
It looked something you could stuff to your heart's content, but it turned out that the price wasn't 25, it was 12, 15-ish, and stuffing didn't work.
508
The DocuSign and even the EchoSign Adobe Sign lesson, looking back, having been there, right?
509
I think the venture lesson be visionary, but relentlessly honest about TAM because it's a TAM story at the end of the day.
510
If you have a number one or number two player in the space and you see a TAM explosion happening, that's where you get a big lift, right?
511
It's hard to know which ones are going to be your best and how much they're going to run.
512
I also think there's probably been a little bit of a fake signal in 21 because even your okay ones got highly valued.
513
Late stage looked a lot easier in 21 than it probably will look across a decade.
514
With my first fund after 18 months, I predicted my top five fund returners.
515
You had your Hoppins, you had your B-Reels, you had your Clubhouse.
516
And none of the five outperformers ended up being the outperformers.
517
And the five outperformers, I always had in the middle bucket,.
518
They were always in the mid-tier.
519
And, it was Roger Aaronberg at IA who said that is exactly the same as me.
520
And I see exactly that in our portfolios.
521
It's an interesting fact because we have a different experience because we're just slightly there.
522
I think at seed, that's totally true.
523
At seed, you almost know nothing.
524
At the A and B stage, what we've observed is this.
525
The going in probability of a 5X plus winner, our mental model, remember I said it's 30, yeah, 20% chance of that outcome.
526
If after two years, the company has done what we said it would do roughly in terms of performance, in other words, it's ramped, the probability of it being a 5X plus outcome goes up to around 60 or 70%.
527
And it's just because we're slightly late at stage.
528
We're paying for companies after they have product market fit and are looking to scale.
529
And if in fact they scale, your probability of a strong outcome goes up a lot.
530
And if they don't scale, it's obviously a lot harder.
531
So our data comes back quicker than yours because it's a little further along.
532
But it's still what we remain uncertain of.
533
At seed, you're, does it even work?
534
At the stage we're at, is it a decent business that can grow fast?
535
And then the late stage question is, how big can this be?
536
Which is a TAM question, as Jason pointed out.
537
And how will it be ultimately valued by the public markets?
538
That's the thing that,, two or three years in, we don't know.
539
And if you're looking for everyone, as we're all on the same journey at different stages, you can be good at the thing you have, but then you internalize at the outer edges, there's the things that just aren't knowable as easily, even when you're in the deal.
540
I think an important point that you've pushed back on me before, Honori, you said,, oh, I'd still take these companies, but how fast can you grow?
541
And the financing providers find that rate still attractive.
542
You've said before the double, double, treble, treble.
543
But,, I met a company in Vertical SaaS the other day.
544
I was talking to Jason about it.
545
They'll scale to from 1 million to 7 million over the next three years.
546
It's not attractive.
547
No one's going to touch that.
548
I would change that word because you're beginning to sound our recent friend.
549
It is attractive for them.
550
And that's the most important thing.
551
It's a great entrepreneurial opportunity.
552
It's just not compelling for our business model.
553
And I think it's an important thing.
554
I was reflecting on the conversation last week.
555
You never want to diss down the entrepreneur.
556
Most businesses aren't venture fundable.
557
To the conversation last week, most venture fundable deals don't turn out to be the most important company of the last decade because by definition, only one company can be the most important company of the last decade.
558
That doesn't mean you piss on the entrepreneur on the journey.
559
I love the fact that this company that's going from one to seven over three years, great for him.
560
He probably has a great business.
561
It's just not our business.
562
That's all.
563
I would respectfully push back and say, I'm not pissing on the entrepreneur.
564
I'm saying if you take money with that growth rate, I think there will be an impatience from your venture investment that will make your life hard.
565
And for that time, I want to save you a great pain.
566
And that's why I would say, I'm just going to push it in and let Jason.
567
I think if you said that's not attractive for us, that would have been a fine statement, right?
568
I think not, again, it's back to Mr.
569
Cloud.
570
That's no good, isn't a helpful thing.
571
It's, that's a really good business for you, but it would not be a good business for us as venture people.
572
That way, you're not downing their journey, but at the same time, you're saying it doesn't suit our model.
573
It's not,, it's not you, it's me.
574
Agree.
575
Sorry, Jason.
576
But I might do that deal, Harry, for what it's worth.
577
If I thought the founders were incredible, I thought the true TAM was large, and I thought there was upside at growth scale at beyond 10 million.
578
And I hate over-discussing price, but in this case, if the price was commensurate with that bet, which was much easier to do a few years ago, I would take that bet.
579 in the older days, I did that bet in Pipe Drive, okay?
580
And that was, and I did it at 16 million, right?
581
And it's not that it's the same, but it's basically the similar metrics at the time.
582
I would do that bet at 16 pre or 20 post.
583 if I love the founders and believe the market was large enough, I might take that risk at 20 post.
584
It's just they don't want to do it.
585
That world doesn't exist today.
586
But I might take that, honestly, I might take that risk.
587
How he's got his skeptical faith on.
588
I share his skepticism.
589
I'm just saying, literally, I would say it.
590
So you could be skeptical.
591
I'm saying, honestly, based on what I know that deal, we talked about it, right?
592
It's interesting to me if this is a multi-billion dollar opportunity and it's just going to take a little longer and it's still going to double at that rate.
593
And I love the founders, founders matter.
594
And I might take that bet if the valuation gave me time.
595
I'm patient if it gave me time.
596
That's fair, but implicit in that statement is you're basically what you're saying, it's quite an interesting thing in the context of what you're saying is the near-end traction to seven over three years, you're saying may not be predictive of the ultimate potential.
597
Because you just did a great report on it.
598
I wrote it up.
599
They just did one the other day that velocity to 100 is not, it's why, is not the perfect predictor to success at scale.
600
You just need to grow fast.
601
Didn't that what the Open View report said?
602
It said you just have to grow fast enough to 100 to get there, but the super fast historically pre-AI hasn't fully correlated to success.
603
We've looked at every deal we've done.
604
This is a really interesting one.
605
And we ranked it based on the quartile of growth rate relative to the peers at the time of investment.
606
So first, second, third, or fourth quartile.
607
Now, as you'd expect, literally at the time of investment, we've done almost no deals below the second quartile.
608
Because obviously, we'd be incredibly stupid to do deals that were slow growing out of the gate.
609
But the interesting fact is this: very little correlation between great outcomes being top quartile or second quartile.
610
In other words, they're almost as likely, they're growing quickly, but not astonishingly quickly, has just about the same probability of giving you a great outcome as the hyper growth from day one, which is, I think, validation of what you're saying, Jason.
611
Bill.com, it compounded to a huge network and obviously it was an amazing outcome for us.
612
But the growth rate was always, I think, second quartile, right?
613
There were companies always growing back in the day with Renee.
614
It was slower growing than it was.
615
Whenever I would see him, it was always growing a little slower than I was.
616
When we did that work, I was really happy because what it shows is it's not just a metrics business.
617
And I think,, because I tend intellectually to be quantified, it was really good pushback from my own brain to say, Rory, it's not about rank them all and do the highest growth thing based on the growth rate at a time of investment.
618
It turns out that that would be a very bad rule because it would exclude some amazing deals.
619
My aha is you want to be a top half growth rate, but then after that, you have to take into account things other than just the absolute.
620
You can't, as I say, you can't just rank them and buy.
621
It turns out there's nuance within that.
622
Capital efficiency matters, TAM market, entrepreneur, growth persistence, all the other things.
623
A friend of mine years ago had this wonderful saying about venture when you'd complain about how hard it is to figure all this shit out.
624
And he would say to me, if it was factory work, they'd pay you factory wages.
625
In other words, if it was simple, they'd pay you 20 bucks an hour and they don't.
626
It's not as simple as rank on growth rate and buy from top down.
627
When we did the work, it was pleasing.
628
I think Hugspot was for a couple of quarters.
629
Why does we invest in only second quartile?
630
And it's been an amazing outcome.
631
Absolutely has.
632
Speaking of growth rates, I do want to get to an important topic, I think,, which is a piece of work done by Jamin Bull that we've seen this real slowdown in SaaS spending for H125.
633
The question being, is this an ongoing, more permanent trend?
634
Is this a H at a time and we will progress through it?
635
How do we think about this in context of where we are today in terms of this SaaS slowdown in spend?
636
But yeah, this was tough news to see that the rate of growth has declined more this year.
637
There can be different reasons.
638
I look, I wonder why Okta has slowed.
639
It's still two products, why Salesforce is still in the single digits.
640
It's so big.
641
But I do worry that the pressure of AI sucking up all the spend.
642
Another person pointed out on Twitter, I've added to my summary of it, if Cursor did almost half a billion dollars in revenue in the same time, it sucked up an enormous amount of that dollar that would have gone to Okta and Salesforce, right?
643
500 million.
644
That's a lot in that period of time, right?
645
So AI is sucking up budget.
646
Here's a real example of it happening and consolidation is still coming.
647
It's still coming.
648
So I just think this pressure, it's just, it's just this pressure is not, even if the 20, 24 days are behind us, it doesn't appear to be any easier.
649
Big picture.
650
I do think the slowdown continues, even though we don't talk about it as much.
651
If you zoom out, and we had said this literally four or five years ago, this is not surprising.
652
The industry's mature.
653
And if you think about it, about five or six years ago, there was a narrative of, oh my gosh, it's been 20 years of SaaS in cloud, and we're only 40% of workloads have moved to the cloud.
654
And people would articulate that as if it was good news.
655
And I remember a time thinking and saying, you idiot, it's horrific news.
656
Do why?
657
Because you've compounded from 1% market share to 40% market share.
658
It took 20 years and an average growth rate of 30%.
659
Do the math.
660
That gets you roughly there.
661
The problem is three more years of 30% growth and you go from 40 to about 80.
662
The SaaS slowdown was inevitable once you got to 40, 50% market share.
663
These are mature served markets.
664
The best example of that is, let's take a Zoom, a company I love and so wish I'd done.
665
Who the hell do you think is left in 2023 who doesn't have a freaking Zoom account?
666
You're done.
667,, if you didn't buy one in 21, there's,, you've hit TAM.
668
You've hit complete TAM, right?
669
And that's an extreme example, but I think DocuSign wrestled with some of the similar things, right?
670
Salesforce, most companies have a CRM.
671, I know they'll show you some survey that says on a TAM basis, there's other companies.
672
But the truth is, you've had 20 years to buy the damn thing.
673
It hasn't changed.
674
If you haven't bought it now, you are a trailing edge adopter.
675
Independent of AI, the SaaS industry was going to hit the mature stage.
676
And you're right, Jason, it's all the things that happen at that stage.
677
Bundling, consolidation, grinding out the weak.
678
Fortunately for us as technology investors, right at the same time, you got this new new thing, which is sucking up all the attention and the dollars, and it's taking a lot of the attention and definitely contributing to the slowdown.
679
Now, the good news is it's not quite zero-sum.
680
This is the key hope statement.
681
If you're just replacing CRM with, let's call it AI CRM, then there's no TAM expansion, then it really is a knife fight for limited resources.
682
If, in fact, the AI is taking over some of the work and taking over some of the labor dollars, then to some extent it's additive, which is obviously what we believe it is.
683
But that's the crucial statement.
684, I don't think it's a fight for table scraps.
685
I think AI is the new, new thing.
686
And to some extent, from an economic perspective, the cursor dollars in software development or any other of these things aren't directly taking away from the SaaS dollars.
687
I think it's TAM expansion, but at the just practical level of getting shit done, my guess is a CIO, people can only take on so many projects.
688
There's no brownie points for taking on a SaaS conversion in 2025.
689
There's a lot of brownie points for doing something in AI.
690
The attention has shifted.
691
The SaaS business is definitely in the consolidation stage, and the AI business is exploding.
692
Almost too much of that.
693
I overloaded that.
694
No, it's great.
695
You can't argue.
696
The 40% math is a good one.
697
You can't argue with that, right?
698, if you don't dramatically expand the dollars going into traditional business offering, you just can't compound at the rate the markets want.
699
It's just not possible.
700
Yeah, I agree.
701
I think that part was clear.
702
I think on the AI stuff, it's a question of unlocking new dollars and expressing that clearly.
703
There's so much groupthink on social media.
704
I think, I want to believe, I want to believe, but I think the evidence that AI will unlock massive budget from the human side of replacing humans from the services budget, there's some evidence of it, but I don't think it's a slam dunk today when we're doing this today.
705
I don't think it's a slam dunk that the TAM will overall for B2B will go 5X because we'll attach from other human budgets and replace it with AI.
706
I don't know that we've proven that.
707
It makes sense, but I don't think we have as much evidence of it as we claim on social media.
708
You've been more apocalyptic in the past, so I'm glad to hear that because I think the evidence it's classic thing is the future is here, it's just unevenly distributed.
709
In some areas, you are seeing the unlock and you are seeing the automation, but one of the reasons I'm pretty relaxed about any all these mass unemployment stories, I think it's a long secular 20-year trend that we can invest in.
710
And I think you will see replacement of labor by AI on a pretty consistent basis, but not an explosive basis.
711
And it's a great investment theme.
712
It is happening very quickly in the contact center at the extreme, right?
713
I'm just worried from going to your point of the TAM, because I have a lot of exposure to the contact center.
714
Half the folks are being displaced to these companies, but you're not getting that much more ACV.
715
That's my worry.
716
You're replacing a $40,000, $50,000 a year human, $60,000 a year, fully burdened with benefits and taxes, not with a $20,000 a year bill, with a $20 a month bill.
717
That's the issue.
718
I don't know that there's enough TAM appreciation when you trade in a $50,000 human for $240 a year.
719
If that's what's happening, then you're right, but I don't.
720
It is happening.
721
I think I can just tell you, I just look at my portfolio.
722
When I look at Gorgeous, which is which dominates Shopify for the contact center, right?
723
Their average customers replaced 40 to 50% of their humans with AI, and their ACV is only up 50%.
724
It's only up 50% with half their humans replaced with AI, right?
725
So, how much you could help me think about intellectually, but how much does that really expand the TAM?
726, if it's only 50%, that's not enough for your compounding math to be exciting, is it?
727
If what you're saying is correct, it wouldn't be.
728
But I wonder on each of the dimensions.
729, my funny enough, I've just been doing some refresh work on the, as you say, the call center, contact center space.
730
And interestingly, you come up with roughly the same rules of thumb that I see in robotics, a totally different space, which is people tend to replace labor when there's a two-for-one arbitrage.
731
In other words, when we're selling robotics, and I've seen this over and over again, you go in and you say you're spending $100,000 on labor.
732
If on a RAS robot as a service basis, we can do it for $50,000.
733
Less than that, it's not worth the brain debt.
734
But you typically can get that.
735
You can have the market, and you can get that.
736
In call center, for example, email and call resolution is a two to four dollar email human resolution-based process.
737
We are seeing companies getting plus or minus a dollar.
738
So I do think you can get that.
739
You get half the labor you save to you.
740
So by definition, if you're only saving a little bit of labor, you're not going to get enough to uplift.
741
But zooming out, the contact center software market is $10 to $15 billion a year of annual spend.
742
The contract center labor market is at least $150 billion.
743
So now I'm going to arm wave just for a second and you can give me shit.
744
So you can look at that and go, oh my God, it's $75 billion if you do the two-for-one rule.
745
So it expands from a $15 billion to a $75 billion market if you can, quote, eat the labor.
746
I don't think you can eat all the labor by any means, but I do believe there is going to be at least a 2X TAM expansion, 3X TAM expansion, as you take the simple contact center queries and resolve them on a two-to-one basis for half the price using AI and the AI company will be able to take that capital, take that money.
747
So I do think there'll be time expansion.
748
I don't think it will be all, it's not going to eat the whole contact center market.
749
There's going to be humans on phones and answering emails for the foreseeable future, but automation to be done and TAM expansion to be gained.
750
If you're pricing it so low that you're giving it just at the margin to your existing stuff, then yeah, that's going to be hard.
751
I think the value is there such that you can command more.
752
I'll give you two other quick thoughts for it, Worthin.
753
One, a lot of the folks that are exploding in the AI context center with huge numbers have either acquired or indirectly acquired BPOs attaching into that $75 billion in a very interesting way.
754
Not all that revenue is necessarily software, SaaS, or AI.
755
I'm not saying it's sketchy, but it might be the, some leaders might be at the edge of slightly sketchy.
756
But I'll give you an example.
757 I look at what's, maybe that's going to happen.
758
The one I'm watching, I'm just curious.
759
I don't have the answers.
760
Is I'm a huge proponent of AI replacing sales reps, right?
761
Everyone out there in the market selling these products is basically trying to sell a 30 to 50 to 60K price point and up.
762
When we get really good at it, it might be 20 bucks a month.
763
It might be 20 bucks a month.
764
It wouldn't surprise me if when the cursor for sales comes out for real, it's not a bunch of traditional sales processes trying to charge 50 grand.
765
It's, this is just software.
766
This is just, this is a really good wrapper, and it's 30 bucks a month.
767
I don't just don't know that we're going to be able to, that all these price points that we hope are sustainable in venture and startups, I don't, I'm not sure when the underlying COGS approaches zero, if it's going to be as sustainable as we hope, this one for two.
768
I hope it is, but that's my concern for the TAM.
769
On the software side, it's just SAS.
770
At some level, you go in 1999, duh, this is it.
771
Everyone was going to do SaaS.
772
It was obviously the wave of the future.
773
And no one founded another non-SaaS client-server company.
774
At the same time, it took 20 years to get everyone across from non-SaaS to SaaS.
775
And the sequencing became really important.
776
And it wasn't just random.
777
It turns out the things that had the highest value from that shift, CRM, went first, and the things that a lower value, accounting, took longer.
778
And I think it'll be exactly the same here.
779
It's not going to be a cataclosmic change in one day.
780
I think you have to pick the spots where it works now and avoid the spots where it's going to take five more years.
781
My mental model is there's a two-step process.
782
Step one is: does the AI work and allow automation?
783
You over that hurdle.
784
And you're right.
785
The second question is: can you get paid for that enough?
786
And I can't speak to the specifics of your company.
787
I do believe, I think it's hard, interesting comment, it's harder to command huge value on top of software on the SMB side, because typically the amount of labor you're saving is not a lot.
788
The wonderful thing about automation for large corporate America is when you have 2,000 people in a contact center and you're paying them each 50 grand a year, the quantum of money gets big enough that the quantum of saving from automation becomes compelling.
789
I do think that for those things, you will, for those higher-end implementations, you will be able to command value from what you're delivering with AI.
790
AI, next generation AI for B2B, as you approach true SMB, it's more and more going to be base and included with a limited upsell opportunity.
791
In the enterprise, we're going to try to do Agent Force and charge massive amounts of money, and we'll see where this all leads.
792
But when the AI, when an S-tier AI is included for free in an SMB product, and when it's charged $20,000 a year to replace one human in the enterprise, we'll see how that works out over the coming years.
793
Instead of looking at the SMB products that are crummy compared to the enterprise ones, we may again be looking at them in AI and saying, wow, they're better.
794
Look what I get for free included with my SMB CRM.
795
It's included for free.
796
Final one, guys, before we do a quick fire.
797
I was in Sweden at this dinner.
798
Elon's tweet came out, and we're not going into politics, so it's not a political question.
799
But Elon's tweet came out, and I think half the people around the table had over $100 million in SpaceX and probably another $100 million in other Elon companies.
800
Purely from the business perspective, again, I'm not going into politics.
801
I'm not going into health or drug use, nothing.
802
How do we evaluate Elon companies from here?
803
Is it business as usual?
804
How do we think about that?
805
It was never going to work.
806
So you probably just got through that pain point.
807
It's pretty clear from a company building perspective, most investors would have preferred to skip the whole thing.
808
If you'd stayed on the sidelines, making nice, kind, supportive noises, but without putting your head up the powerpoint, you would have probably got all the benefits that the market was attributed.
809
Reminder, as late as December, January, there was the, oh my God, it's going to be amazing for Tesla trade going on in the market, and the stock went way up.
810
If you'd stayed less involved in doing what he did as visibly as he did, you probably could have got the benefits without the pain.
811
Always worth nothing.
812
Again, you go back to the shrewdness of Peter Thiel at Founders Fund, got some of the benefits of perceived support for the current administration, probably gets some of the halo effect from that without putting himself in the line of fire.
813
Elon, just because he is that entrepreneur who leads with his heart, did the other.
814
And the process of doing it and then withdrawing from it has been painful.
815
Given that it was always going to fail, thank God that's over is probably their feeling.
816
But it would have been so much better had none of it ever happened from a pure company perspective.
817
Is there a company that is more materially impacted than others, do you think, Roy?
818
Tesla, only because the truth is, electric vehicles have a whole bunch of specific subsidies, both around purchase and around the ability to resell emissions credits to people GM, right?
819
And all those things can be withdrawn by Congress.
820
There's no obvious direct political cost.
821
It's a much better statement of doing that.
822
And there's no obvious impact on the government.
823
I think the wonderful thing about Starlink and why it's an amazing business is you go through the, oh my God, I hate.
824, I can see the government sitting in a room going, we love you, Elon.
825
God, we'll give you a lot of business.
826
Then, oh, my God, we hate you, Elon.
827
But there's nothing we can do because we don't have any other rockets.
828
It's the definition of a great,, the definition of a great business is when your customers can hate you and still do business with you.
829
And I think,, the truth is, SpaceX, it's just such an amazing achievement that even if what was your largest customer, interesting, is now no longer your largest customer because Starlink is such a big business.
830
Even if one of your biggest customers doesn't much you, they still got to do business with you.
831
That's not quite as true for Tesla.
832
So, yeah, I think the impact is slightly worse there.
833
I think let's just give it a year.
834
As you point out, Harry, the news cycles are so fast, right?
835
Clearly, Elon's alienated himself.
836, Tesla's the closest to a consumer product of those until the and so he's alienated a certain segment of his population, which has impacted.
837
You saw it in Europe most extremely, right?
838
Some of the some of the sales.
839
But let's give it a year, I think.
840
We'll never forget this episode.
841, stock prices go up and down.
842
I, this may sound crazy, but I think in a year we will not have forgotten about it, but maybe no one cares.
843
I don't even know if Trump cares anymore.
844
So, I don't know if the rest of the world will care.
845
He may not even care.
846
Yeah.
847
And I'm just glad he's back to doing them.
848, because we mentioned Neuralink and the fundraiser here, you just got to go back to putting that episode behind.
849
What an amazing entrepreneur.
850
Reminder to the haters: Tesla, wow.
851
SpaceX, wow.
852
And then we forget it, but well, he won't forget it, by God.
853
OpenAI founding, wow.
854
And now, Neuralink, wow.
855, you just got to step back and say, please,, another one that everyone forgets: the boring company.
856, reinventing city infrastructure around the world.
857
Have you done it?
858
Have you done it?
859
It's pretty cool.
860
It just works.
861
It's pretty cool.
862
At least in Vegas, it doesn't do much, but what it does do is pretty cool.
863
And,, I think that,, I was just thinking about this this morning.
864
It's, it's such a shame.
865
And that's just such an unparalleled record of entrepreneurial success.
866
And it's a management failure of massive proportions, if you think about it, to hire the guy who did that for something that's not that.
867
It's something that's political, something that involves making cuts, something that involves making political decisions.
868
It's so good that he's back to doing the thing he's best at.
869
Everyone should play the position where they can score and win.
870
Regardless.
871
So, so that gets back to what I said earlier.
872
It's not that it's better, but it's just everyone's back now in their right place.
873
Elon is back building amazing companies.
874
Yay, everyone.
875
Oh, my god, that was a painful six months, is I'm sure the mental model.
876
Skills are not wholly transferable.
877
One of the beauties to X is we can see how what every billionaire thinks, right?
878
There's so many billionaires on X and tech, so we can see what they think.
879
The meta question I wonder is:, should you invest once a billionaire becomes unhappy?
880
Chamath seems unhappy, I don't know him.
881
Elon doesn't seem happy.
882
Can folks still be as innovative and groundbreaking when they reach the unhappy billionaire phase?
883
I don't know.
884
The one thing I will say on Shamath is the public persona and the private persona are drastically different.
885
He's very humble and kind privately.
886
The public is a very different display.
887
The only meta question just is: are your best days behind if you become the, let's leave Shamath out of it.
888
I don't really know, but my very limited interactions are consistent with that, Harry, for sure.
889
But I would say at least 50% of the tech billionaires on X are unhappy.
890
Can they still innovate at that stage?
891
Do they still have the same level of drive or passion?
892
Or is there crouchiness an inhibitor to be an innovator?
893
And I think that's the sentence here.
894
And I love what Harry said: you don't know if someone's happy till them personally.
895
The truth is, social media and politics just tend to drive a person.
896
It takes a certain persona to be perceived as winning.
897, we all understand The heightening effect in social media of the most extreme situations.
898
So I think it's one of those environments where, Gresham's law for money, bad money drives out good.
899
Well, the equivalent of that in social media is bad opinionated people drive out good, boring people.
900
So, when you're in the political arena, when you're in the social media arena, it just forces a persona that comes across at least that's very angry and unhappy.
901
And I'm, whatever.
902
I'm willing to suffer the risks of getting a billion dollars and seeing how I do.
903
And that's what's going to happen, but I'm willing to run that risk.
904
I want to do a quick fire.
905
This is Cauchy's Quick Fire again.
906
This is the performance marketplace where people bet on different outcomes.
907
So, let's start with number one.
908
Sundar Pitjai leaves Google this year.
909
Yes or no?
910
The only thing I thought about when I saw this, when I was a VP at Adobe and Shant New was the CEO, not a founder, but on the rise there, I didn't directly interact with the Adobe board or others.
911
But when I saw the vibe, they were not going to let that guy leave.
912
This was a company that it was no longer a founder-run, and he had figured out the transition to cloud.
913
And you could debate decisions, but his ability to steer that ship in the right direction, everyone at Senior Adobe knows, it was even riskier to have anybody else, right?
914
So I suspect it's similar at Google.
915
None of the large stakeholders want him to go no matter what, and they will do almost anything to keep him despite all the on the search side, which is still the majority of revenue, despite all the threats today.
916
That was my sense because Sean was just,, he's a great CEO, but I'm sure the board and others would just grab him by the jacket and not have left him ever leave Adobe when I was there, even,, for many, many years.
917
The question is really,, abstracting from personal stuff.
918
Random events could cause it.
919
There's some probability that anyone can leave at any point in time.
920
It's called death.
921
What is really a proxy for saying is, is he doing an amazing job at Google?
922
I think we've definitely gone from the, oh my God, the world is ending at Google to,, they're doing good stuff.
923
They're getting good models out there.
924
It's not obvious it's all gone to hell in a handbasket.
925
They have the classic innovators dilemma of the Google model, the search model is awesome.
926
It's a cash-spewing machine.
927
But let's be honest, when I get the lineup for the Howie Stebbings podcast, I start on ChatGPT to do my research, not Google anymore, right?
928
So they have that long-term dilemma.
929
It's not clear that putting someone else in the chair will solve that.
930
My guess is by far the most likely outcome is not leave, just continue to manage what you've got reasonably well without ever solving the existential problem.
931
I agree with you both.
932
The only thing that I do think is just interesting is Sergei is back and he's back.
933
And he's speaking publicly about being back and how it's the most exciting time ever and how they have to win more than ever, having had a hiatus.
934
And I'm just intrigued to see what that interplay is.
935, if it were to happen, that's been the default.
936, if you look at the founder comes back narrative is definitely, there are precedents, including obviously the most amazing one, and then the Starbucks guy who keeps coming back every three years, it or not.
937
Yeah, it would be the narrative that would easily sell.
938
My guess is if the founder decided he wanted to do that, it would be on the table.
939
But Caushi way agrees with us.
940
They say absolutely he will stay.
941
So if we go to the next one, New York Times wins open AI lawsuit.
942
This one's pretty evenly split.
943
Yes or no to New York Times wins open AI lawsuit?
944
If you include win or settle, then I'd give it 80%.
945
In other words, I can't believe that OpenAI is just going to want to let it run forever.
946
So if you lump settlement into the equation, do I think New York Times is going to come away with quote-unquote a win of sorts out of this?
947
Yes.
948
More likely to be a settlement, just because always in the end, close to the trial, people settle than a, oh my God, it goes all the way to, I don't know if it's a jury or a bench trial, and then they win.
949
But I think they've got enough of a case to be in the room.
950
And it's one of those issues where money ultimately can help solve it.
951
So, yes, I think they win something from suing.
952
I think they win more from suing and then settling than the other companies who did smaller media deals with OpenAI.
953
In other words, to make it harder for myself, their strategy of suing will be validated versus just cutting a $20 or $30 million deal with OpenAI two years ago.
954
I think they will get something from their effort.
955
If they've already determined that they're going to pay in the end, then that has to settle.
956
And in that sense, they'll win, but they may not win the lawsuit because it gets settled.
957, at some level, if they don't, it's going to go to the Supreme Court.
958
It has to go to the Supreme Court.
959
And the folks in the Supreme Court will decide what fair use means in the age of the internet.
960
And that's a big, that's probably a 48% gamble because it's easy to see them coming down on the side of the content providers.
961
And maybe Sastro gets a check.
962
I think I deserve a check.
963
Chat GPT scrapes a lot of our content.
964
I get a lot of traffic from it already.
965
Seriously, why don't I get a check?
966
Why does New York Times get a check and not me?
967
I don't think it's right or fair under fair use.
968
They're directly taking my content, which is very unique and specific to me.
969
So in theory, there's an argument to take it all the way to the Supreme Court and win and not have to pay anybody because OpenAI has slurped up the entire internet.
970
So they should settle because it's pretty confusing.
971
We've basically, in the age of AI, we've decided to surrender a lot of copyrights and surrender a lot of privacy.
972
Now OpenAI can record all of our conversations 24-7 in their Mac OS app already.
973
So we're giving up copyrights.
974
We're giving up privacy.
975
And we're going to learn where these new lines are, but they're not going to be the same as they were two years ago.
976
But the Supreme Court's conservative.
977
It's a bunch of Harvard grads.
978
I think the most fun thing about that answer is Jason, without blinking or laughing, described Harvard as, quote, conservative.
979
I think they would be so glad.
980
I think they're going to put that on their Harvard website.
981
Look, Harvard grads are conservative.
982
Leave us alone, please, damn it.
983
I don't know whether it's right to take on the Trump administration.
984
I know there's a lot of principled reasons, but I do think there's conservative, not politically, but with a small C, got to be the most conservative organization that I have any affiliation with.
985
Very conservative.
986
I think one nuance on this that gets to it, it we picked up in a very interesting reference we did on another deal, which is really interesting.
987
Obviously, OpenAI and all the models need access to quote-unquote modern news to be able to answer the real-time questions the way Perplexity initially did, and now everyone has copied.
988
You have LLM plus web search.
989
So they clearly need that.
990
So that's a given.
991
They need access to modern news sources.
992
A really interesting question, rather, is this.
993
If I have, as OpenAI, say, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, do I need New York Times?
994
In other words, is a third national news source additive or not?
995
It's a very interesting question.
996
I hadn't thought about it until I talked to this person who made the point.
997
Yes, you need news to give the full LLM experience, but do you need the third or fourth marginal news source?
998
Maybe not.
999
And that's the thing that would maybe make my hedge my bet.
1000
It may be a separate issue from what are the legal rights on this.
1001
You could imagine an LLM saying, I need to get modern news from AP and one national newspaper, but I sure as hell don't need six.
1002
Because if you think back, if you reflect even on your experience on a Sunday morning when you'd read three or four newspapers back when they were papers, by the time you got to the third, you're, I know already 90% of the content is repetitive.
1003
The argument for OpenAI gutting it out is saying, hey, I already have it from two or three people.
1004
Yeah, maybe I should have paid you for the past and maybe I'll lose that part of the case, but I don't need to license your content on an ongoing basis to be able to deliver the full search plus LLM experience, provided I have one provider.
1005
And if that's the case, there'll be an interesting game theory process going on on media content pricing.
1006
And that's why Jason with SASTA will get paid so handsomely because that's not the unique line of it.
1007
No, you think I'm confusing, but Harry, how much do you get paid by?
1008
I get three or four grand from Twitter a month.
1009
How much do you get?
1010
Your eyes are not.
1011
I'm so pissed off about this.
1012
I see everyone post it.
1013
I don't know how to do it.
1014, maybe.
1015
But if I'm making 50 grand a year for, and I know it's not the same because Twitter's opting to pay its creators, I'm getting paid 50 grand a year for my tweets.
1016
I want $500,000 a year from OpenAI for its SASTA content.
1017
It's more valuable.
1018
I just want 40 grand a month.
1019
You get 50 grand a year for tweeting.
1020
I would get 200 grand a year for tweeting.
1021
You might.
1022
Yeah, you might.
1023
I think the fun thing about this is it will drive very interesting conversations about what content is in fact valuable.
1024
Speaking of that, final one for you: Lindy Yaccarino, will she leave Twitter this year?
1025, it's a fun question.
1026
We get glimpses of Twitter's financials, X's financials.
1027
We don't see all of them, right?
1028, her job was to bring in the advertisers and create a buffer there.
1029
That doesn't seem to have been wildly successful.
1030
So I know this is mean to say.
1031
I'm only judging the public persona.
1032
I don't see how the team is managed internally.
1033, objectively, it seems one you could upgrade on the team.
1034
It seems of his C-level team and his companies.
1035
This seems the VP that maybe I'll upgrade this year.
1036
That may be true, but thinking pragmatically, if I was, and I never thought I'd say this, poor Mr.
1037
Elon, coming back from a bruising six months,, in government work and having five or six amazing companies to work with, plus Twitter, I'd probably say to myself, I'm just not going to take on the hard thing.
1038
Can I just focus on building cool engineering shit?
1039
Twitter, whatever.
1040, because remember, the person who changes the CEO is the board, or in this case, Elon himself.
1041
Do you just want the heartache, dude?
1042
Just let it run.
1043
Don't be a hero.
1044
I hear you, but, we forget,, Elon recruited Illiad to OpenAI.
1045
The guy's a good recruiter, but it seems she's the weakling on the team.
1046
When he has the moment in time, I think he will bring in the best media executive in the world that he can get.
1047
Because for all the folks that he has alienated the last few months, there are others who probably are bigger fans.
1048
Go find the best one of your,, lean into your super fans if you have them.
1049
That's where the magic is.
1050
Guys, thank you so much for doing this with me, as always.
1051
My favorite is always the comments.
1052
The comments, honestly, are always my favorites.
1053
And I so appreciate you both.
1054
This has been wonderful.
1055
Rory, 6 a.m.
1056, dude, credit.
1057
