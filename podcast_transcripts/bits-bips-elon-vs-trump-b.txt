1
I would be patient and stay long because I think the likelihood that we see a blow-off move upwards is far higher than what we see on the downside and probably of a greater percentage change in price.
2
Hi, everyone.
3
Welcome to Bits and Bips, exploring how crypto and macro collide one basis point at a time.
4
Today, we're going to talk about a whole bunch of things, mainly the Trump and Musk blow-up, the Circle IPO, some macro topics.
5
And again, Bitcoin Treasuries continues to be a hot topic.
6
But first, some quick intros.
7
I'm your host, James Seyfert, Tradify Archmaister, Lord of Bloomberg's End.
8
Here with Ron Alwalia, Maester of Wealth, Leader of Lumina.
9
How's going?
10
Steve Ehrlich, High Scribe of the Unchained Crypto Kingdom.
11
And then also joined by Salternullo, First Counsel of the Venture Court at A100X Ventures.
12
Good afternoon, everyone.
13
We're here to discuss the latest stories in the worlds of crypto and macro.
14
Just remember that nothing we say here is investment advice.

16
Before we begin, let's take a minute to hear from the sponsors who make this show possible.
17
Crypto moves fast.
18
It's why Bitwise launched the weekly CIO memo, a jargon-free summary of what's moving crypto markets, written by one of the best in the business, CIO Matt Hogan.

Carefully consider the extreme risks associated with crypto before investing.
22
All right.
23
Let's get into Elon and Trump.
24
I have a take on the market angle here, but, I don't know.
25
Obviously, this is also just drama, but, it's when I was watching this stuff blow up, it was, it was just, it was, it was so viral.
26
It was so intense.
27
It was, it was, I don't know, bravo housewives type stuff, but with people that matter.
28, so yeah, let's just get into it.
29
What's your market take here?
30
We'll go to you, Ram, first.
31
Do you have an overarching take of what's going on here and how it impacts markets?
32
There's no real market impact.
33
What drives markets are earnings growth, inflation, policy.
34
This is a tempest in a teaspot.
35
It really impacts Tesla more than anything else.
36
But even then, as relates to Tesla, it's not impacting Tesla's long-term or short-term earnings growth.
37
So,, you got a short-term reaction on the late tale of last week when this was brought into the public eye and Tesla sold off.
38
But those are just short-term reactions.
39
It's not an enduring reaction.
40
I have a few questions.
41
One is: I want to know how did Elon really get that punch in the eye?
42
It's not his son, which he claims.
43
Was it Besant?
44
Was it Navarro?
45
It's one of those two, I believe.
46
It was notable that the Olin show did not have a pod this weekend, right?
47
And that show is at the overlap of Musk and Trump.
48
And now the house is divided.
49
And they had a recording, but it was not released.
50
I took some satisfaction in that.
51 when narratives are pierced and threads splinter, you got to choose sides.
52
What side are you on?
53
I feel Elon, he's more American than most Americans.
54
He's created extraordinary wealth, hundreds of billions of dollars in value.
55
I'm not even a Tesla stock fan.
56
This is just a fact.
57
He's created enormous innovation in driverless cars, in technology to help people walk and have vision again, to do high-speed underground trains, to build a renaissance for American space and start satellite and inspire engineering.
58
And then he went to government, he went to Washington Mr.
59
Smith and said, I'm going to do a cut cost.
60
He slept on the floor of these federal buildings, brought in talent, which was not compensated, and he got a rug pull.
61
He went in with a mandate to cut costs, which the American budget desperately needed.
62
Not desperately.
63
We'll get by,.
64
We'll come back to that.
65
I think we'll be okay.
66
But it's the right thing to start to rein in this excess.
67
And he was rebuffed.
68
So I feel bad for him.
69
I was surprised that Elon took very sharp blows to Trump.
70
You don't do that.
71
You don't take a shot at the king.
72
What's the expression go?
73
Do you take a shot at the king, best not miss?
74,, he said that the reason the Epstein files weren't released because Trump is in them.
75
They doubled down on that.
76
Yeah, he had some other claim that was pretty insane.
77
You don't do that.
78
I think it was just a bad move.
79
I was surprised to see that today Trump said he wishes him well.
80
So, so far, so good.
81
Elon is saying that he wants to start a third party.
82
You could think the people who get around the hoop for that.
83
And starting a third party is hard, but he's credible.
84
He threw over $100 million in the campaign.
85
I'm sure the social media algorithm was modified.
86
He can help shape outcomes in a material way.
87
Ultimately, I think competition is good for the United States.
88
Competition in general, whether in athletics or academia or business or politics, competition is just good.
89
So I think however this plays out, it'll be good.
90
Last parting thought: there's a scene in Dante's Inferno, the Ninth Circle of Hell, where the count is eating and cannibalizing the archbishop.
91
And it reminded me of that scene.
92
It's about intertribal warfare, the consequences of disloyalty, and it reminded me of that.
93
You should be able to tolerate dissent and get back to civic debate.
94
It's true for the protesters on campuses that are disrupting education, but it's also true in, I think, Trump's inner circle.
95
You got to be able to have debate.
96
You got to have a Lincoln cabinet mindset where you're trying to find the best ideas and let truth rise to the surface, make the best decision you can.
97
Yeah,, overall, the, it's funny.
98
Two things I noticed.
99
One, Kosh Patel, the head of the FBI, was in the middle of recording a live podcast with Joe Rogan when all this started happening on Twitter.
100
And JD Vance was in the middle of recording a live podcast with Theo Vaughan while the middle of the, and they were both, oh, God,, that's, I'm not, blah, blah, blah.
101
JD Vance commented a little more than Kosh Patel was willing to, but,, it's just funny,, the whole ethos around,, people calling,, saying Trump helped won because of these podcast things.
102
And then,, these guys were in the middle of doing those podcasts and all this drop.
103
And I think,, overall, my overarching view is, Musk wants to cut costs.
104
He wants to save money.
105
And, that seems to be the real big blow up here.
106, the big, beautiful bill is going to add to the deficit.
107
I know Trump camp will just say they're,, trying to save and continue the taxes that were, that they did, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
108
They just wanted that to continue.
109
And without it, there would have been a huge hike in taxes for everyday Americans.
110
Okay, that's true, but it doesn't matter.
111 you let Musk do all this work and yeah, he saved billions, maybe tens, tens of billions of dollars, and you're just going to add a couple trillion to the deficit, arguably.
112
There's a lot more that can be done.
113
This isn't everything in the bill.
114
But I think this goes back to what does Lynn say?
115 nothing stops this drain, right?
116 this is the Republicans, they are going to blow the deficit because they're going to focus on tax cuts.
117
And the Democrats and liberals are going to blow out the deficit probably too because they want to give more money and do more things Medicare, Medicaid, any thing along those lines to help everyone, essentially.
118
So they want to hand money out and tax the rich.
119
And all of it is just spending more money.
120
And if you are going to be someone that's going to go in and preach some level austerity and not spending money or not giving tax cuts, you're never going to get elected.
121
So we're just on this path where nobody's going to stop the deficit spending train that we're on.
122
Sal, you're nodding your head.
123
What are your thoughts overall on this whole process?
124, how does it impact crypto or macro at all?
125
Or do you disagree or agree with anything Ron and I said?
126
No, I agree this setup.
127
I just think it's a disappointing outcome to what was a source of hope in two regards.
128, obviously, one on rein in spend,, put some arms around excess and then hopefully push forward into a new path.
129
And I think this is the story of how a brilliant entrepreneur hits,, a brick wall in the context of government and mixed incentive schemes.
130
You were highlighting, James, the incentives of politicians to remain elected, whether Democrat or Republican, are not directly aligned with the mandate that Elon was pushing forward alongside Trump.
131
I think Trump, in a relatively diplomatic fashion, recognizes the reality of what the current state looks in both the House and Senate and played into favor to the best possible outcome that it could.
132
It seemed to me Elon, after what, 130 days of, as Ron was describing, sleeping on the floor and making huge trade-offs in terms of the energy, effort, and time that he could put forward into his companies,, hits huge frustration.
133
And for me, it was disappointing to see it boil over in such a public fashion.
134
Because I think some of those points around the Dante's Inferno analogy, there may not be full reparations around this.
135
And so maybe a parting of two aligned camps.
136
I think he'll walk back the discussion around the third party concept.
137
Although, candidly, I would support that.
138
Part of this issue set we find for 30 years of stalemates is because of a two-party system.
139
But that's been a really hard challenge and has been tried many times over.
140
So overall, hopefully they can mend, but pretty disappointing to see the public spat.
141
I was walking home from CVC.
142
My wife was calling me, telling me about the spat because it had overflowed from X to Instagram and to TikTok and all those things.
143
I'm just, oh man, couldn't believe what she was telling me.
144
By the way, did you see Elon also gave a nod to JD Vance?
145
He, I think the second defense is he supported Trump's impeachment in a tweet.
146
I was, what are you doing, buddy?
147
You're bringing the wrath on.
148
You don't, you don't,, those are two serious shots.
149
What apparently started this is over the weekend, Elon's preferred leader of the space station, NASA, wasn't appointed.
150
And that person controls budget for SpaceX.
151
And it's, come on, how do you, how does Elon not get the win on that for everything he did?
152
So I could see being pissed on that account.
153
And now what I read this morning is that NASA is looking at alternatives, the NASA director is looking at alternatives.
154
And now you're seeing competitors to SpaceX Rocket Lab, I'm long Rocket Lab, by the way, go up a couple points because of the potential share shift in revenue.
155
Yeah,, the New York Times did a podcast talk around this, and what they came away with, and obviously,, there's people here hearing that I listened to the New York Times podcast, probably freaking out.
156
So they do a lot of good work over there still, despite some of the episodes.
157 when they cover crypto, you listen to it.
158
I'm, you didn't talk to anybody who knows anything about this.
159, you have no idea what you're talking about.
160
And they have these guests on that are supposed experts.
161
All right, I don't want to go down the sidetrack, but it's crazy.
162
But they basically said it was the spending first and then the Isaacman thing, who was supposed to run NASA, which all in had Isaacman on their podcast this week to talk about not being the pointe.
163
And he was very cagey around it.
164
But, one, he sounded he would have been awesome to run NASA.
165, I loved everything that guy was saying.
166
It sounded awesome.
167
But it really came down to the fact that he had contributed to the Democrat, a bunch of Democratic politicians.
168
And Trump was, I can't have this guy running NASA.
169
But at the same time, it's the guy that Musk wanted.
170
He probably would have been very good, though, maybe would have leaned a little on SpaceX.
171
But then again, SpaceX is miles and miles ahead of everyone else in the industry.
172
Yeah.
173, Steve, you didn't get a chance to chime in yet.
174, what are your thoughts real quick on the Musk-Trump breakup and what it could mean?
175
Yeah, I had a couple.
176, one, first, I guess I'm upset that SNL is done for the summer because this week's episode would have been epic.
177
Ron, you said in Dante's Inferno, but, when all this happened, it made me think of House of Cards, season two in particular, when Frank was fighting with what was his name, Raymond Tusk, that billionaire from St.
178
Louis that was a backer of the president.
179
And they kept going back and forth and having this unfragile alliance, or I guess fragile alliance is the right way to say it, until it eventually broke at the end of season two.
180
And Underwood won.
181
I forget exactly how it all worked out, but Underwood ended up winning.
182
And I think Tusk went to jail or something that.
183
Musk and Tusk.
184
That's funny.
185
But the thing is, it was a good reminder, I think, in some ways that although these two are obviously very powerful people, they are not equal in any way.
186
And if you go back in history, every time that there's these oligarch billionaires that are trying to partner with the president or prime minister or whatever, and then there's a breakup, it's the oligarch that suffers.
187
Do you guys remember in 2020 when Jack Ma criticized Chinese financial regulators and they abruptly pulled the Alibaba IPO?
188
It was in the summer of 2020.
189
And then we didn't hear from Jack Ma for months or years until that.
190, this happens over and over again.
191
And it's interesting that Musk did not anticipate that coming because when it happened, it was Trump was going to be the one that's going to win because they have the guns.
192 the U.S.
193
government are, that's where the actual power lies, as we learned from Frank Underwood.
194
And at some point,, Musk probably has some dirt on Trump, but Trump doesn't have to face the voters again.
195
So that was inevitable.
196
And then the one other thing that I thought of too, because I know we want to move on, it underscored for me, going back to crypto, how important it is that we get crypto legislation passed while we can.
197
Because at some point, you need Congress to settle these rules and laws for now and hopefully for always.
198
And if we get a new government in place, a Democratic government that wants to appoint Gary Gensler 2.0, they can do that.
199
And again, the power between private industry and the government for now, it falls in the government.
200
So I know crypto did pretty well under Gensler, all things considered, but it's really important to get this settled now because a new government could come in and do a complete 180 just Trump did to Biden's policies.
201
Yeah,, Stephen, I think you hit the nail on the head with this because that's the biggest risk to this space in particular: a broader derailment of policy.
202
If there's fragmentation and ultimately the spending bill doesn't pass, that becomes the next iteration becomes priority.
203
Then you have to fight upstream around stablecoin regulation, getting the genus act through.
204
So I think distraction and disorientation from this is the biggest risk towards the legislative agenda for crypto.
205
I don't think it'll slow it down.
206, I don't think this will slow it down.
207
But what one last fictional reference is: I love the Frank Underwood one, but Game of Thrones reference.
208
When Littlefinger confronts Cersei and he makes a threat, and he says, look, knowledge is power.
209
Then Cersei has her guards put a sword to his neck.
210
And she says, power is power.
211
Anyway, last fictional reference there.
212
I'm sure we'll find some more in the next hour.
213
Yeah,, I just hope some this settle.
214, one, I guess you, Sal, you said it was disappointing.
215
At the same time, I love watching it blow up.
216
It was so entertaining, but I agree with you.
217
It's just sad that two men were going to blow, arguably two of the most powerful men in the world.
218 you have the richest man in the world who literally has the most successful rocket company in the world, one of the most successful car companies in the world, the president of the United States, and they're just going to blows high school kids on social media.
219
Entertaining, but it'd be a lot better if there wasn't these types of people doing it.
220
Let's move on to the Circle IPO.
221
So Circle IPO'd, what is it, $31, I think?
222
It's now trading at $118 a share, roughly just under $26 billion valuation.
223
I guess I'll turn it over to you guys.
224
Let's go to Sal first.
225
What do you think of the valuation here?
226, do you think $26 billion is the right valuation?
227
And we were chatting about this on the intro as we were coming into the episode, but Ron pointed this out.
228
It's where crypto speculation hits public market sentiment.
229
There has been a lot of stuff floating around in X comparing value of Coinbase as it relates to value of Circle in context of the revenue share agreement they have, which is an interesting comparison and potentially arbitrage opportunity, but I think it misses the point on the broader competitive landscape that stablecoins will enter over the next two to three years.
230
So I think it's a very exciting moment for everyone who was in the prior rounds of Circle that backed Jeremy and Sean and team through multiple pivots and iteration, even pre-existence of USDC, because they pulled a rabbit out of the hat multiple times to see that company through and ultimately found product market fit at scale.
231
So it's a huge win for the industry.
232
But where it sits today, I would say, is not consistent with how we look at fundamental valuation, especially on a forward outlook.
233
Yeah,, you just look at this and it's, it's the valuation is 50% of the U.S., the USDC in circulation, essentially.
234
Which I don't know how you get into that.
235, I know Tether and Circle are very different businesses, but I look at them and it's just, not only that, but Tether's,, Circle's costs and expenses are an order of math.
236 Tether is so much more profitable, it's not even worth discussing.
237
So I'm looking at this valuation and I'm thinking, damn, what do you think Tether would be going public for if they ever IPO'd in U.S.
238
markets, which I would bet that's never going to happen.
239
But what are your thoughts, Ron?
240, do you think that do you think it's overvalued right now at $117, $18 a share?
241
Well, I think what's the trailing PE ratio, I think it's a balmy 363 times trailing range.
242
So it might be a little bit overvalued, right?
243
It's an on-chain digital bank.
244
Bank banks are usually valued at price to book value.
245
Competition is coming.
246 there's a distinction between a trade and an investment.
247
Here I'm giving you the investment lens.
248
Okay, the investment lens is, yeah, it's overvalued.
249
The competition is coming.
250
I'd love to get Austin Campbell's view here.
251
He's one of my favorite humans and very sharp on stable coins.
252
And I caught up together with him last week and he said, Look, imagine the big banks get together and launch a stablecoin and they have distribution.
253
They can integrate it with their offerings.
254
They can integrate it with Zell.
255
That's going to happen.
256
They're going to approach Coinbase.
257
They can provide distribution.
258
They can integrate in ways that Circle may not be able to.
259
Stripe can do the same.
260
And Circle's margins are high because they're paying $0, zero payment for holding digital currency.
261
That has to change.
262
And the innovation is that now you have digital currency in your wallet that accrues interest.
263
That's an amazing innovation to have digital currency just accrues into.
264
The concept of having a wallet where you get more dollar bills over time when you hold it.
265
That's the metaphor.
266
That's the analogy for what this is.
267
But you're now seeing a proliferation of stable coins.
268
Stable coins are the hottest theme in venture capital, which probably means you want to run away from the hills as a venture investor.
269
But you're going to get a bunch of players into the market and they are going to compete on yield.
270
I'm having a number of conversations with stablecoin insurers because we invest in private yield generating opportunities at Lumida.
271
So stablecoin insurers want reliable, enduring sources of yield so they can pay out to their end customers and differentiate their product offerings.
272
That's going to happen.
273
Kylo's got a better mode and they're better positioned.
274
They own the international scene.
275
They're linked up with Cantor and Howard Luttnick.
276
They don't need any capital, though, so that capital raise is not coming anytime soon.
277
But an amazing success, I think the other take is that this is going to reliquefy venture markets.
278
You have the Core Weave IPO, which was also this commingling of crypto and AI.
279
They start as an Ethereum miner.
280
And now you've got this other IPO.
281
You're going to see a few more.
282
You're going to see Kraken, for example.
283
What about Chainalysis?
284
What about a Falcon X?
285
That's going to reinvigorate venture capital ecosystems by creating distributions to LPs.
286
And the LPs are saying, show me DPI.
287
They're saying, show me the money so I can re-up in your next fund.
288
And that's very healthy for the venture ecosystem within digital assets.
289
Yeah,, well, you brought up venture.
290, before we go to you, Steve, I don't mean to have you go last again on this topic, but you brought up venture, and you said,, I'm curious, Sal,, what are you guys seeing on the stable coin?
291, how many,, what are you seeing in that side of the investment business?
292
Yeah,, it was a dry spell on DPI to everyone.
293
And the conversation that you're hearing in the fundraising context was the impact of the denominator effect on institutional investors being overweight private markets with 21 and 22 marks rolling into the portfolio diversification models, no DPI and liquidity to re-up and reallocate, which led to, I don't know if you guys saw the cartograph of venture raises by emerging managers through the last 15 years in 2025, albeit only halfway through the year, tracking to 2009 figures for emergent managers.
294
And naturally, that's a pretty wild comparison.
295
I think we'll benchmark out slightly higher because the second half of this year will be driven by a number of these IPO and MA events.
296
But the fundraising environment was super, super hard the last 12 months, largely driven by what Ron was describing, which is investors not getting liquidity to re-up.
297
So I'm hopeful we have a little bit more time left in our fundraise.
298
I'm hopeful it gets easier.
299
I don't want to be a fool in that hope, but it does seem this is momentum towards a broader wave of public market offerings and probably continued MA traction.
300
So we'll see where it shakes out.
301
But if you remember, even six weeks ago, post-Liberation Day and macro trade stuff, there was a whole conversation as to whether or not Circle would even pursue the IPO track at this point or they would delay it.
302
And I think they took a bold step forward and look at how they've been rewarded thus far in public markets.
303
So hopefully that shows a number of other companies Kraken that the path forward might have uncertainty around it, but public markets are clamoring for exposure to mature companies in this space that can really be looked at through a fundamental lens, whether or not they're valued appropriately based on that data.
304
Yeah,, we were looking at Circle as getting acquired by Ripple or Coinbase potentially.
305
But real quick, Sal, before we go to Steve, you talked about the fundraising side and distributing capital from investments, but how many deals are you seeing that are in the stable?
306
You said you were expecting a lot of competition in the stablecoin space.
307
I'm assuming that's because you see a ton of people trying to build in the stablecoin space and potential deals and PowerPoints that come across your desk.
308
So, can you talk a little bit about that too?
309
Yeah, we've seen an inordinate number of deals that are playing in the stablecoin space at different layers of the stack.
310
Maybe six to nine months ago, there was a lot of conversation around how do we design application-specific or purpose-built layer one networks.
311
We've done a project in that space.
312
And then, more recently, we've seen a bunch of projects that are looking at XUSD stablecoins, which candidly, from a market traction and adoption perspective, has been quite dismal.
313
But you are starting to see a little bit better product market fit for specific payment corridors.
314
So, thank you, US to Latin America, some of the Asian jurisdictions that collaborate tightly in a trade context.
315
So, I am of the opinion that stablecoins broadly are generally overvalued from a deal perspective right now.
316
We've been super prudent, and of 20 deals in this fund, have one in that category.
317
And I think it's arguably on equal terms in terms of innovation and infrastructure versus what you've seen Tesla mixing words tethered you with Plasma.
318
So that project is called One Money from Brian Schroeder, who was the former CEO of Binance US.
319
So, yeah, the deal values are quite high on stablecoin projects.
320
Species have been clamoring after them to bridge acquisitions, set the terms in terms of what the forward outlook on an MA path could be.
321
So, we'll see how it goes.
322
But, generally, proceeding quite cautious on our side.
323
All right, Steve.
324
What's your take on Circle?
325
Do you think it's,, I don't know if you have a strong opinion whether it's overvalue, but what's your view?
326
What's your view here?
327
It's interesting.
328
The IPO had me think of a few ideas came to mind.
329, for one, we were talking about power in the first segment, and that I started thinking about that again, just in relation to the profitability of USDC for Coinbase vis-a-vis Circle, which I know we talked about.
330, there are some numbers Coinbase might be, make 10 times, USDC might be 10 times as profitable for Coinbase as it is for Circle, which seems to be crazy and unsustainable.
331
Two, I did a profile in Jeremy Leir for Forbes a couple years ago, and in that story, I interviewed a congressman who has to remain anonymous, but he sits on the House Financial Services Committee.
332
And I asked him the very question that I think Ram, you mentioned,, what happens when JP Morgan and Wells and all these other banks, if there is legislation, if they decide to launch a stablecoin?
333
And this Congressman said to me, they're just going to crush Circle.
334
And it's funny, Tether thinks the same thing.
335
I interviewed Paolo because I've done multiple stories on him too.
336
And Paolo said the same thing to me, but he said, we're focused on international users.
337, let JPMorgan come and do their thing.
338
They serve a different client base.
339
So all that was fascinating to me.
340
But the one thing I just wanted to point out quickly, too, is I interviewed Circle's Chief Strategy Officer Dante Desparte on Thursday, I believe.
341
The whole conversation was on the record.
342
I wrote a story about it, but most things you guys know, I can only fit a small portion of what we're talking about in the story.
343
And a couple things I wasn't able to fit in.
344
For one, I asked him what he thought about the big disparity between Circle's profitability and Coinbases.
345
And I asked him twice, and he demured.
346
He didn't really want to get into that.
347
But then I also asked him: there seems, this is a wildly successful IPO, and it seems in many ways to be divorced from just the pure financial fundamentals that we've spoken about here.
348
So I said,, what was the story that you sold to the investors that they're looking past that and giving you credit for much more than just your balance sheet may suggest?
349
And frankly, it was a little bit tough.
350
His answer was a little bit tough for me to read.
351, I know people, stable coins are just these homogenous products, but they're not entirely because Circle is behind the scenes.
352
They're spending millions on R<unk>D to build out infrastructure to support 20 different chains, to make it easy to move tokens from one chain to another.
353
Integrations with different payment providers and platforms.
354
Regulation is a big one.
355, they're mica-compliant.
356
They're compliant in the UAE.
357
They're compliant in Japan.
358, they're doing all these things.
359
And the big bet is that it's all going to pay off, and they're going to have this critical mass scale that will give them a moat against the money center mechs.
360, that plus hype, it must be what all these different investors are betting on.
361
But these valuations are so far divorced from the fundamentals that there's going to have to be a climb down no matter what.
362, nothing can stay this forever.
363
Yeah, you brought up the Coinbase versus Circle divide.
364, Jeff Park had a great tweet, friend of the show from Bitwise talked about,, there's an arm here to play.
365, just looking at this, it's insane.
366
So I said, Circle's just about 26 billion in market cap, and Coinbase is 65 billion.
367
And they get a lot of their profitability from the yield that they, I think they split 50% of the yield with Circle.
368
And I think anything that's minted on Circle, they get to keep all of the yield over a certain period of time.
369
But, it comes back to me a huge part of this business is tied to rates.
370
So, if we ever get into a situation where we'll talk about macro next, but if we get into a situation where rates get cut,, their profitability is getting hit hard.
371
And their expenses, you were talking about it, Steve, and they didn't really give an answer.
372
They pay their executives extremely well.
373
Their costs to the people that work there, they have a lot of people that work there and they pay them very, very well, which is the main difference that I see.
374, compared to revenue or profit per employee,, again, Circle's a very different business from what they're doing.
375
You talked about it, but, it's not even remotely in the same ballpark as what Tether is doing.
376
So, yeah, there's definitely going to be some ARB there.
377
A bit more on the banks.
378
The other edge that the banks have is they can re-hypothecate.
379
So, today, what Circle does is they invest in treasuries.
380
If a bank can re-hypothecate and they have on average 10 turns of leverage, if you look at the ratio of their liabilities to equity, they can make more money.
381
So, they can make a more lucrative bid to Coinbase.
382
And Coinbase is the distribution partner.
383
Yes, USDC's built brand, but again, consumers are savvy.
384
They're going to go to whatever has the highest yield and the highest quality.
385
And they're going to go to other brands they recognize too.
386
And those banks will install those stable coins in their offerings.
387
They'll make them native.
388
So, yeah, I think Circle's in a top position.
389
By the way, 20% of Circle's market cap traded today.
390
So, this is a meme stock.
391
This is not a, oh, what did the investors get on board with?
392
This is just crypto interacting with public equities.
393
I question there, Ron.
394, isn't the stablecoin bill going to prevent them from doing any rehypothecation?
395
And rational reserve banking.
396
Well, so if you're a bank issuer of a stablecoin, though, why would you prevent why would you be prevented from rehypothecation?
397
That's your bread and butter business.
398
If you want to expand lending to Main Street, you should want to have banks involved here.
399
Otherwise, all the circle deposits are financing the largesse of the federal government.
400
Yeah.
401
There's no way that the Genius Act's going to going to allow rehypothecation.
402, it's a very strict regulatory.
403
And again, one other question to ask Dante, which I know is in the minds of lots of people, is, is there ever going to be a world where they're going to be able to share yield or where they're willing to share yield with their customers because it's so high, at least right now?
404
And basically the answer he gave, which I agree with, is that that would invite a much wider regulatory net or set of regulations than what they're dealing with now, which is already somewhat complicated because then it's technically a security.
405
And I know banks have exemptions from having to register to the SEC to offer things savings accounts and stuff, but it becomes much more complicated.
406
And that would lead to rehypothecation and all those other things.
407
And frankly, at least I got the sense from Circle is they don't want any part of that.
408, they're a non-bank, so they can't.
409
So they're at a structural disadvantage.
410
Yeah.
411
Yeah.
412
Before we move off for this topic, do we want to there?
413
There was a lot of backlash with the way that the IPO was allocated.
414, number one topic on this is Jeff Dorman from ARCA had a long, a long letter out there that was very aggressive and upset about the way that the IPO is allocated.
415
I think they requested 10 million or five, what if they request $5 million and got $10 and got $135,000?
416
So I don't know.
417
I guess I'd be annoyed there too as well.
418,, this, to me, brings back to the fact that the IPO is a very Wall Street market.
419
It's a different market versus Circle, which is typically used to paying in DeFi.
420
And, I feel a Wall Street bank can't not, you're going up against BlackRock here.
421, they're going to get the allocation, or at least a bigger portion of the allocation.
422
So there's this tension here between sticking with your DeFi friends and family, if you will, versus you need to have a successful IPO.
423
And Steve, you said it was a very successful IPO.
424
I would argue that the bankers left too much money on the sidelines.
425, they priced this at $31 a share.
426, granted, people are locked up and who knows where it's going to sell.
427
Everyone here has said basically they think this is overpriced, but,, it could come back down more into that range.
428
We'll see exactly where things settle longer term.
429
But Sal, what do you think about the that trend over there of Wall Street versus DeFi and the allocations that certain people got?
430
And yeah.
431
Yeah,, I was saying this before, part of what Jeff was describing in that thread was around in the context of crypto and web-free, there's all of this ecosystem incentive alignment and people who are backing,, businesses who are backing each other have aligned incentives towards outcomes.
432
And that was at a mismatch with how this IPO roadshow and allocation structure came to play.
433
And so just Wall Street clashing with ecosystem incentive structures.
434
And I would be super frustrated as well on the allocation, but not surprised because every investment banker that's involved in this roadshow has five or six more IPOs lined up and is looking to pad the books of all the different buyers to make sure they have a seat at the table in the next one.
435
So,, empathy for the frustration.
436
I think you ended up pulling the tweet tweet thread down.
437
But I'm not surprised that that's how this shook out.
438
Yeah, I feel bad for it, Jeff.
439
I can share a bit more how Wall Street IPOs work and share a personal anecdote.
440
But if you're an IPO banker, your primary clientele is not the CFO who's doing their first and last IPO most likely.
441
You take a company public once.
442
It's the buy side because the buy side has to show up for every new deal that's offered.
443
What the buy side wants, the buy side gets.
444
That's the banker's primary clientele.
445
So the investors that get dibs on the allocation table are those that make the most money for the bank.
446
Who are those?
447
Those are players 0.72, Millennium Technologies, Citadel.
448
And you'll notice a number, if not all, those players are also flippers of the IPO.
449
They're not long enduring capital.
450
So it's not the best capital for an issuer.
451
An issuer wants stable diamond hands that believes in the thesis.
452
You can get that in a direct listing, what Google did when they went public.
453
And they didn't have an investment bank to bring both sides together.
454
I love to see more of that on chain, by the way.
455
Topic for another time.
456
So I had an experience this last summer where at Lumida, we managed to get on that cap table for Brad Jacobs.
457
Brad Jacob's the roll-up king.
458
He built waste management and United Rentals.
459, Tracy and Joe interviewed them, James, a few times on their show.
460
So we got on that interview.
461
Fantastic interview.
462
The guy is an Uber mensch.
463
He literally wrote a book called How to Make Billions.
464
And you can only write that if you've made billions multiple of times, never went to college, just serial roll-up, billionaire, built it with his hands and his tenacity.
465
So we managed to get on the cap table at 9.14 in a next to Sequoia Heritage, the Walton family, Duke University.
466
These were personal friends of Brad, phone call money for Brad.
467
We had an England of the CFO.
468
We raised $40 million into an SPV.
469
We spun up in two weeks.
470
These deals happen fast.
471, oh, it's going to happen.
472
Circle, they're looking at MA.
473
Two weeks later, they're going public.
474
That's how fast these things go, right?
475
And then I saw this article in the Wall Street Journal.
476
I'll share it on the screen here.
477
And this is from July.
478
This is 11 months ago.
479
Okay.
480
They said Brad Jacobs, QXO, raises $620 million as Kushner to the board.
481
And then what happens is I get a phone call three hours later saying, Ram, by the way, yeah, your allocation, it got cut back.
482
We're sorry.
483
We're sending you wires back.
484
Here's 90% of your capital back.
485
That cost us.
486
Look at QXO.
487
Now it's $20 a share now.
488
It was $9 11 months ago.
489
So that cost our LPs and our firm millions and millions of dollars.
490
It sucks.
491
It's terrible.
492
And we hustled.
493
We did hard work.
494, he did more than I did.
495
Jeff helped make that business success.
496
We just hustled to get on the deal.
497
That was our value added.
498
Yeah,, he stuck with them through SVB and all those other things.
499, it was Circle was in rough shape at multiple times throughout this whole thing.
500
The other one we didn't talk about, you were talking about potential IPOs.
501, earlier this week, it was reported that Jem and I filed a confidential S1 to PO for an IPO.
502
Obviously, the Winklevolts Twins Exchange.
503
I have a list of companies I'm expecting to go IPO this year, and that was one of them.
504
So that's good.
505
But the first thing I thought was not very confidential if somebody's breaking the news that a confidential S1 was filed.
506
Do you guys have any thoughts on Gemini going public?
507
I know you guys, multiple people mentioned Krakton, but Gemini seems to be next up.
508
Correct me if I'm wrong.
509
I don't think confidential means it's secret that they're filing.
510
I think it's just that they're not releasing.
511, my thought about Gemini is really just,, they went through hell with all the SPF, FTX stuff.
512, they faced inquiries from the SEC, and I know that went away with the new administration, but DOJ, with the EARN program, et cetera.
513
And frankly, I haven't really heard a lot from them since all of that happened.
514
I know the Winklevi are insanely rich just by themselves, and they're big.
515
Did you play Winklevi?
516
Is that a proper term?
517
I've heard it before, too.
518
I know multiple people do it.
519
I met the Twins at Bitcoin Vegas.
520
That's just my long way of saying that.
521
I'm really curious to see what their numbers are going to be.
522
I don't know what the rationale is for not releasing, filing a proper S1 yet.
523, maybe it's just that they want to see what the market looks and time it because they have to know as encouraging as it was for the Serb IPO that that is clearly unsustainable.
524
But, their volumes are not particularly high and their platform is relatively expensive.
525
And, they took a huge hit reputationally when they got tied up with Gemini and the Earn program and all of that stuff.
526
So I'm really interested to see what story they're going to try to sell to investors beyond just, hey, we're next in line and people are putting $500 million in random companies buying XRP.
527
Why not give it to us?
528, that's what I'm interested in.
529
Yeah,, the one thing...
530
A few things I would say about Gemini.
531
They definitely took a hit when Genesis blew up with the FTX thing and they had all their money with Genesis and the Earn program.
532
The one thing I will say to Gemini, they're the only people I know, and a great cost to the Winklevoss twins and Gemini, the company, they made every single one of their customers whole that were in that earned program in kind, not just dollarized.
533
So a lot of the FTX people are, they're whole, but they're whole at Bitcoin when it was worth,, $16,000.
534
So yeah, they got their cash back for what they held in most cases, but they didn't get it back.
535
Where Gemini is, I don't know of anyone else that did that in crypto, which is, in my opinion, huge win.
536
The other thing I would say is that the one thing I saw all over at Bitcoin Vegas, they just launched a Gemini credit card where your rewards can be in crypto.
537
Typically, it defaults to Bitcoin.
538
So that's another growth area.
539
The other thing I would say against, we've got all these exchanges, Gemini, Kraken, Coinbase.
540
I look at the fees for trading and I compare it to what I'm used to in the ETF world when I'm looking at spreads and transaction fees.
541
And man, they are juicy fees.
542
At some point, it's going to have to come down.
543
So if I were an exchange, I'd launch now when they're still able to charge.
544
Some of the recurring fees, even on Coinbase, I think is still 3%.
545
It's absolutely insane.
546
That's 1970s Wall Street fees to buy and trade stocks.
547
Sorry.
548
I didn't mean to go on that.
549
No, I agree.
550
I think 100%.
551
This is all late cycle behavior.
552
IPOs happen.
553
The IPO cycle happens every couple of years.
554
I wouldn't be surprised.
555
It's a a hypothesis that I have right now: that Q4 would be a top in digital assets just by seeing the flood of new issuance and IPOs and just the peaks in animal spirits that you're seeing emerge now.
556
So just keep your wits about you.
557
And when Coinbase went public in April 21, that was the top in Bitcoin miners, which is a high beta leading expression on digital assets.
558
And then Bitcoin started to follow a few months later in September and November.
559
So I think you're,, clock started, right?
560
Maybe six months away, maybe Q4, maybe after these bills get passed and people have peak euphoria.
561
So I think it's important just to maintain perspective, just enjoy the ride.
562
The last leg of these rallies can be very significant, right?
563
The last one-third can be half the rally,.
564
So, but I think you got to keep your head about you.
565
I think it's going to be interesting to see what the relative pricing structure is of the next wave of exchanges versus where Coinbase sits today and Circle sits on a benchmark.
566
And I just can't imagine that the euphoria that we saw over Circle continues to trickle down across the next three or four exchange category listing events.
567
I do think they'll happen, but I'm just interested to see at what point do animal spirits get exhausted over clamoring for the next issuance opportunity.
568
So I appreciate Ron's point of keep your head about you, because I think timing-wise, we're looking out towards the end of this year, Q126.
569
I do think there's going to be a pretty wild, explosive moment that comes in relatively short order.
570
And if the IPO market continues through that time frame, it's just going to reinforce it.
571
But we've all lived in this space long enough to know it doesn't last forever.
572
Great.
573
One other point is Robin Hood is focusing more and more on crypto.
574
eToro went public recently.
575
So competition is intensifying.
576
Coinbase was the dominant leader.
577
People rallied around Coinbase, especially when they were litigating or facing litigation for the SEC, really both sides.
578
Now you have increasing competition, so that that should lead to fee compression.
579
You have proliferation of ETFs, which is indirect competition as well.
580
So it's a different backdrop than it was two years ago.
581
Yeah, that Q4 timing,, I just think there's a decent chance we could see some altcoins get approved for ETF wrapper this summer, potentially.
582
We're going to see basket pilots, in our opinion, approved this summer.
583
But even still, the deadlines for a lot of these other altcoins, there's 10 of them on file right now.
584
Is that Q4 time range that you guys are talking about, the final deadline, and we think they're going to be approved?
585
So we could see, it's not just the stuff you were talking about, the ETF world, we could see everything.
586
One anecdote.
587
So in the DOVCOM era, and you guys might remember this, 3Com spun out a business called PalmPilot.
588
PalmPilot went public.
589
It was worth more than 3Com, even though 3Com owned 99% of it.
590
So these mispricings and arbitrage between related entities are phenomena that you see as you get closer to the top, nonsense stuff.
591
So,, we are seeing something that to Jeff Park's point around the relationship between Circle and Coinbase.
592
Before we move on to macro and then we'll wrap up, even though there's so many other topics we can get into, we got to hear from our sponsors who make this show possible real quick.
593
Hi, it's Matt Hogan, the Chief Investment Officer for Bitwise Asset Management.
594
Each week, I write a five-minute memo on the biggest topic impacting crypto.
595
This week, I take a look at Circle's Blockbuster IPO and what it tells us about how to build a comprehensive crypto portfolio.
596
The TLDR, if you're just holding crypto assets Bitcoin and Ethereum, you may be missing one of the most valuable categories where crypto is going to accrue value.
597
Check out how to fix that at bitwiseinvestments.com/slash CIO memo.
598
That's bitwiseinvestments.com/slash CIO memo.
599
Carefully consider the extreme risks associated with crypto before investing.
600
All right, guys.
601
Let's move to macro real quick, I guess.
602
Ron, what are you watching right now, macro?
603
We talked a lot about jobs last time.
604
It looks hiring slowed in May a little bit.
605
So, continuing of this,, not hot jobs market, but also not completely dead.
606, and anything you're particularly watching with rates and markets and macro?
607
Yeah, look,, so much bad news is priced in.
608
It's almost this market's inoculated against all sorts of risks.
609
And you meanwhile, you've got Ray Dalio who keeps pining the table around the imminent demise of the U.S.
610
debt.
611
I don't think that's going to happen.
612
Larry Summers also was critiquing the big beautiful bill and tariff, saying that it could cause a recession.
613
I don't think that'll happen.
614
I'm not a fan of tariffs.
615
I'm not a fan of excessive spending either.
616
I just think it's hyperbole.
617
They're just overreading into it.
618
So, what are the risks facing the markets?
619
Well, one is tariffs.
620
I was at Best Buy this weekend to just take a quick look at what prices are doing.
621
Prices didn't go up.
622
I talked to their sales associates.
623
Prices didn't go up there.
624
They are going up in auto.
625
So auto sales were accelerated forward.
626
Parents bought cars for their kids.
627
They just want to get ahead of it before even their kids were of age to drive.
628
So auto inflation was up 2.5% year over year.
629
So you are seeing that in, and that's a big ticket item.
630
So large, durable goods, you are seeing that.
631
But in areas where you have deflation and natural deflation, semiconductors and plasma TVs and electronics, you're not going to see that.
632
And that,, that makes sense.
633
So the market seems to be immunized from tariffs.
634
Austerity is off the table.
635
It's immunized from that.
636
Inflation's still declining.
637
I expect you'll get a summer whiff of inflation.
638, the claims data looks fine.
639
I wouldn't be surprised if there's some volatility in unemployment, some bad news that's temporary.
640
Seems to happen every summer.
641
But there are a lot of people who are just overly bearish in a backdrop where you've got strong earnings growth and baby boomers of $60 trillion in assets that are spending.
642
They're spending on cruise lines and travel and leisure and restaurants.
643
So overall,, I don't see economic weakness.
644
I don't see economic weakness.
645
Yeah, CapEx spending is up, the government spending, consumers hanging in there a champ.
646
Consumers are changing their consumption basket.
647
Yes, that's happening.
648
But overall, I think things are fine.
649
I think, and productivity growth is a story that Ray Dalio and Larry Summers are getting wrong.
650, the AI story is real.
651
We are seeing innovation.
652
The adoption rates are faster than we've seen of technologies and the internet.
653
It took 10 years for online trading to become a thing.
654
We're moving much faster.
655
And that can be a provider of relief for the fiscal spending and inflation issues that we have.
656
Yeah,, I think that's a good point.
657, overall, it comes down to, we're going to keep spending, and it's a matter of whether we can grow ourselves out of it.
658
It seems Besson, even over the last couple of weeks, has changed his tune on that topic.
659
He seems to say we're going to have to grow ourselves out of it, which is AI, I guess.
660
It literally comes down to AI in my point of view.
661
But Steve,, if we go back and we look at what's going on with trade, the most recent reports that have come out, are trade deficits cut in half.
662
So your difference between your imports and exports basically because we stopped importing stuff because of the tariffs over the last few weeks in the most recent round.
663
So how much of that is stopped versus going to pick up again now that there's a 90-day stop?
664
The other thing I would point out is that U.S.
665
and Chinese trade officials are meeting in London, I think today, to hash out a bit of a deal here.
666
So what are your thoughts here?
667, we're looking at Chinese exports that are at the biggest collapse since 2020 to the U.S.
668
specifically.
669
So basically, trade between the U.S.
670
and China has all but halted, not completely.
671
So, Steve, what are your thoughts on the major side of things?
672
It's really easy to cut your deficit when you just stop buying things.
673
I have a few thoughts.
674, I'm really interested to see what's going to happen with the talks between the U.S.
675
and China, I guess, today and tomorrow.
676
I know Letting's there today.
677
He wasn't there for the first round that apparently went well, but we all saw how that turned out.
678, we've spoken about this before.
679
I don't quite know how this deal is going to work.
680, China, because of the housing market crisis and all sorts of issues over there with declining consumption,, they are forced to support the manufacturing base, and that's exactly what the U.S.
681
is trying to curtail so we can grow our own.
682
I don't know quite what that deal looks.
683
And so I'm with Rahm.
684, things are just status quo.
685
I believe we get April's inflation numbers on Wednesday, and I'm really interested to see what will happen there because I do think expectations are a slight tick up, which could lower the chances of the Fed reducing rates anytime soon.
686
And the other thing that's on my mind a little bit, beside from just the Trump court, Trump trying to peel that international court, I forget what the exact name is, that ruled his tariffs invalid.
687
July 9th is going to be here pretty soon.
688
And that's the day when his 90-day extension on the...
689
I'm sorry, is it July 9th or July 2nd?
690
I forget, but regardless, it's going to be here soon.
691
First week of July.
692
First week of August.
693
We'll say that for now.
694
Thank you.
695
When his 90-day extension is going to expire.
696
And I'm wondering how companies and traders are going to approach that and when they're going to start incorporating that into their strategies and models.
697
Because I guess if I'm Trump, I'd probably wait until the very last moment to have an extension, saying right up until then, no, no, no, they're going back into effect.
698
But they're dismissing it.
699
They're looking through it.
700
Taco trade, right?
701
It's the taco trade.
702
Trump always chickens out.
703
That's all it is.
704
I get that, but, he made such a big deal about this.
705, do you think he can really just say another 90-day extension?
706
He's too proud, I think, to do something that as much as I do tacos.
707
So I'm going to go ahead and do that.
708
The burrito trade is the opposite of the taco trade.
709
The burrito trade is the overreaction that Trump would have in response to the name of the taco trade.
710
The biggest taco trade.
711
Did you see his response to the reporter asking about it?
712
He was, I was, oh my God, just asking about that might have made global trade worse.
713
Don't bring up the taco.
714
Don't bring up taco.
715
Just X Nay on Taco.
716
Yeah.
717
So yeah, that's what I'm, those are the things I slow walking this, right?
718
Japan's slow walking this.
719
Eurozone's slow walking.
720
Then the Eurozone suddenly started trying to move faster, but how do you do that?
721
They have so many different member countries with differing goals and different agendas.
722
China's slow walking it.
723
They're all slow walking it.
724
And Trump has shown his hand.
725
And so everyone's shown their hand here.
726
They're, yeah, we want to get deals done.
727
And they've chosen to embrace markets, which is great.
728
I'm glad they chose to embrace markets.
729
Glad they want to get deals done.
730
That's the very message for the markets.
731
Yeah,, Trump jumped when the bond market,, what do you call it?
732
Yip, the yips in the bond market.
733
And, yeah, yeah, it's, it's just all he needs to do is show progress and be, oh, we're making progress.
734
We highlight certain parts of the deal and agreements they've come to.
735
And it doesn't have to be in anything in writing.
736
And he can say face.
737, he's very good at making things, at least to his base, and to certain people that he's doing exactly what he's saying to him if he isn't.
738
And that's what I assume that's what he's going to do.
739
And it's going to be more taco side than burritos.
740
One data point to share with you.
741
Also, in Trump Trade Poor 1.0, which was Q4 2018, again, you had a 19-20% drawdown in the major indices, and then you had a sharp, furious rally you're seeing now in Q1 2019.
742
However, in Q2 2019, you had another mini correction due to a renewal of tariff war back and forth with China.
743
So those scenarios are there.
744
Don't be complacent, especially now, probably.
745
I wouldn't be complacent now because on the 16th, the corporate buybacks stop.
746
And now you're in the middle of the month.
747
The seasonality is not as favorable.
748
And you're probably going to set up for more breath expansion rather than more expansion of technology things.
749
All right, Sal.
750
What's your macro take?
751, you have it from both sides, right?
752
You're seeing a bunch of deals and you are trying to raise money.
753
So you have a little unique insight that I guess RO sees a little bit because he's always trying to raise money as the wealth management side of things.
754
But what's your macro take?
755
Yeah,, I'm aligned in certain regards.
756
I'll pick up at where Ron left off.
757, we have what we're looking at, no more than 30 days until the end of this period ever runs slow rolling.
758
I think the volatility bans that we would see following either an aggressive reaction from Trump, which I think is more likely.
759
I don't think he's going to roll over and push out another 90 days here.
760
But I think the impact on markets would be less than the drawback that we saw in April.
761
I'm more interested to see how employment data shakes out over the next 60 to 90 days.
762
It'll be an indicator of where and when we start to see any expectation of the dot plot coming towards more favorable rates.
763
I'm in a not-complacent, patient-waiting key mode.
764
And I think the second half of June is going to be quite telling.
765
Yeah.
766
All right.
767
So that's it for macro.
768
I guess.
769
Anyone have any last-minute macro things before we jump on to two really quick talkets and wrap up?
770
Go ahead, Steve.
771
Just one quick small thing because then I have to drop.
772
But my last answer, I was talking about April inflation data.
773
May.
774
So I just wanted to make that one quick clarification.
775
I'm not sure if anyone else caught that, but I wanted to, I didn't catch it.
776
So I only hope that makes you feel better.
777
Anyway, thanks everybody for watching and listening.
778
And I'll drop off now.
779
All right.
780
Thanks, Steve.
781
All right.
782
Yeah.
783
Let's be real quick here.
784
Let's get a quick take from Sal mostly because Ram and I have talked about our views on this topic a lot.
785
But really, it's just treasury companies, Bitcoin Treasury mostly, but also subaltins.
786
I'm curious to hear what you think, Sal.
787
But, just some stats here.
788, strategy just did another billion dollars essentially for purchases.
789
Meta Planet did a $5 billion stock rights program and surged 22%.
790
So MetaPlanet out of Japan is doing extremely well.
791
And then also,, if you just look, I'm on Twitter, obviously, and I see, I feel every day I'm hearing a new company buying Bitcoin for the strategy or entering a new treasury strategy where they issue debt to get erase capital to buy Bitcoin, or somebody who's already been doing it a little bit is leaning further into it.
792
So, here's some stats from this account I follow on Twitter, who's, but I started following in the Bitcoin ETF race, but from June 2nd to June 6th alone, he has 42 updates on this exact topic.
793
16 new treasuries added.
794
So, that's new companies doing this just in the one week.
795
16 companies added Bitcoin, totaling 4.4,000 Bitcoin, 4.5,000 Bitcoin almost.
796
11 companies announced for future purchases worth billions of dollars, including four that haven't officially launched yet.
797
So,, there's that's 42 updates of these different companies that are doing all this different stuff.
798
Obviously, the big dogs are strategy and meta planet and some others that are come 21 is coming to market.
799
But I'm curious, Sal, from your point of view, what do you think of all these things?
800
Because again, Rob and I have talked about this a bunch, but this you I feel we couldn't not wrap at least talk about this a little bit on the show today with all the announcements we've seen.
801
Yeah, there's three points in my mind on this.
802, point one is, and you've seen murmurs on this on X, but at some point there is a break in a supply shock, and we've been monitoring Bitcoin held on exchanges, which has plummeted in recent weeks and probably will only accelerate if this momentum continues.
803
We know what that looks.
804
We've all seen blow-off tops in this space.
805
Candidly, outside of the rally around the election period, we really haven't seen the type of velocity and price movement that we have in prior cycles, probably because of scale and the nature of capital participating in the market today as compared to 21 or 2017.
806
But I do think at some point this sets the stage for a pretty aggressive move.
807
The flip side of which is,, a back of my mind, concern around buildup of systemic risk over leverage in this space and feeling point one is too good to be true and relies on certain types of assumptions with relation to duration and time hold,, time on maturity and debt obligations.
808
So, as I see the really strong momentum, it always gives me a little bit of concern.
809
And then the third point I've seen is just the emulation down the ladder.
810
All the majors are moving towards a public company digital asset treasury structure.
811
You saw what happened with the Ethereum iteration.
812
We've already seen Sol Strategies go.
813
I know of several others that are taking similar types of approaches and in assets that have different characteristics in terms of mechanic design and inflation assumptions behind them.
814
So I don't think the trend is going to stop anytime soon.
815
I'm hopeful that we don't end up in a position where we have a buildup and a break, but it's been pretty remarkable.
816
Don't be long.
817
If you're long Bitcoin, though, I would stay along now, just tactically.
818
Q4, I think, is a bit of a different story.
819
And maybe even mid-July, Bitcoin is just flirting with all-time highs right now.
820
That capital is going to go by Bitcoin.
821
If there's less Bitcoin on exchanges, then Bitcoin is more sensitive to that incremental bid,, as.
822
So it's a,, by the way, fun fact.
823
I read that Michael Saylor's average purchase point for Bitcoin is now higher than the 21 peak in Bitcoin.
824
Yeah, it's 70K now after yesterday's purchase.
825
Okay now, there you go.
826
So, yeah, I think Bitcoin's long chaos, too.
827
A lot of chaos out there, right?
828
Yeah.
829
I made a comment last time.
830, I was taken aback by the depth of the retracement that we saw post,, Liberation Day.
831
I don't think we're going to see that type of retracement again, even if trade wars flare up,, coming first week of July.
832
So I'm going to ground on this.
833, I would be patient and stay long because I think the likelihood that we see a blow-off move upwards is far higher than what we see on the downside and probably of a greater percentage change in price.
834
So yeah, funding rates aren't elevated now.
835
There's no sign of euphoria.
836
And retail is still relatively absent as compared to 21.
837 it's just not the same composition of capital that it was.
838
And a lot of these institutional long-duration bias investors are diversifying into retirement positions,, taking a five to ten year view.
839
It's just different today.
840
I do think Ethereum is very interesting here, though, because that's less crowded and the narrative of a micro strategy for Ethereum or multiple coming online can do really well.
841
It's a nice catch-up trade.
842
I think Bitcoin and Ethereum are both very interesting stories here.
843
Yeah, I would say the only I agree with everything you guys are saying.
844
I think getting really low levels of Bitcoin on exchange can lead to those blow-offs off.
845
It'll make the incremental dollar, as you said, could,, impact prices a little more.
846
But I would also say in the commodity world, the saying is the cure for high prices is high prices because more supply will come online.
847
Though Bitcoin is obviously different, right?
848
So in the commodity world, if you're growing wheat or soybeans or whatever and price are really high, farmers and people will spend more money to grow that crop and take advantage of those high prices.
849
Eventually, as more supply comes online, price comes down.
850
The thing with Bitcoin now, especially with the mining subsidy so far down, is that new supply is going to come from people selling their Bitcoin.
851
It's not going to be from new Bitcoin created necessarily.
852
But I do think higher prices is going to create more sellers and people are going to bring their money to their Bitcoin to exchange to sell.
853
So I do discount a little bit of it.
854
I don't think we're going to be in the same level of blow off top just because the amount of capital you need to move these markets around.
855
Though it is obviously at the incremental side of things.
856
And we still have positive news to look forward to in terms of congressional action exchanges coming online.
857
My approach to Bitcoin now is I'm focused on off-grid Bitcoin mining through operators that are using cheap, free natural gas and they're using that to mine Bitcoin.
858
So that's my angle.
859
It's I don't paying retail for my Bitcoin.
860
I finding a nice discount to that.
861
So that's my approach here at this stage in the cycle.
862
Nice.
863
All right.
864
I'm just going to read all some stats about the ETFs and then we'll wrap up.
865
I don't know if you guys have any thoughts on the treasury side of things or Bitcoin pricing.
866
All right.
867
So real quick, the Ethereum ETFs now are nearing in on $3.5 billion in net inflows.
868
They had a billion dollars in outflows in that retracement you were just talking about, Sal.
869
They've almost taken all of it back.
870
They're at 850 million in inflows, tons of consecutive days and weeks of inflows.
871
The Bitcoin ETFs have way more than retraced their outflows.
872
IBIT is now a $70 billion fund.
873
It's one of the top 25 largest funds in the U.S.
874
It is the fastest to 70 billion by an order of magnitude.
875
It did it in 341 days.
876
The next fastest is over 2,000 days, I think.
877
Stat courtesy of my boss, Eric Balchunis.
878
But the growth here is just absolutely insane.
879
So that's the first thing I want to say.
880
Just those ETFs are doing exceptionally well.
881
The other thing is Trump, TrueSolcial, filed for a Bitcoin ETF.
882
That officially went through to the exchange.
883
They filed on S1.
884
So TrueSol is launching a Bitcoin ETF.
885
The final deadline will be sometime in February.
886
My assumption is it will probably not have to take that long to get launched.
887
Yeah, those are the main key things.
888
And I said earlier in the show, we're going to see basket ETFs likely get approved in early July.
889
I think there's a decent chance that we could see some altcoin ETFs, Solana, XRP, Litecoin, potentially those types of names approved in that time range too.
890
Is Maker?
891
There is no maker filing.
892
So how do we get a maker file?
893
We got to call Vance.
894
We're going to get Vance on the show here, by the way, from Framework, people behind the Ethereum and Maker ecosystem.
895
That'd be fun.
896
Yeah, get more in the weeds.
897
All right.
898
Any comments on that, guys?
899
Man, it's just wild.
900
Most successful financial product launches ever.
901
I love to see the flows on the ETH side.
902
I think it sets up really nicely with what happened with SBAT.
903
I think Ethereum is still mispriced.
904
So I'm excited to see where that goes.
905
Last time I was here, I was saying it's a setup for a short squeeze.
906
Sentiment was at all-time lows.
907
You've seen major changes at the foundation, governance, communication, new personnel in place, a lot of chatter that's more positive today.
908
And I think the institutional flows on the ETF side are reflective of that.
909
So excited to see where that one moves.
910
Yeah, look, I think it's exciting.
911
Look, stablecoins are here.
912
You're seeing TrashFi try to get their head around this.
913
They haven't used stablecoins as a customer yet.
914
Now they're forced to reckon with it.
915
At the same time, they see a bill that's going to advance stablecoin legislation.
916
So it's a there's a gestalt shift happening in markets.
917
You've seen Visa and MasterCard stock prices are down one point today, down more than XLF.
918
So it's more than just beta exposure.
919
Look, I know that's a drop in the bucket.
920
But someone out there said, gee, maybe there's some risk for these legacy payment intermediaries or networks.
921
There's a lot of stuff happening, man.
922
It's really exciting.
923
And, you guys, the money pouring into these things is just crazy.
924
Anyone who's completely doubted this space back in 2016 needs to do a complete rehash of what their thought process was.
925
And I'm telling you right now, a lot of people on Wall Street still have the same views they had in 2017.
926 they have not readjusted at all.
927
Jim Chanos is shorting micro strategies still.
928
He'll be right in Q425 after he's liquidated and creating the bid on the way out.
929
Right?
930
All right.
931
That's what we're going to end the show on.
932
Rob calling out Jim Chanos.
933
All right.
934
Thanks for joining us for this episode of Bits and Bips.
935
So thank you to all you guys on the live stream.
936
And also thank you to anyone watching this later on YouTube or wherever you listen to the podcast.
937
We'll be back in one week to discuss more about how the worlds of crypto and macro are colliding.
938
Until then, everyone.
