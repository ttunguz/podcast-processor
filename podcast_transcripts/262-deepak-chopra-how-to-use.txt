1
Either we adapt to new technologies or we become extinct.
2
There's no choice.
3
And like any technology, it has both divine and diabolic applications.
4
AI can't give you the experience, but AI can create a map for you to go your route that you want to.
5
So there's nothing behind consciousness.
6
It's fundamental, it's without cause, it's outside of space-time, it is spaceless, it is timeless, it is infinite, it is beyond imagination, it is incomprehensible.
7
Spiritual awakening is to go beyond all human constructs and know your fundamental identity as what spiritual traditions call the soul or the spirit.
8
But let's just call it consciousness or awareness without any human construct.
9
Building multi-agent software is hard.
10
Agent-to-agent and agent-to-tool communication is still the wild west.
11
How do you achieve accuracy and consistency in non-deterministic agentic apps?
12
That's where agency, AGNTCY, comes in.
13
The agency is an open source collective building the internet of agents.
14
And what's the internet of agents?
15
It's a collaboration layer where AI agents can communicate, discover each other, and work across frameworks.
16
For developers, this means standardized agent discovery tools, seamless protocols for interagent communication, and modular components to compose and scale multi-agent workflows.
17
Build with other engineers who care about high-quality multi-agent software.

21
Deepak, if you could introduce yourself to listeners.
22
My name is Deepak Chopra.
23
I'm a medical doctor trained as a neuroendocrinologist who got interested in integrative medicine.
24
I have written about 96 books.
25
My newest book is Digital Dharma: How to Use AI for Well-Being and Spiritual Inclusions.
26
I have my own AI, which is called Deepak Chopra.ai, which is a health coach and a spiritual coach with me as being the coach.
27
And it's available in four languages now: English, Hindi, Arabic, and Spanish.
28
And I'm engaged mostly in writing books.
29
I'm licensed to practice medicine in three states in California.
30
I'm an adjunct professor at the University of California, San Diego, and Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, and also University of Central Florida, where I teach medical students about integrative medicine.
31
Well, you're one of those guys that are busier than I am, and I'm always perplexed at how somebody can do all those things at once and write a book.
32
Actually, I've got to ask you right away: did you use any AI in the writing of the book?
33
So far, I haven't.
34
On digital dharma, I wrote 90% of the book myself, and then the 10% I told readers how to use prompts.
35
For that, I used the, you know, to give some examples of how to use the prompts.
36
Yeah.
37
Let's start with the AI revolution.
38
I mean, you've written a lot about, you know, health and well-being and spiritual well-being.
39
A lot of people see artificial intelligence as dehumanizing or replacing human connection and see it as a threat to spiritual well-being as a result.
40
You've embraced it.
41
Can you talk at all?
42
I mean, we all know that young people in particular are suffering from digital addiction and the problems that come with too much exposure to social media, particularly for adolescents.
43
But you've embraced this.
44
Is it because you see it, artificial intelligence and particularly the generative AI that's been around now for three or four years as different and useful?
45
Or is it simply we can't fight progress, so figure out how to make the most of it?
46
Craig, let's just delve a little bit into human history.
47
So about 40,000 years ago, humans, Homo sapiens, took a different route from all other species in that we started to use language to communicate with each other.
48
All biological organisms have a language for three things.
49
One is mating calls.
50
The second is danger calls.
51
And the third is food calls, food.
52
So that's how we work along with other species.
53
But then 40,000 years ago, plus minus a few decades or centuries, we learned how to communicate the way we are communicating right now in terms of narrative and story.
54
And then over tens of thousands of years, we actually improved our language models in the sense that we created not only narrative language, but language for biology, language for physics, language for mathematics, language for chemistry, language for astronomy, language for philosophy, language for religion, language for spirituality.
55
So with the current models that we have, we have access to what it says, multiple languages, large language models, and therefore we have access.
56
Any single human being now has access to the entire database and knowledge and even wisdom of all of humanity combined.
57
No human being that can come close to it.
58
At the same time, AI is built on algorithms.
59
You know, I like to think of AI as extended human intelligence.
60
And even there, it has selection bias because after all, it's programmed by human beings.
61
Nevertheless, it's the best instrument we have to tap into the wisdom of the ages and also the health span, longevity.
62
So when I wrote my book and also when I created the AI, I focused only on health span, longevity, well-being, physical, emotional, spiritual, and spiritual intelligence.
63
So my AI is not a large language model.
64
And what I found is actually young people are very comfortable using it because they don't feel judged.
65
And my AI is personal AI.
66
It's got my voice, it's got my.
67
And so, you know, they feel very much engaged.
68
And I agree with you that we are in a very critical time.
69
You say general models have been around for three, four years.
70
But AI as a large language model has only been around since the year 2012.
71
So it's not even 20 years.
72
And either we adapt to new technologies or we become extinct.
73
There's no choice.
74
And like any technology, it has both divine and diabolical applications.
75
So you can use AI literally to cause human extinction, if you know how to use it.
76
Or you can use AI to create a better world, a healthier world, a more joyful world, more sustainable world, a more just world.
77
That's my dream.
78
So when I started this project, I engaged with Sam Altman and OpenAI.
79
And I said, is it worth trying to use AI for health, well-being, and reaching a critical mass for well-being and spiritual enlightenment?
80
And he was totally enthusiastic about the idea.
81
And that's how it came about.
82
And the training, you're fine-tuning a base model, is that right, for Deepak Chopra.ai?
83
The training is entirely through my team, not through ChatGPT or any of the others.
84
So it's not a large language model.
85
It's a small language model.
86
It doesn't hallucinate and it's very personal.
87
It gets you and me engaging.
88
Right now, for example, even this conversation will be fed into my AI to generate new applications.
89
It also has what we call the RAG model, regenerative augmentation generation.
90
So we stay current.
91
Yeah.
92
You know, I've been talking to he's Indian actually, the head of the tech practice at Boston Consulting Group for North America.
93
And he has this fascinating idea of doing what you've done, but training the model on all of the religious texts of the world.
94
The original texts, not the commentaries and interpretations and all of that.
95
Do you have you done anything like that?
96
I have.
97
So, you know, what I do is, by the way, you can get commentaries of the original texts on any AI.
98
You know, you can go to PubLection Chat GPT.
99
And I think those are very good, by the way.
100
What the material there on religion, spirituality, philosophy is very good.
101
What they don't do is, which I'm attempting to do, is say, okay, you know, if Jesus Christ and the Buddha and I met together and I had the opportunity to ask them questions, how would it go?
102
And at the end of this, I'll send you three videos that I just produced through AI, three conversations with the Buddha on the nature of reality, enlightenment, etc.
103
But now I'm expanding that.
104
I can do that with the Kabbalah.
105
I can do that, you know, Judaic and and Vedic cognition, etc.
106
And that's a very creative way to show the commonality of spiritual experience how did you know if there's one thing in common or two three things in common spiritual experience not I'm not talking about dogma or philosophy but the experience there are three things one is transcendence the second is the loss of the fear of death and the third is the emergence of platonic values like truth goodness beauty harmony love compassion joy equanimity so i asked myself how can we maximize that experience for everyone else ai can't give you the experience but yeah i can create a map for you to go your route that you want to you know they there are many maps for me to go from new york to say even boston i can take a road map i can take a contour map i can go by air i can go by ship etc i can go by a helicopter so each of us has different routes to the same destination but then you look at the comparison in these routes and you realize that all these different traditions ended up in the same destination although they took different cultural and mythological pathways to it you know yeah that's uh that's interesting although one thing i probably the only thing i learned in college is that meaning lies in difference, not in similarity.
107
And so, what interests me is where those religious traditions would differ or where they would contradict each other.
108
And that too can be done, which is, I'm not doing that right now where they contradict each other.
109
I'm saying where do they agree so we can have some reconciliation in the turbulence of the world, which is all about dogma right now, religion, dogma, and different ways of looking at the same situation.
110
So, if we want to bring more peace conflict resolution, it's important to focus on the commonalities as well.
111
Yeah.
112
There was a guy at the very early on during, you know, AI went through the supervised learning phase.
113
I mean, it's still a big part of AI, but before generative AI, just pattern matching.
114
And there was a lot of enthusiasm among the AI community.
115
It hadn't really penetrated the public consciousness yet.
116
But there was a guy who created a church of AI.
117
I don't know what happened to it, but I saw that.
118
And you are Harari is also talking about, you know, the church of AI, etc.
119
This will evolve ultimately.
120
Yeah, well, it's interesting because, I mean, we're so early days, but you have your AI.
121
I actually have my AI.
122
I haven't put it out to the public yet, but eventually we're all going to have a digital twin and it'll help us explore for those that want to explore some of these issues, some of the religious traditions that people follow.
123
And I mean, there's already a decline in religiosity or organized religion, at least in industrialized countries.
124
And you can imagine that the day will come when traditional religion is kind of this archaic artifact.
125
But as you said, the convergence of all of this human exploration, spiritual exploration, is codified in AI, and AI becomes the spiritual leader or the religion, so to speak, for people.
126
I mean, have you looked into the future and imagined that?
127
Yes, I think we could call it spiritual experience rather than religious dogma, and we can draw the best from all traditions.
128
But, you know, as we speak to you, and a lot of people watching us, I'm sure there is more interest right now in health span, longevity, prevention of disease, reversal of disease, things like that.
129
And although the information is available on the internet on through various AIs, what I'm focused on, just as you mentioned, you have your digital twin.
130
I'm now engaging and helping actually other physicians create their own digital twins.
131
So I'm working with a physician surgeon in Mount Sinai who's an expert on men's health, another who's an expert on cancer, another who's an expert on mental well-being.
132
And then we all have these twins and we create an ecosystem of these digital twins that do grand rounds.
133
You know, like when I was an active physician, when we had difficult patients, difficult means difficult to treat.
134
It seemed to be almost no one knew what to do with them.
135
Then, you know, once a week we all got together from different specialties and we tried to solve the issue, the difficult diagnosis or treatment or etc.
136
And invariably when you brought together a lot of experts together and you had them give their point of view, somehow a solution emerged.
137
So right now what I'm doing is creating an ecosystem of digital twins that will talk to each other.
138
So you say Craig or somebody, Stephen, says, I have diabetes, I'm 44 years old, I've tried this, this medication, it hasn't helped me.
139
And could you help me?
140
So then these digital twins get together and they actually look at your problem in a unique way, in a way that regular AI doesn't do right now, you know, because I have diabetes, I'm dealing with this cancer.
141
The normal AI will not ask you how your marriage is going along, or are you stressed about your finances, or do you have a problem with your kids, or how do you sleep?
142
You know, these are the things that are missing right now in the holistic management of chronic disease.
143
We now know that only 5% of chronic disease is fully predictable through gene mutations.
144
The rest, 95%, is what we call epigenetic, influenced by lifestyle.
145
And unless you go deeply into the history of a patient, which a normal doctor doesn't have time to do, and even AI doesn't do, it doesn't ask you about your life, about your social interactions, about your marriage, about your children, about so many things.
146
You know, every day we go through eating, breathing, digestion, metabolism, elimination, sensory experience, emotions, thoughts, desires, memories.
147
So all of that contributes to our well-being.
148
And I believe that the future of well-being can be very personal, very predictive, very preventable.
149
And along with your participation, we can probably handle more than 95% of all issues, medical and psychological and mental.
150
That's where it's going to go anyway.
151
So I thought, let me embark on that.
152
You know, I also know on my I am in the process of putting these digital devices, these variables that can correlate your question, your lifestyle with what's happening with your heart rate, your blood pressure, all of that.
153
So we're looking at a very interesting future.
154
Yeah, yeah, the wearables is a fascinating data.
155
It hasn't really developed to the degree that it could, but even at the current, you know, being able to track blood oxygen, for example, or heart rate.
156
Let's talk about the book.
157
You talk about, for example, the art of the prompt.
158
I mean, there is an art to working with AI.
159
And there are a lot of prompt lists out there.
160
But my experience is you really need to engage on a daily basis to begin to understand what works and what doesn't work, and what's a good response and what's a weak response.
161
Can you talk about that?
162
About how do you teach the art of the prompt?
163
Can you?
164
Yes, so you know, you're very right that it takes you have to engage with it daily to get into how to master the art of the prompt.
165
You start with a generic question, and then when you get an answer and you're not happy with that, you say, Can you actually reframe your answer in terms of spirituality or in terms of epigenetics or whatever?
166
And then you start engaging with it in a conversation.
167
And ultimately, actually, what is so interesting about these generative AI is you can finally get it to engage with you in a way which is non-confrontational, but leads to a creative insight, both for you and you realize that the AI doesn't have a fixed mind.
168
You know, the prompts, when you use the prompts in an intelligent way, you actually become much more creative.
169
You know, the other day, Oscar-winning director called me a few months ago when AI just was coming and there was a strike going on and all of that.
170
And he said, you know, it seems like my chef will be able to write a better screenplay than I do.
171
And I said, that's not true.
172
He'll be able to write a better recipe than you can.
173
But only you with your experience will know how to use the AI for screenplays better than your chef.
174
He'll know how to use it better than for cooking meals, so developing better cuisine.
175
So actually, it makes us more creative and it helps us.
176
And the more experience we have in our field, it enhances our creativity and our imagination.
177
Yeah.
178
So, you know, active engagement is important uh the the um in the book you talk about and i have to confess i haven't read the book so i'm reading uh a summary ai summary uh you can just go to my yeah and ask it any question without reading the book now i did but i hit the paywall which i was a little disappointed by so let me tell you about the paywall yeah so it costs us three to five cents to answer the questions yeah so what we have is you know up to a certain amount it's free and then you know we have to cover our costs yeah so that that that's where the paywall comes and now we've created something called super tab so you can run a tab and you pay when you can you know you don't you can just say run me a tab for five dollars right right i see yeah i i didn't explore and i saw that the price is is minimal it just it was uh after point you have to pay for the service right yeah yeah but uh but but you were talking about um in the book again uh how ai can help unravel the mysteries of consciousness uh and that's something i wanted to talk to you about i know you've you have this uh quantum uh explanation or quantum theory of consciousness uh that's that a lot of physicists and quantum physicists have been critical of uh i had recently a guy named stuart hameroff.
179
He's an anesthesiologist.
180
Oh, is that right?
181
He's a fascinating guy.
182
I haven't had Stuart Penrose on partly because I'm not sure.
183
I could manage the conversation.
184
But Stuart was wonderful talking about the potential of a quantum connection through the micro tubules and neurons in the brain between the physical construct of the brain and the immaterial construct of consciousness.
185
Where do you stand on that?
186
Do you believe, and I was actually asking your digital twin this, this is, I couldn't get a straight answer, to be honest, as to whether or not you believe consciousness is an emergent property of the physical biology or whether there is a separate but related paranormal, para, you know, non-physical realm in which consciousness exists.
187
Yeah, I'm just, you've certainly thought about all these things, so I'm interested.
188
So here we are.
189
You know, those who criticize me for my quantum models actually haven't read or watched my videos on YouTube on these matters.
190
They just are dismissive because I use the word quantum and I'm not a quantum physicist.
191
I have never claimed, never claimed that quantum mechanics is the key to consciousness.
192
Quantum mechanics is a model that explains experience in consciousness.
193
So when you say is it an emergent property?
194
The answer is no.
195
Matter is an emergent property and matter is actually doesn't exist.
196
It's a human construct.
197
So when you say matter, you know, let's pick up anything that is material right now.
198
Let me pick up my iPhone.
199
Okay, so this is a piece of matter, right?
200
But how do I know what this is?
201
Not through physics, not through biology.
202
I know it through a direct experience, which is sensation, which is color, which could be sound, which could be taste or smell.
203
So the way I know any object is through my five senses, which in turn are activities in what we call perception.
204
And perception is an activity in consciousness.
205
So everything that we call matter is actually a human construct for a perceptual activity in consciousness.
206
Now you say, where is this consciousness?
207
If it's not emergent, where is it?
208
And the simplest answer is it's not in space and time.
209
And the reason it's not in space and time is it doesn't have a form.
210
If your consciousness had a form, you'd be able to see it or touch it.
211
Okay?
212
But you can't.
213
So it doesn't have a form and doesn't have a border.
214
So it's infinite and it's spaceless and it's timeless and it's outside of space-time.
215
This is a very mind-boggling idea that people who are watching this program or listening to this conversation think this experience is happening in their brain.
216
But there is no sound in the brain.
217
There's no color red of the spectacles they're wearing in your brain.
218
There is nothing that you can call experience in your brain.
219
All there is in the brain are what are called neural correlates of consciousness, which means they are the electrochemical activity that corresponds to sensations, images, feelings, and thoughts.
220
But the brain doesn't have any sensation, image, feeling, or thought.
221
In fact, if you put a knife through the brain, the brain can't experience its own experience.
222
The brain doesn't have any experience.
223
It's a computer that correlates experiences with electrochemicals.
224
And the electrochemicals are also an experience in consciousness.
225
So there's nothing behind consciousness.
226
It's fundamental.
227
It's without cause.
228
It's outside of space-time.
229
It is spaceless.
230
It is timeless.
231
It is infinite.
232
It is beyond imagination.
233
It is incomprehensible.
234
And everything that we'd call technology or quantum mechanics is a model, mathematical model to predict the outcomes of experiments.
235
No more, no less.
236
So, on a deeper level, I mean, you know, Stuart's a great friend of mine, Sir Roger Penrose is a Nobel laureate.
237
What they're saying is also misunderstood.
238
So, you know, if I, let's say, take an analogy, the analogy is electricity.
239
Okay, and so that electrical field is powering my phone, it's powering my devices, it's powering my light bulb, it's powering my TV set, the microwave oven in my kitchen, and all the devices I have here.
240
Now, if my device shuts off, let's say the light bulb fuses, that doesn't do anything to the electricity.
241
Okay, the electricity is there, and all the information that electricity is capable of expressing through various devices is also there.
242
So, your brain is a particular device that consciousness uses to have a human experience and only a human experience.
243
What you call the physical world is also a human construct for human experience.
244
A bat would not be experiencing right now what you and I are experiencing because it experiences the echo of ultrasound.
245
A bird navigates through ultraviolet.
246
An insect with a hundred eyes, I don't know what it sees.
247
So, where I'm coming from is consciousness is fundamental, and actually, there is no physical universe.
248
There's no such thing as a physical body or a physical brain or DNA or genetic material.
249
These are symbols for modes of knowing and experience in consciousness that humans have given names to, just like we give a name to latitude, longitude, Greenwich mean time, dollar, yen.
250
These are all human constructs without which, by the way, life would be impossible.
251
If you didn't have latitude, longitude, Greenwich mean time, you wouldn't be able to take a plane from New York to Botswana.
252
But the fact is, we made it up.
253
The Greenwich mean time is not Botswana meantime, it's Greenwich meantime.
254
Latitude and longitude are human constructs.
255
Botswana is a name for a particular experience.
256
So, is New York a human name for a particular experience?
257
Once we get this, we'll solve the heart problem of consciousness.
258
But nobody is listening because they're all so interested in their models of reality and they confuse the models of reality with reality.
259
Reality is incomprehensible, incomprehensible.
260
You know, if you go on the internet right now and say, What are the 125 open questions in science?
261
The first open question is, What's the universe made of?
262
And the shortest answer is made of nothing.
263
Then, the second open question is, What's the biological basis of consciousness?
264
It's the wrong question.
265
There's no biological basis of consciousness.
266
Consciousness, biology is an experience in consciousness.
267
How do you know there's a brain?
268
What is it that knows the brain?
269
What is it that knows the body?
270
What is it that knows emotions?
271
What is it that knows AI?
272
Nobody's asking it, you know, we experience the world.
273
What we call the world is our five senses.
274
But there's something that knows the five senses, the mind.
275
And there's something that knows the mind, it's consciousness.
276
Now, this is my take on it.
277
And, you know, all those critics talking about, you know, he's talking nonsense, quantum mechanics, etc.
278
I'm not saying quantum mechanics can explain consciousness.
279
What I'm saying is nothing can explain consciousness because it is outside of space-time.
280
This conversation you and I are having is being computed outside of space-time.
281
Now, that's a mind-boggling idea, and people are not ready to accept it, although right now the conversation is emerging in that direction.
282
Simulation, that the world we live in is a simulation.
283
And that is where AI comes in because AI will extend.
284
AI is not where it is going to be now.
285
With VR, with XR, with MR, with immersive experiences, you'll be extending the range of your experience to the point where you'll be able to experience the world through the nervous system of a bat or a bird or an insect with a hundred eyes or a dolphin.
286
You know, because technology is actually proving what I've been saying for a while, that the physical world is actually a simulation, it's a perceptual activity, it's a human construct for sensations, images, feelings, and thoughts.
287
So, I got it out of my system.
288
I'm not creating a new model for consciousness.
289
You can create models of consciousness, but consciousness is ultimately not computable.
290
Never be conscious in that sense.
291
It doesn't feel hunger or have sexual urge or fear death or have existential problems.
292
You can simulate all that, but we are only a simulation.
293
Yeah, it's an interesting idea.
294
I mean, the one thing about I mean, a couple of things come to mind.
295
I interviewed Albert Hoffman before his death, Albert Hoffman, the guy who synthesized LSD 25.
296
And I was at his home in Bern, Switzerland, up on a mountaintop.
297
And he was talking about how beautiful the world is, but that it all exists in your mind, that there is no color.
298
You know, the color is a color, not a property of the physical world, nor is sound a property of the physical world, nor is texture, nor is fragrance, nor is you know what we call taste.
299
These are subjective qualia in consciousness and not properties of the physical world.
300
So we navigate something called a physical world, but all the time it's a controlled hallucination.
301
Yeah, and something else I've read recently, and I'm slowly getting interested in quantum mechanics.
302
I was listening to somebody talk about the collapse of the wave function, which I won't get into, but it's, you know, there are multiple possible states and when you, in perception, collapses them to a single state, right?
303
That's a simple way to describe it.
304
Epic perception is a snapshot of infinite possibilities.
305
That's right.
306
But the explanation I heard, which really made sense to me, is that we are surrounded by radio waves.
307
We don't perceive them.
308
But if you have a receiver and you tune it, you can tune it to one frequency and you can hear that frequency.
309
You don't hear all the other frequencies.
310
And that the wave function is like that.
311
There are all these possible worlds.
312
We're tuned to one possible world.
313
So those watching us are tuned into this.
314
There are other people watching, you know, white lotus or something.
315
And that's not part of our reality at the moment.
316
Yeah, it's a fascinating idea.
317
However, when you were saying that, you know, the physical world is a manifestation of our perception, you held up the iPhone or AI.
318
We're able to manipulate something outside of ourselves, the physical world, to create technology that can give an experience that's shared across all humanity.
319
So there is something outside of our perception that we're able to physically manipulate, you know, whatever you want to call that.
320
It's not only consciousness.
321
We have the ability to manipulate the simulation through our technology.
322
And what we call the laws of nature are the regularities of experience in consciousness.
323
That's all they are.
324
So we objectify the regularities of experience as the laws of nature.
325
The sun rises every day, it closes every day, and based on where we are, our premise is that the earth is spinning on its axis, it's going around the sun, but that's only from this location.
326
Okay, so all these things are very relative and they are actually useful to codify into constructs.
327
And those constructs are what we call the laws of nature.
328
But we actually codify them, okay, just like we codified money.
329
I mean, there was no such thing, and yet it runs the world right now.
330
Okay, the money is a human concept.
331
Nation states are a human concept.
332
Colonialism is a human concept.
333
Everything that you can give a name to is a concept because otherwise that's what a name is.
334
It's a concept.
335
So ultimately, everything is a concept, but the source of all these concepts is what we call pure consciousness.
336
Now, the quantum model is very interesting because it simulates how the mind works.
337
Before you have a thought, it's in superposition with infinite thoughts.
338
Okay, you can jump from one thought to another thought.
339
I say think of the empire state building, now think of your mother.
340
There's no connection, but you move from here to here instantly.
341
That's like, you know, quantum tunneling or quantum leaks.
342
Then there's the uncertainty principle.
343
You don't know what the next space-time event will be, only you can predict it with Schoder's equation, the statistical likelihood.
344
Same thing with your thoughts.
345
If I asked you, what's your next thought going to be?
346
You have no idea.
347
Okay, so the mind is modeling the principles of quantum mechanics, but neither the mind nor quantum mechanics is reality.
348
Reality is just pure consciousness.
349
Yeah.
350
You talk about the limitations of AI, that it certainly lacks consciousness for the reasons that you've just given, and it lacks general, I'm sorry, genuine spiritual wisdom.
351
Are you saying that things like empathy are qualities of this infinite consciousness that we are channeling as individual entities.
352
Empathy is entanglement, similar to quantum entanglement.
353
You know, when you have a, you look at a child and you hurt a dog or a cat or whatever, the child winces and cries because it feels viscerally the pain of another.
354
So it's a natural phenomenon for consciousness.
355
After we get bamboozled by social constructs, we lose that.
356
But, you know, mammals particularly are naturally empathetic, not just human beings.
357
Monkeys and elephants and giraffes and all mammals have empathy for their kind, but even for other species.
358
You can have a relationship with your dog or with your cat, etc.
359
And the cat can also read your moods and knows how to, or the dog.
360
I mean, there's lots of evidence of that.
361
So empathy is a property of consciousness.
362
So is compassion.
363
So is love.
364
So is joy.
365
So is kindness.
366
These are evolutionary qualities of consciousness.
367
Now, can they be simulated?
368
Yes.
369
I mean, I did an emotional chatbot a while ago, helping teens with suicide ideations.
370
And we intervened in about 6,000 suicide ideations.
371
The teens were more comfortable talking to the chatbot because it was totally empathetic simulation, but also non-judgmental.
372
It would ask questions and not judge.
373
So, actually, we got better results with the emotional chatbot than with therapists.
374
Now, of course, in the background, we always had therapists because you need at some point human intervention.
375
And then we realized there are people who are doing a much better job than I was doing.
376
And so I stopped that particular aspect, you know, suicide prevention.
377
But it's on the way.
378
You will see that you will have chatbots diagnosing mental and physical problems better, giving better advice, and always a consortium of physicians or health workers in the back.
379
You can't do without them.
380
But, you know, it will accelerate our ability to diagnose.
381
I know a robotic surgeon who lives in Abu Dhabi.
382
And, you know, he sits in front of a computer and does robotic surgery in Chicago.
383
So all he's doing is moving electrons on his computer.
384
And the robot in Chicago is doing a better job than any cardiac surgeon.
385
So we are in a very interesting time.
386
And, you know, wait a few years, we'll have a cultural, social, biological leapfrogging in our evolution.
387
Yeah, well, actually, that was leading my next question: is you talk about AI fostering a spiritual awakening, and we talked a little bit about that at the beginning: how there is the potential for everybody to explore human, the history of human spiritual thought through chatbots and that.
388
And that, because of all of the contradictions and conflicts over time between different religious traditions, that should be resolved into a cohesive, coherent religious thought or religious theory that everyone can participate in.
389
Can you talk about what you see coming in the future as AI?
390
What do you mean by spiritual awakening?
391
Spiritual awakening is to go beyond all human constructs and know your fundamental identity as what spiritual traditions call the soul or the spirit.
392
But let's just call it consciousness or awareness without any human construct.
393
That's a field of infinite possibilities.
394
That's a field of infinite self-regulation, infinite organization, and self-evolution and self-regulation.
395
It connects everything with everything else.
396
And you could call pure consciousness if you wanted to God, but that's a kind of a very dicey term to use.
397
Because as soon as we say God, we have an image of God.
398
And then it's not God.
399
To define God would be to limit God.
400
Okay, so if the infinite cannot be compromised.
401
Having thought about this, I came up with my own mathematical formula, which is zero is equal to infinite is equal to one.
402
So, you know, the universe is created in a digital workshop outside of space and time that is spinning out zeros and ones in different combinations.
403
Some of them appear as Craig, and some of them appear as this iPhone, and some of them appear as a computer.
404
But this cosmic mind, which is infinite, has the capacity to spin out infinite combinations of zeros and ones.
405
And the difference between you and a mountain and the moon and the stars is just a different combination of zeros and ones in an infinite mind, which is incomprehensible.
406
Now, that's my framework through which I start.
407
And then I say, what did the great spiritual traditions do in order to experience this blissful, all-encompassing, LSD-like psychedelic experience?
408
And then there's meditation, there's awareness of the body, there's introceptive awareness, there's breathing techniques, there is transcendence, there's mantra practice, there's prayer.
409
How can I take all this body of knowledge and actually say, Craig, what do you want to know tonight?
410
You know, you want a meditation for sleep, or you want a meditation for giving a glimpse of who you really are?
411
You say, yeah, I want this.
412
I can create that for you.
413
And then it's up to you to when you take the journey or not.
414
But I can show you the map, and then you can say, oh, Maybe I'll take this journey.
415
Yeah, I have to ask, do you actively meditate?
416
I actively meditate two, three hours a day, and you know, I'm 78 plus, so I don't work that hard, even though I write all these books because that's you know, it's just what I do, but yeah, and I meditate now more than ever on my death as my next chapter and what lies beyond.
417
Yeah, okay.
418
And you regard digital Dharma as a guide, or is it a thought experiment?
419
It's a user's manual.
420
Okay, I'm gonna have to read it, and I apologize for not reading it.
421
Okay, hang up.
422
I'm going to send you three AI-created videos of my conversations with the Buddha.
423
And if you like them, show them on your program.
424
Okay, absolutely, I will.
425
Yeah, and where are you based, Deepak?
426
My body is in New York, and I'm outside of Space Time.
427
Okay, I'd love to meet you someday.
428
I live in Westchester County.
429
Oh, we'll get together for sure.
430
Yeah, building multi-agent software is hard.
431
Agent-to-agent and agent-to-tool communication is still the wild west.
432
How do you achieve accuracy and consistency in non-deterministic agentic apps?
433
That's where agency, AGNTCY, comes in.
434
The agency is an open source collective building the internet of agents.
435
And what's the internet of agents?
436
It's a collaboration layer where AI agents can communicate, discover each other, and work across frameworks.
437
For developers, this means standardized agent discovery tools, seamless protocols for interagent communication, and modular components to compose and scale multi-agent workflows.
438
