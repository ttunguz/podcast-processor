1
Something I speak about frequently on Invest Like the Best is the idea of life's work.
2
A more fun way to think about it is that I'm looking for maniacs on a mission.
3
This is the basis for our investment firm Positive Sum, and it's the reason why I'm so enthusiastic about our presenting sponsor, RAMP.
4
Not only are the founders, Kareem and Eric, life's work-level founders, certainly maniacs on a mission, they have created a product that is effectively an unlock for founders and finance team to do more of their life's work by streamlining financial operations, saving everyone their most precious resource, time.
5
RAMP has built a command and control system for corporate cards and expense management.
6
You can issue cards, manage approvals, make vendor payments of all kinds, and even automate closing your books all in one place.
7
Speaking from my own experience using RAMP for my business, the product is wildly intuitive, simplistic, and makes life so much easier that you'll feel bad for any company who hasn't yet made the switch.
8
The RAMP team is relentless, and the product continues to evolve to save you time that you would never have dreamed of getting back.
9
To me, there is nothing more interesting than technologies that reduce friction for other entrepreneurs to be able to build the thing that they want to.
10
So much attention has gone to cloud computing, APIs, and other ways of making life easy for founders.
11
What RAMP has done and is doing is build yet another set of tools in this category.

Hey everyone, Patrick O'Shaughnessy here.
16
If you've been thinking about the infrastructure behind AI, what's powering it, where capital is flowing, and how to stay ahead of the curve, you'll want to join me for a live webcast I'm hosting with AlphaSense.
17
It's called What's Next for AI and Data Centers, and we're diving into the future of cloud compute, data center investment, and the cybersecurity landscape that's forming around it.
18
I'll be joined by Michelle Brophy from AlphaSense and Gary Michel, formerly of AWS, to break down the most important forces shaping this space.
19
We'll also get into topics like the investment impact of Google's acquisition of Wiz and how tools like DeepSeek are influencing spend.com slash invest to register.
20
Again, that's alpha-sense.com slash invest.
21
Hope to see you there.
22
Ridgeline gets me so excited because every investment professional knows the core challenge that they solve.
23
You love the core work of investing, but operational complexities eat up valuable time and energy.
24
That's where Ridgeline comes in.
25
Ridgeline is an all-in-one operating system designed specifically for investment managers, and their momentum has been incredible, with about $350 billion now committed to the platform and a 60% increase in customers since just October.
26
Firms are flocking to Ridgeline for a good reason.
27
They've been leading the investment management tech industry in AI for over a year with 100% of their users opting into their AI capabilities, putting them light years ahead of other vendors thanks to their single source of data.
28
And they recently released the industry's first AI agents, digital coworkers that can operate independently.
29
Their customers are already using this highly innovative technology and calling it mind-blowing.
30
You don't have to put up with the juggling multiple legacy systems and spending endless quarter ends compiling reports.
31
Ridgeline has created a comprehensive cloud platform that handles everything in real time, from trading and portfolio management to compliance and client reporting.
32
It's worth reaching out to Ridgeline to see what the experience can be like with a single platform.

My guest today is Gustav Soderstrom.
44
Gustav is the co-president, chief product officer, and chief technology officer at Spotify.
45
Gustav lets us behind the scenes on how Spotify thinks about the future of audio and video and what leadership lessons he's learned from making mistakes and taking risks in a rapidly changing technology landscape.
46
He shares fascinating insights on their synchronized team structure and how they've positioned themselves as the RD department for the entire music industry.
47
We discuss their integration of AI, their unique Betsboard process for allocating resources, and how they've evolved from a music service into a multimedia platform with over 650 million users.
48
Please enjoy my great conversation with Gustav Soderstrom.
49
Maybe a fun place to begin is the obvious place.
50
Everyone is facing this giant shift in technology.
51
My friend Ravi Gupta calls this imperative AI or die, that companies, even the big, sexy, established technology companies, need to find ways to embrace and use this new technology as it unfolds or face elimination.
52
I would love to hear how you and Spotify are thinking about this.
53
I know you've embraced it very quickly and you were very early to using machine learning and data science all over the product.
54
But this is a big shift and you and Daniel and the team are some of the most thoughtful people about addressing shifts like this and you've done it before.
55
Walk us through in some detail how you first felt it, what you did about it, what it's like to be at a big company and process something like this.
56
Yeah, it's a great question.
57
I think it's the right description, at least in the longer term, I think it is AI or DAI.
58
Just like it was smartphone or die and before that internet or die, computer or die.
59
This is one of those shifts that it's not your choice whether you adopt it or not.
60
It's going to happen to you.
61
It's the epitome of a macro window.
62
And usually when these macro winds come, we have a saying internally that you can have the macro wind blow in your face.
63
It's not going to change its direction.
64
So you basically need to reposition yourself so you get the wind at your back and can surf this macro wind or some people call it macrowave the usurping.
65
So we've been through a few of these.
66
The first one was really the smartphone when that came along.
67
Spotify was really well positioned for the internet before the smartphone, where we had a free tier on desktop and that's where we acquired users and they built a playlist and they retained themselves.
68
And then mobility to listen on the go was a paid feature on Spotify.
69
And that was fine when the majority was computers and the minority was smartphones.
70
And then when smartphones took off, we faced an existential crisis where there started to be consumers who didn't have a desktop.
71
They only had a phone.
72
So they had no free experience and our entire model died.
73
So that was one of those moments.
74
We had to reposition the entire business model actually and figure out how do we do a free tier on mobile that doesn't cannibalize the paid feature, which was one of those examples.
75
And I think this is a similar one.
76
The big question to me is does this require a business model change or is it quote unquote just a product change?
77
The other thing that is different I think about AI is that it's not going to touch one thing.
78
It touches the consumer product but it also touches your productivity and competitiveness as a company.
79
So there are lots of different angles to start.
80
But as you said, we were quite early with machine learning.
81
The journey we had was we saw users coming on Spotify and then they started playlisting and that retained themselves.
82
But it was only a certain amount of people who were good at playlisting because you have to know the catalog in your head, the new releases, the back catalog.
83
So some people retain themselves really well.
84
And then we tried to scale that behavior by having editors who created playlists for people who couldn't playlist that well.
85
And we saw people using social to find inspiration.
86
Eventually, machine learning started happening.
87
We saw this opportunity of building a music friend for everyone.
88
So that's where we started.
89
And we started investing in that and got quite good at that.
90
I think some people say that AI is just machine learning, it's just a new word.
91
And it's an interesting question.
92
What is the difference?
93
I think the difference between what people used to call machine learning and what we call generative AI is that the statistical machine learning was an output mechanism.
94
And I think the epitome of that age is the full screen TikTok feed.
95
UIs shape themselves after technology that powers them to maximize metrics.
96
And I think that is the UI that maximizes the statistical explore-exploit paradigm of old school machine learning.
97
What happens with generative AI, I think the big shift is that you can take natural language inputs.
98
And the big shift is that it's two-way.
99
If you think about Spotify, for example, this consumer product, the way it looks, it's almost like an old-school broadband.
100
The broadband where you have maybe one megabit downlink, but only 150-kilobit uplink.
101
So, a lot of bandwidth down, but not a lot of feedback.
102
This is what most consumer services look like.
103
You have streaming video on the downlink, a lot of information per second, but the uplink is only a few clicks and swipes.
104
It's very, very narrow signal.
105
And this is what the previous machine learning age focused on.
106
I think what changes in the age of generative AI is that the uplink can now be English language.
107
It can be almost as rich as the downlink.
108
And I think that requires all of us consumer companies to, in the limit, totally rethink the product.
109
So, if you just do the deduction of what I said, if the full-screen TikTok feed is the epitome of the ML paradigm, the asymmetric downlink-uplink paradigm, what are the chances that that is also the epitome of this generative AI age?
110
I don't think so.
111
I think consumer products are going to change fundamentally.
112
I can't predict exactly how.
113
I think they're going to be much more symmetric in terms of information you receive versus information you give.
114
And I think if you fast forward five to ten years, almost all big consumer products are going to be a conversation to some extent rather than this service that you use.
115
So, really, the job for us on the product side is to try to figure out what is the next paradigm.
116
And I don't know exactly what it is yet.
117
We're experimenting.
118
And if I did know, I probably wouldn't tell you right now and sit on it for a bit.
119
But this is where on the product side.
120
And then we can talk a bit about the productivity side as well, where there are the obvious gains in terms of.
121
But as a big company, there are a few differences from the startups.
122
Because so far, generative AI encoding has had the most impact when you write net new code, which is a lot of what you do as a startup and a tiny bit of what you do as a big company.
123
Most of it is just refactoring, et cetera.
124
And I think I saw some statistics that in a big company, you basically code one out of every eight hours in a day.
125
So not only is coding only one-eighth of the time, of that one-eighth of the time, net new code is very small.
126
So I actually think the biggest impact is yet to come when it comes to coding.
127
That's two things.
128
These models are getting big enough to understand really large and complex code bases like Spotify's.
129
And we're not quite there where these things can refactor our code base.
130
It doesn't have quite that deep understanding, but it will.
131
And that will be a big shift.
132
The other is doing automatic peer review.
133
We're just on the verge of that working.
134
It's not quite good enough that you can trust it.
135
So a lot of developers sit and wait for the code to be in review and come back.
136
So I think we're seeing that ramp.
137
I think we're going to see it ramp a lot in the next few years.
138
But then the really interesting side is these other seven hours, what a developer does, which is a lot of communication, planning, working with designers, prototyping, meetings.
139
Those things I think will actually have as big or even more impact than the coding itself.
140
I'm going to start with this downlink, uplink part.
141
What have you learned about consumers' willingness to put a lot of effort into the uplink?
142
It seems like the chat interfaces, the GPTs of the world, we know that people are willing to do a lot of back and forth because it's the native interface.
143
In an app like Spotify, how willing are people to get not lazy and really descriptive about what they actually want?
144
What have you learned about the nature of people's laziness versus willing to put a lot of work in to get the thing that they want via that more rich uplink?
145
Yeah, so that's probably the most exciting thing for us of this generative AI age and the dual uplink paradigm.
146
So previously, we mostly relied on some explicit input when you playlist.
147
That's high-value information.
148
You are sitting there thinking this song goes really well with this song and that song.
149
So if you think about it as labeling, even though you're playlisting for yourself, you're sort of labeling these tracks, at least in relation to each other, and you're putting a lot of effort in it.
150
And that was and is our big advantage in music recommendations, even though generative recommendation systems are starting to take over from these more old school collaborative systems.
151
So we had some really strong signal like that, where you quite seldomly invested a lot of time in producing a data set that described you about playlisting.
152
But most of the time, we just had skips.
153
And the challenge for us is the phone is in the pocket.
154
So even if we had the thumbs up down, you're not going to take out the phone every time and say, I didn't like this because of that.
155
Or even do a thumbs up, thumbs down.
156
It requires you to take up your phone, unlock it, open Spotify.
157
What you can do from your earphone is to skip.
158
So we have the skip signal, but that is a very blunt signal.
159
So we play your song and you skip it.
160
That could be because you absolutely hated it.
161
It could be because you love it, but it's 100 times.
162
You're tired of it.
163
It could be that you love it.
164
You're not tired of it, but you're at the gym.
165
So jazz is not the right thing.
166
All of those just look like a skip to us.
167
We have a lot of that signal, but it's blunt.
168
And you will never get to a perfect personalization.
169
Now, what we find with generative AI, one of the first services that we've launched that is live now in 40 countries, is something called AI playlisting.
170
We literally use an LLM that is trained on your listening data and world knowledge and so forth.
171
And you can literally tell us in English what kind of playlist you want.
172
Previously, you could playlist songs and maybe put a title on it and we could guess.
173
This is probably a running playlist.
174
So we could do something.
175
Now you can say, I want a running playlist that is EDM.
176
I want big drops.
177
I want it to be 160 BPM.
178
And then you get a suggestion from the LLM and then you can keep a few tracks and say, these were good, these were not good.
179
Now refine it.
180
I don't like these artists, but I want more of that.
181
So for us, it's the first time that we get that kind of fidelity of what is actually in the user's mind.
182
One way to think about Spotify is we always try to reproduce a small part of your neural cortex on our servers.
183
It was just very hard with a click stream of skips.
184
Now when you tell us what is in your mind, it gets easier to approximate you as a person.
185
So this is really the first time that we have that signal.
186
One way I like to think about it is when we do user research, we do two things.
187
We do quantitative testing, A-B test, but before that, we do qualitative testing.
188
We interview a few people deeply to understand the need.
189
Then we build a product and then we A-B test to see if we're right.
190
The promise of generative AI is really a deep, ongoing qualitative user research with almost 700 million users all the time.
191
It sounds big, but if you squint at it, that's kind of what it is.
192
It's interesting how many different ways you could take the product with this new technology.
193
I would be really curious to know the apparatus inside of Spotify, the leadership team, the product team, and literally how you run the process of deciding what to do with your big team, obviously, but no matter what, you have limited effort, limited units of effort.
194
So, there's a huge space of stuff you could do with this technology and the exciting advantage that you have of the 700 million users.
195
What is the literal meeting by meetings process, the setup process look like?
196
And the reason I'm asking this question is so many companies face this same challenge.
197
It's exciting, but also scary that they need to get the innovation before somebody else does and disrupts them.
198
So, what is the background process for how you arrive at the things you might try?
199
There are really two things.
200
We have a very structured process that I want to talk through how it works, but there are also some concepts that we use.
201
And over the years, I've introduced some strategic frameworks to the company, which I know you're passionate about, like Seven Powers, Half-N-Hammer, Bundling Framework, Shishimoshira.
202
He's on the board, right?
203
He's on the board.
204
Secret weapon.
205
Exactly.
206
Very good secret weapon.
207
And also, I found Better, Simpler Strategy by Felix Oberhausen-Geet to be very good.
208
What's that one?
209
I don't know.
210
It's a concept of the value stick where you have willingness to pay, which is very important for us.
211
The way we measure values, the willingness to pay.
212
But what it introduces is also the willingness to sell.
213
If you think about your staff, what is their willingness to sell their services to you?
214
And everyone focuses on increasing the willingness to pay, but you can also increase, or depending on how you think about, decrease the willingness to sell.
215
And it turns out the best companies in the world are not necessarily the ones who actually pay the most, it's the ones with the most interesting mission, the best culture, et cetera.
216
So, because we're a bundled service where we try to just give users more and more value all the time, we put in lots of music, that's value.
217
Then we put in more podcasts, that's value.
218
Now we put in books, it's more value.
219
This framework of willingness to pay and willingness to sell fits our business really well.
220
And the job of us is to keep the willingness to pay.
221
And our goal as a service is to make sure that this Spotify is just an amazing deal.
222
You're always going to feel the willingness to pay, the actual value you perceive, is way over the price that we have.
223
So we use that framework quite a lot.
224
So introducing these frameworks, not just in the business world, but also in the product and technology world, makes people think in more structured ways.
225
It makes people have a vocabulary.
226
We can talk about network effects, amortization, brand power, all of these things.
227
So I spend a lot of time getting the teams to use these frameworks so that we have structured strategic thinking.
228
And the other thing I'll try to push as a thesis is that I'm a big fan of Socratic debate.
229
I'm amazed, like many other people, how far the Greeks and the Romans came with just discussion, even though they didn't have science, just reasoning.
230
Strong reasoning is very useful.
231
So I'll try to push this provocative line of talk is cheap, so we should do a lot of it.
232
That's a counter to like moving fast and breaking things.
233
It's so cheap to talk, so we should actually do a bit more of it.
234
It took the Greeks to the concept of the atom.
235
So we do a lot of talking and ideation that is quite structured.
236
And I do that with my leadership team and often the leadership team sort of plus one, which means the VP layer and sort of the director plus.
237
I don't have a lot of time just for discussing concepts.
238
Back to one of my heroes in life, David Deutsch.
239
His book, The Beginning of Infinity and the Fabric of Reality, shaped me quite a lot.
240
And he talks about something called good explanations.
241
And he has a list of what a good explanation is.
242
It obviously needs to be falsifiable and so forth, but it also needs to have reach.
243
It needs to scale.
244
An okay explanation explains this phenomenon, but it's the solar system to the planets but it's also very hard to vary which i think is often underestimated if you have an explanation and you can switch it out for another explanation that explains the same thing.
245
If you explain the weather using gods, you can switch out this god for that god.
246
It's probably not a good explanation.
247
It needs to be very hard to vary.
248
If you vary it, it doesn't explain it anymore.
249
The last thing he says is that explanations should not just be predicted.
250
That's not an explanation, that's a model.
251
An explanation needs to explain why.
252
So I try to push my teams.
253
Even if something works in an A-B test, I tend to say like, I don't want to launch it until you have a good theory of why it works.
254
Because if you figure out the why, it's the difference between pattern recognition and actually understanding something.
255
Pattern recognition is useful.
256
That's called seniority.
257
A lot of people good pattern recognition, but if they can explain why it works, it scales to the entire org.
258
Other people can use that knowledge.
259
It's much, much more valuable.
260
So those are some of the concepts that I've tried to put into the org over time.
261
So I think that's important because that shapes the culture.
262
Then we have the structured process, which is we execute for six months at a time.
263
We have something called a bets process where all the VPs, which is about 14, so one of the benefits of Spotify is they're so small that all the VPs, the entire company, can fit in one room.
264
And we meet three hours every Tuesday.
265
So the company is completely synchronized, for good and bad.
266
And we can talk about that later.
267
But so every six months, these VPs, they pitch, literally pitch, as if we were a VC and they were a startup.
268
The bets that they think the company should do and why.
269
It's very much like a startup process.
270
You don't get to use the fact that Gustav or Alex or Daniel may like you.
271
Then me and the other co-president, Alex Nordstrom, we decide based on these pitches a global stack rank.
272
This time we have 44 bets.
273
That's usually between 30 and maybe 50.
274
We stack rank them from one to 44.
275
Then we go out to the organs.
276
They now try to resource this.
277
And they start from the top and then maybe they get to 30 and say this is what we can do in the next six months.
278
And then they commit to those things and we start executing.
279
And it's a good mix of bottoms-up innovation where you leverage not just Daniel, not just me and Alex, but all the VPs and the layers below to come up with good ideas because they're closest to the user.
280
But then there is global synchronization.
281
We stack rank them, make sure that they fit a single strategy, and it's back to the organ.
282
They commit.
283
As I think, you know, you're going to be much better at delivering something if you were the one who said, I can do this.
284
Then if your boss said, you can do this.
285
So that's the process.
286
But leading up to that, we have something called a prototyping phase.
287
So the previous six months, we prototype in the combination of Figma and increasingly Gen AI tools, what Spotify should look like after the next six months or could look like.
288
And this prototype also helps synchronize the entire company.
289
What I found previously was that when people submitted these bets, everyone had in their mind what their great feature would be.
290
You start building and then down the line you realize that you are not actually aligned.
291
And then you get a lot of fighting towards the end of the cycle where this thing doesn't work with that thing and things don't work out so well.
292
What I've tried to do now, together with Alex Nordstrom, we synchronize the entire company.
293
Alex and I don't have our direct reports team.
294
We meet as a single team three hours every Tuesday and we try to use the fact that we're small as an advantage instead of as a disadvantage versus our competitors.
295
So all the so-called quote-unquote fighting happens before you actually commit to doing something and you have something you can hold in your hand.
296
Say, this is what Spotify would look like if we pull this off.
297
So that's a combination of cultural input and then a very structured process for actually making it work.
298
I have so many questions about process.
299
The first is how that three-hour meeting on Tuesday works.
300
What is the structure of that meeting?
301
It's called the E-Team, execution team.
302
So it's very focused on execution of the company.
303
And the idea is that if you have five-day working weeks, there's never on average more than two and a half days before you, if you're blocked on something, can escalate to me, Alex, and all the other VPs.
304
So the idea is you should never be blocked more than max two and a half days.
305
Because we run this synchronized ship, if you're blocked, it gets very expensive because everyone else is downstream of you.
306
So if you're running a synchronized operation the way we're doing, escalation processes are very important and resolution is very important.
307
So a big part of that meeting is people say, we're off track here.
308
I'm dependent on this man or woman over there who hasn't done what they said.
309
And the beautiful thing about being able to have all the VPs in the same room is so many meetings that I'm sure you've been in, people said, okay, we'll take that offline.
310
I'll talk later.
311
And what we said is you're not allowed to say the word offline or later because that person is in the room.
312
I'm dependent on maybe Anna over there for this.
313
But then Anna is actually there.
314
And then Anna can say, okay, I didn't know that or I'm going to solve that.
315
So it's real-time resolution.
316
Very simple in theory, but incredibly powerful in practice.
317
Most companies don't do it.
318
So this notion of no, taking it offline, taking it later, real-time resolution.
319
That's why it's three hours.
320
So that's one thing of this meeting.
321
Another principle we have in that meeting, except nothing goes offline, is you actually can't bring your direct reports for good and bad.
322
The idea is that if you bring in a lot of direct reports, two things are going to happen.
323
One is the VP is not going to get forced to know the details as much.
324
So, I'm trying to literally force the VPs to solve it themselves, because I want them to be in the details.
325
So, you're not allowed to bring anyone else in to explain your thing.
326
You have to be on top of it enough to explain it yourself.
327
The other benefit of that is, over time, these groups get very tight because you don't switch people out all the time.
328
So, you build strong rapport, people can be honest, no one is afraid.
329
It's a very strong and high-functioning team.
330
So, that's a lot of what we do.
331
The other part is strategy and looking forward.
332
So, let's say that something we've been working on for some time now that is public, we wanted to introduce music videos, and the team goes off and says, what does that take in terms of licensing product?
333
What is the cost implications for the company, for the PL?
334
They come and present to the team.
335
This is what we want to do.
336
This is how long we think it should take.
337
So, it's a combination of keeping the engine running and never stopping, and also planning for the future.
338
But we don't really plan in that.
339
It's too big to have detailed planning.
340
That happens in focus rooms with smaller groups, with experts.
341
And then they come and present to that team.
342
We're not the only company that does this.
343
I know Airbnb does something similar.
344
I spoke a lot to Bronceski about it.
345
I think Netflix may have had something similar at a time, but they're now divided into content, the business, and product.
346
What I think is important about this is it's both the business and the product side.
347
And we talk a lot of product there.
348
So, the business people in Spotify, they know an awful lot about A High, about what a monorepo is.
349
They're there for the privatization of technology.
350
But on the flip side, they know exactly what the P<unk>L looks like.
351
They know our goals.
352
They know what gross margin is.
353
They know everything.
354
So that's quite unique.
355
And that gives them the CEO perspective.
356
that I think disappears in many companies because we put on these roles of you're a product person, so you're not supposed to understand finance.
357
That's not true.
358
If you're the CEO, you have to understand all of it.
359
If people are listening and are curious about this bets board process where you can submit projects and it seems like a really elegant way to allocate capital, what advice would you give them about the pros and cons of this process?
360
And I know you've been doing it a long time, how it's changed over time to reflect the learnings of what makes it work or fail?
361
So the concept itself is actually really straightforward.
362
It comes from the Kandan board.
363
It comes from the developer community, which actually comes from car manufacturing eventually.
364
It's just like, it's really the concept of stack ranking, which is very easy in theory and very hard in practice.
365
Very few people manage to say, this is actually more important than that.
366
They're just saying these things are very important, both of them.
367
And when you press them, they say, no, they're equally important.
368
But then they're not ranked.
369
So the real secret is to stack rank.
370
And say, you have your two darlings, but if you have to kill one of them, which do you kill first in reverse order?
371
So very easy, but hard to do across the entire company to agree on that.
372
But once you have it, it gives so much clarity to the org.
373
Because what happens when you say these three things are equally important, but they're not really.
374
They never are.
375
You're going to have to choose.
376
Is you just push the decision down the org.
377
And this VPU is on the hook for that thing.
378
It's going to start fighting.
379
This VPU is on the hook for the other thing.
380
And if you as a leader don't bring clarity, you're going to set your org up for fighting.
381
And people are very nice.
382
They're going to think that they don't like each other.
383
So just the stack ranking and being completely transparent across the entire company means that if I come to you, we should do this.
384
It's very simple but very effective.
385
And when you do that, there are a bunch of things you run into.
386
Theoretical questions of, okay, once you have this that board done, do you resource it globally?
387
Do you go through every developer and say, Oh, let's just try to get as far as we can?
388
That planning process is hell if everyone is up for grabs.
389
None of my VPs have any estimate of what resources they will have.
390
You basically disempower your entire VPs.
391
It's effective in a sense because you do perfect resourcing, but it's incredibly inefficient to do the planning.
392
So, then the question is: how do you divide it into blocks?
393
The structure we have is: we have a platform organization, they work with GCP and the cloud and the developer tools and so forth, and security, and all of that.
394
Then, we have an experience organization who's responsible for the entire consumer product across mobile, car, desktop, et cetera.
395
Then, a personalization organization, because that's so important to us, that does all the AI and the recommendations and balances between books, music, podcasts, video, etc.
396
And then we have three business verticals: music, podcast, and books.
397
So, they have their own resources.
398
And what we do is we start by asking them to resource as far as they can with the resources they have without stealing from each other.
399
And then we get as far as we can because you need to give them predictability for them to be able to plan their own work.
400
And then, at the end of that process, you may move some people around globally to make sure that you don't have something really important and there are two people missing.
401
That's not optimal for the companies.
402
You may move some people around, but largely, we try to let people keep the resourcing.
403
So, lots of those problems that you run into.
404
But I would say the biggest risk with this model, it sounds nice if you're perfectly synchronized.
405
And we've had to build our own tooling.
406
We tried some external tooling for planning that wasn't good enough.
407
And if the planning doesn't work, the overhead just grows very quickly versus execution.
408
We execute for six months in order for the overhead to not get too big, but we can't go to a year, then you can't react.
409
A quarter is too short, it's too much planning overhead versus execution.
410
So, the planning is the thing that you have to get really good at.
411
And I'm not going to say we're really good, but we're getting better all the time.
412
It's the thing that I care the most about, making sure that the planning is reasonably big.
413
If you can do it, for us, it's critical because the whole of Spotify's product strategy is that we have large distribution closing in on 700 million MEUs for a single application.
414
And our entire strategy is basically, we decided this many years ago before it was popular, but you saw the Chinese starting to build super apps, whereas the Western world built one app per use case.
415
We adopted the Chinese super app idea and said the hardest thing is going to be to get installs.
416
You could see the average number of installs from the app store dropping below one on average.
417
So, distribution became the most important thing.
418
And then we chose when we did podcasts and later books and videos, we're going to build it in the same application because then we can leverage our own distribution.
419
But that has drawbacks.
420
You have to have an organization because then everything is dependent on each other.
421
You're going to ship one app to the app store, and everyone is a stakeholder.
422
So, you cannot divide and conquer.
423
You cannot say, well, the book team, you can run ahead, or the music team, you do this.
424
No, everyone has to wait for everyone.
425
So, because of our consumer strategy, the company needed to be synchronized, and because it needed to be synchronized, we needed a really strong planning process.
426
We're good at doing global changes, like changing the entire UI because we're synchronized.
427
But we're probably much slower than other companies at trying something because it needs to go through a lot of planning.
428
I don't think you can win in planning.
429
The best you can hope for is to be quite good at the important things and not so good at the less important things.
430
I want to come back to something very interesting you said around the adoption of some of the tooling that's at the most cutting edge.
431
So, let's take Cursor as an example of a company that now everyone's familiar with, $10 billion valuation.
432
Seems like every software engineer is using Cursor to make themselves better.
433
But the way you framed it was so cool that, yeah, sure, but that's new code primarily.
434
That's a fraction of one-eighth of their time.
435
In the pie chart, it's a very small sliver that's being addressed by Cursor at big companies.
436
Can you describe how you think this will play out?
437
Because it feels like the public markets, especially, I guess, private markets too, are very curious about how AI companies and products and tools will address this much bigger part of the pie that sounds like really hasn't been hit too directly yet.
438
There are a couple of things that are interesting that I don't think are super obvious.
439
One is it used to be that every developer started using cursor, but now I'm starting to see a lot more non-developers using cursor.
440
That's partially because the industry is starting to agree on this protocol called MCP, Modern Context Protocol, which means that if you take your internal services and you wrap them in an MCP, you can speak English to your infrastructure.
441
So, if you're a developer now, or if you're a designer, for example, or a product person, let's say you want to prototype a feature in Spotify, one workflow is you take the existing Spotify.
442
And then, if your services are wrapped in MCP, you could theoretically say, now wire this up to my like songs feed or something.
443
And you can prototype, even though you're not a developer, because the infrastructure is wrapped in English language now through MCP.
444
I think that's an important thing.
445
So, I think you're going to see many more people using cursor than just developers.
446
I'm starting to see, I had one of my PMs who is in Sweden, she's from New Zealand, doesn't speak Swedish, she did her taxes in Cursor, managed to wrap the Swedish tax authority in MCP.
447
Not a developer.
448
So, I think it's going to grow outside of developers, but I think this points to what is actually happening in many of these big companies, which is why the startups can move faster.
449
So, if you think of a company like Spotify, it has tons of infrastructure.
450
You have the database with play history going 15 years back, you have who was in the family plan, that's one server, this is one data set somewhere, your taste graph is the data set, and so forth.
451
Now, here comes the big AI companies, and they give you this reasoning engine.
452
Some of them are open source.
453
So, basically, for free, you get what is getting close to Age I.
454
So, now you have this thing that you thought would be incredibly expensive, and you get it almost for free.
455
It's a gift.
456
You start using it.
457
What is the first problem you run into?
458
You say, How has my music listening changed over the last year?
459
That's not exposed as an API because, in the previous machine learning world, that data, the listening data 15 years back, it's on cold storage somewhere.
460
And an engineer would have had to do an SQL job that may have taken a week to pull it up.
461
Then you would have trained a model, then you put it back in cold storage.
462
Now, you want to be able to reason over that in real time.
463
You need to expose all your data as APIs in real time.
464
So, actually, my biggest job to enable AI is not AI engineering, it's old school engineering, exposing all this data that we have so that you can have a reasoning engine reason for you as a product person or actually for me as a consumer potentially over my own data in real time.
465
So, I think that's what's happening.
466
So, the combination of now there's a standard MCPs that you can wrap these APIs in, and many of these companies, at least us trying to expose all of this data, means that a business person, a lawyer, a product person, a designer will be able to use cursor without having to code.
467
And they can actually at least prototype or talk to real services.
468
That, I think, is the journey that we're on.
469
It started with developers, but I think as you expose the infrastructure and wrap it in APIs, I think it's going to have to go outside.
470
There's a way to say that and lose a lot, but summarize it: that what we've seen happen with developers is going to happen.
471
I'm surprised that it's cursor that they're using, that's quite interesting, but with other similar tools.
472
And that just more of our work is going to feel like we're working with a team, speaking to a team, using natural language to prototype things, to try things.
473
And that will diffuse slowly through the entire, not only just the hours of the software developer, but the hours of each of the other functional areas.
474
Yeah, I think so.
475
It's hard to see where it's going to land because you're somewhere right now, but we're pretty certain that that somewhere is on this curve.
476
So, you can be pretty certain that the workflows you see right now are not going to be the same.
477
That's actually one of the problems.
478
How much are we going to build for what we see right now when you know the models are going to be more capable, they're going to be different tooling very soon?
479
So, you don't want to overfit too much to the moment.
480
A reasonable view of a modern company is that all of its data is exposed in real time, and you have some tool on top, like Kercher or something else, maybe different tools for different skills, maybe a tool more.
481
The licensing team at Spotify may have a different tool to reason over all the contracts and quickly say, Do we think we can do this in that market?
482
And what do we need to license to do this?
483
But also, the product team could ask that licensing engine.
484
We have 15 years of contracts, both current and previous, so this AI has a lot of insight into what music licensing looks like more than any single person in Spotify, if you train it that way.
485
There will probably be slightly custom interfaces for different skills.
486
I'm not sure which is going to win out, but I think it's going to look something like that.
487
Right now, what we see people doing is they're sharing examples of prompts they used for the workflows and then prototypes that they've used.
488
And that feels like very much a point in time.
489
It's kind of hacky and different things.
490
If you were to calibrate the world out there, so few people have the inside view that you do, where you're excited by this technology, you're trying to embrace it, you're only able to embrace it so fast in the ways that we've described, on a one to ten-point scale or something like this.
491
What score would you give how much this is impacting you so far and how crazy this might get?
492
People are very excited that this is going to literally change everything.
493
And there are some people that are actually worried about how much, how powerful it might be.
494
From a practical real-world standpoint, could you calibrate us a little bit as one of the few people that actually is both excited about it and also faces reality on a daily basis?
495
If you want to be as realistic as possible about it, you take the developer use case.
496
I've seen studies from other big companies that if you actually measure out of the developer's time, the speed up is 7% or something, which sounds very disappointing because of all these things.
497
So I think right now it's a bit overhyped in terms of actual impact, at least for these big companies.
498
But I think it's going to turn it into the opposite.
499
And I think right now, people are overexcited versus the actual impact.
500
But I think the opposite is going to happen.
501
I think it's going to have tremendous impact over the longer term.
502
What I see people doing right now, it depends.
503
I mean, I use it a lot personally.
504
I see a lot of my developers and product people and designers use it all the time for just productivity purposes.
505
Putting things into an engine, asking it for the summary and so forth.
506
Those things happen all the time.
507
It's hard for me to estimate how much that speeds them up already.
508
It certainly does.
509
But I think the really big impact comes as you reshape these companies from this technology.
510
Right now, we're just tacking it on top.
511
But as I said, you have to reshape it and rebuild it for this world, where a reasoning engine can reason in real time over the entire company's data.
512
That requires actually a lot of retooling.
513
That's why startups are ahead.
514
They don't have to rebuild.
515
They don't have 15 years of data.
516
So they're probably in the future, which is why they feel like, no, no, Gusta is wrong.
517
The impact is really big already.
518
And I think it is for a startup.
519
I think it takes a bit longer for big companies.
520
And big companies like us, we have to shape up and accelerate in order to not be behind.
521
I'm sure they would all like to have 700 million monthly active users to experiment with, though.
522
On that topic, you mentioned going through mobile and the experience of not only was everything was changing as a result of mobile, but actually the business model also needed to change.
523
We've really talked about product so far, and there's more to ask about product.
524
But talk about business model.
525
What would be the world in which, as a result of this technology, Spotify's whole business model?
526
We've seen a few of those examples of business models, and I tend to tell my product teams, and everyone says that the world is disrupted and changed by technology.
527
And I think that's true in the sense that the underlying force is technology itself.
528
And it's this gift that keeps on giving.
529
It gives you computers, internet, smartphones, ML, AI, quantum computing.
530
And these gifts keep coming almost on a schedule and they actually come closer and closer.
531
Previously, technology companies were not called technology companies.
532
As a side note, they were called car companies, but it was a technology companies or pharmaceutical companies.
533
That was the state-of-the-art technology right then.
534
But because these macrowaves came so far apart, they called themselves a car company.
535
They never became ubiquitous technology companies.
536
They overfitted to that.
537
I think somewhere in the 90s around Google, Amazon, et cetera, these macrowaves started coming so fast that people tried to pin them down.
538
Amazon is that books company and they were like, nah, not really.
539
We're doing books, but here's other stuff we're selling.
540
And then, okay, you're the everything store company.
541
It's like, nah, not really.
542
Now we're selling Amazon web services over here.
543
So I think these companies are the first set of companies to have technology as the strategy.
544
The previous ones took one wave as the strategy.
545
And then IBM comes along and does computers as a strategy or first memory and so forth.
546
I think this is the first wave of general technology companies, which interestingly might mean that they could be, I mean, companies almost always die after a while.
547
These could be the first companies that never die because they're ubiquitous technology companies.
548
Whatever the technology gift is, just try to have a company that can quickly wrap around it, figure out the product and business model.
549
So I think that's interesting.
550
And that's how I think about Spotify.
551
Yes, we're a user company and then a podcast company and then a book company and a video company.
552
But it's really about trying to anticipate technology.
553
So I said mobile was one of these things where we need to change the business model.
554
And I think what happens when one of these technology gifts comes along is there is a big change when the technology happens.
555
Piracy, big havoc.
556
But the real change happens when someone also figures out the business model.
557
So I tell my product teams: technology can do good things, and then your business model can really change the world.
558
But without a business model, there's seldom like large-scale change.
559
You can destroy a lot of things, but you never really create value.
560
So mobile was the first where we need to figure out a free tier on mobile without cannibalizing our pay tier.
561
And what we did there was we looked at our data and saw that 50% of premium users were listening in shuffle mode.
562
So we said, what if we take shuffle as a feature, give that away for free?
563
It should be 50% of premium consumption, so very valuable, but it's not going to be 100% of anyone's premium consumption, so no cannibalization.
564
And we managed to create a tier where you could playlist all your favorite songs in a playlist, press play, put the phone in your pocket, and listen forever for free in the background.
565
So that was a business model innovation along with technology.
566
The most previous one was audiobooks, where there were audiobooks in the US, a la carte.
567
And sure, we did some nice innovation around being able to stream that book, but the real thing is not to stream a book.
568
You've been able to stream audio for a long time.
569
The real innovation there was the business model, to be able to bundle audiobooks into Spotify Premium.
570
It's almost like music.
571
Music was also a la carte and quite niche.
572
And once we made it an access model with no marginal cost, it got way larger.
573
And that's what we think about audiobooks as well.
574
So we've seen a few of those and managed to adopt them.
575
To your question, is AI going to do that?
576
Do we need to change the business model?
577
I'm not sure.
578
I think there is one glaring thing that is different, which is the previous VC model coming all the way back from chips and silicon was you make a big upfront investment and then you amortize and you get to almost zero marginal cost.
579
That's how software worked.
580
It's not how AI worked.
581
The marginal cost is high and you need to cover it.
582
So you could say that that should change everyone's business model.
583
You're going to need to somehow either monetize very effectively through ads or charge users.
584
And you see OpenAI being a subscription product.
585
And I think you're going to see more of those.
586
So the marginal cost is a net new thing.
587
For Spotify, it's interesting because we're like the one technology company that always had a marginal cost.
588
One more stream was a marginal cost to labels.
589
So we grew up in a world where if we were too successful on the free tear, we could go bankrupt overnight, which was never true for Twitter or Facebook, which is why VC said, just go crazy, worry about monetization later.
590
Spotify could never do that because we could go bankrupt overnight.
591
So we always had to worry about monetization and the balance between free tear and pay tear conversion and free tear monetization.
592
So the good thing for us is we're fairly used to marginal cost in our business model.
593
I think you're going to see those things.
594
It's very likely that some consumers are going to want tons and tons of inference.
595
And because that's a marginal cost, you're probably going to have to pay somehow for that as a consumer.
596
So I think you're going to see more tiering of consumer products based on how much inference you want.
597
But for us, that's not that new.
598
We've had several tiers already.
599
I'm curious because I'm an investor in a company called Etch that's going to be one of these companies that pushes down that inference cost.
600
Like the history of compute, you're going to see this incredible consumer surplus and consumer benefit that comes from cheaper and cheaper unit-by-unit inference cost.
601
But the countervailing force is that we would just use more of it.
602
So it makes me wonder how much more you can imagine better models being useful to you.
603
It seems like if we just froze reasoning and model capabilities today, we probably still have a decade plus of digestion to do of how we could use these models to make better products, better features, whatever.
604
Can you imagine another couple orders of magnitude better models opening up lots of features that you can't currently do?
605
Is that a thing?
606
Or do you think we have what we need?
607
And therefore inference we could expect to be really cheap.
608
So I both subscribe to the product overhang idea that there's a huge product overhang.
609
And if we froze, I think we would see products shipped that look amazing for several years before we exhausted what we have.
610
So I subscribe to that.
611
But I also subscribe to that there is no limit for compute.
612
Eventually you get to computronium.
613
But if you look at just the physics of computronium, what's computronium?
614
It's the most computational universe could do, theoretically.
615
We're very far from that limit.
616
So I think we're going to go all the way there before we stop.
617
And I think we're going to be very inventive.
618
There is a nice analogy.
619
I don't know who came up with it, but I think Ben Evans talks about it quite often.
620
You know, when the spreadsheet came along, the idea was the same.
621
Now all accountants are going to go out of business.
622
What happened was we could just not imagine if calculation cost went to zero.
623
What's going to happen is you could imagine that the value of doing that is going to go to zero because there were so many accountants in the world.
624
So what happened was we just started doing massively more accounting.
625
When there's no cost to spreadsheeting, you're going to start to do models to predict the futures of this asset or good or something into the future forever.
626
We just came up with so much more spreadsheeting.
627
I think from a financial point of view, when the cost of something drops, the demand usually increases more than the drop.
628
And I think that's bound to happen with intelligence.
629
It is the ultimate thing.
630
And to say, like, now I have enough intelligence, it's not interesting.
631
I think we're going to be ashamed of how mundane things we spend inference on.
632
Could my coffee be one degree warmer tomorrow?
633
If it's truly no cost asking the questions, I think people will.
634
Maybe now's the time to ask you about sitting in the back garden with David Deutsch and talking to him about this concept of the beginning of infinity.
635
Computronium made me think of your interest in this topic and your answer there that there's no end point here.
636
It's just going to keep going.
637
We're going to keep learning, keep deploying our new technology.
638
Can you talk about that book, why it influenced you, your conversation with him?
639
Yeah, so David Deutsch has been a hero of mine since I read The Beginning of Infinity, and then he wrote another book called The Fabric of Reality.
640
He's considered the father of quantum computing.
641
Obviously, quantum computing is one of these gifts that technology is going to give us, and it's about to get very real, I think, very soon.
642
So I've always been interested because quantum mechanics is the most insane thing on this planet.
643
We live in what we considered as reality, but if you go to the bottom layer, this is not reality.
644
It's just some three-dimensional projection that we live in.
645
The fabric of reality had a big impact on me.
646
He's an Everettian.
647
He believes in multiple words scenario.
648
I read that book and it blew my mind.
649
Then, The Beginning of Infinity is maybe his most famous book, whereas Fabric of Reality is really about quantum computing and how quantum computer works.
650
Beginning of Infinity is very philosophical, and he has a bunch of big ideas there.
651
He's a very positive person.
652
And now at seven, distanced.
653
And everyone is very negative on the future.
654
There's so many problems.
655
The air could go wrong and all things could go wrong.
656
Climate.
657
He's actually very positive about the future.
658
He's clear that there are risks, but he sees us going out there into the stars.
659
I asked him, where do you think we are in a million years?
660
And he's like, well, maybe we're this far outside of the solar system, but not quite there.
661
He's very certain we're going to get there.
662
He's a very positive person.
663
And when I asked him about his life, he's very content with his life.
664
He's very happy.
665
So he's just an inspiring person still at this age.
666
I wish I will be like him in that age.
667
But this book has a few concepts that I've tried to apply at Spotify.
668
And one of them is he talks about the power of explanations.
669
And he thinks the human mind is infinitely scalable.
670
He does not think there's a limit to what we can understand because of explanations.
671
And I think this is something that a lot of people, I agree with that, but a lot of people disagree.
672
Certainly, there are things we could never understand.
673
His view is: no, there is no limit to what we can understand.
674
We are the only species who broke that barrier because we have explanations.
675
Other species have pattern recognition.
676
They can do things and learn the pattern that this works.
677
There's some cultural transfer, maybe, of looking at someone else doing that pattern, a bird can see another bird.
678
Some species can teach their kids, but they never produce explanations.
679
He has a definition of a good explanation.
680
He's very inspired by Karl Popper as a philosopher.
681
It's his house god.
682
So he takes a bit from Popper.
683
He takes a bit from science.
684
So he says, obviously, that a good explanation has to be falsifiable.
685
But he says a few other things that I think are obvious in retrospect, but not before.
686
He says that a good explanation has to scale.
687
You can have an explanation about, for example, the sun revolving around the Earth, which explains a bunch of stuff, but it doesn't scale to other planets.
688
It's a better explanation, is to have the Earth revolving around the Sun.
689
It just scales better to different scales.
690
So a good explanation has to scale up and down.
691
A good explanation has to be compatible with all the previous explanations.
692
But most interestingly, he says that a good explanation has to be hard to vary.
693
This I find very obvious, but also very non-obvious to people.
694
So what does he mean with a good explanation has to be hard to vary?
695
He means that, for example, if your explanation for the weather on the planet is that now Thor is angry, so there's thunder there, it's an explanation, but it's too easy to vary.
696
You can say, well, now someone else is angry.
697
They also had a hammer.
698
It's too easy to vary and get the same result.
699
A good explanation, if you move one of the parameters, the entire thing is not predictive anymore.
700
Then you're probably close to the truth.
701
I think this is so interesting because the problem with most conspiracy theories that people love is they're so easy to vary.
702
You can just exchange that character for another crazy person and did something crazy, and it's still going to produce the same thing.
703
So if it's too easy to change people in a conspiracy theory, it's probably not true.
704
So I think that's something very powerful.
705
Like good explanations need to be very hard to vary.
706
So this is something I've tried to instill in my org.
707
And I think there's an interesting meta point here, which is people asking as a product person how much of product development is magic and how much is science.
708
And I try to be provocative and saying, I think it's exactly 100% science and 0% magic.
709
And people get provoked because it implies that there's no.
710
What I mean is that certainly people are going to have pattern recognition in this neural network.
711
They've seen a lot of examples.
712
That's what we call seniority.
713
And people have seen a lot of things.
714
They're going to get instinctively to the right conclusion faster than others.
715
So that is valuable.
716
And I want lots of seniority.
717
I don't discard seniority.
718
And it brings you a lot of value.
719
You can save a lot of time, a lot of mistakes.
720
But the reason you call it magic is because that person can't explain it.
721
It isn't actually magic.
722
It's just science.
723
It's just you are not smart enough to explain yourself.
724
If you could think even further and explain it and come up with an explanation for what you see, the way David Dodge does, it's so much more valuable for the company.
725
If you have a theory, instead of saying, no, Patrick, my intuition is this, you're not smart enough to understand it, so I'm not going to tell you, just do what I say.
726
Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong, but it's not very helpful for you.
727
When I leave the company, you're going to take over.
728
You're like, I have no idea why they did that.
729
You have to develop your own intuition and your own pattern recognition.
730
But if I come up with an explanation, which is, I think the psychological behavior of people, you know, it's like Kahneman's loss adversity or prospect theory.
731
I think people value losing something one and a half times the value of getting it.
732
So therefore, we should not just launch feature and test it because it's 1.5x hard, more expensive to remove it.
733
Then you have a theory and it can spread across the company in a week.
734
And now everyone has that.
735
So I really want to force people in my company, even if we see something working in an A-B test, I try to tell them that I don't want to launch it until we at least have a theory of why it works.
736
Even if it's super clear, there's a lot of pressure to launch it because there's engagement, value, and monetization.
737
But I want you to at least have a theory because then over time the company builds up a consumer theory.
738
And if you have a strong consumer theory, then you can predict things.
739
What David Deutsch also says is that pattern recognition will iteratively get you more on the same path, but it's never going to jump all the way from the geocentric to the heliocentric model.
740
Only an explanation can take you to quantum physics, entirely unintuitive.
741
No pattern recognition gets you to maybe it's a wave and a part of that scene.
742
What's an example internally of a great explanation that then led to the geo-to-heliocentric type of jump?
743
What's an example of how that actually played out?
744
I think a good example that is public is the free tier that I told you about.
745
We only had a paid mobile tier.
746
You actually paid to get mobility on Spotify.
747
Now smartphones are scaling, users don't have a computer.
748
We need a free tier.
749
The competition that was YouTube, they were foreground on demand with video.
750
The pattern recognition, the obvious thing would have been to say, let's do that.
751
It's proven.
752
But what we did instead, and specifically attributed to a person named Charlie Hellman, was to reason around it from first principles and say, okay, let's look at our usage of Spotify.
753
If we limited our license to the same thing, it only works in the foreground.
754
As soon as you look at the screen, the music stops.
755
How much of the listening is in the foreground?
756
Turns out back then it was 9% or something.
757
So you have 91% of the use case being in the background.
758
We probably want to get something else.
759
The user needs there is probably background listening.
760
And then you look at the app store.
761
Is there a way to listen to music for free in the background in the app store?
762
The closest thing was Pandora, but that was radio.
763
You could not listen to your favorite songs.
764
So then we said, we would like a consumer product where you can listen to your favorite songs with your phone in the pocket forever for free.
765
So the problem with that is that's almost the premium use case.
766
If we just launch that, it's going to cannibalize.
767
So what do we do?
768
Then we looked at the premium usage and we saw that premium users, about 50% of the time, they were shuffling their playlist.
769
They were using on-demand features, searching and clicking and playing specific songs 50% of the time, but they were shuffling playlists 50%.
770
So then we thought, what if we take this, that seems to be something that even when you have on-demand, you voluntarily shuffle, it's a big use case.
771
We give that away for free.
772
That should mean that none of the premium users convert back to free because they still want their 50% on demand, but you're giving a lot of value away for free.
773
So we try to model the consumer need, reason around it, came up with this shuffle background tier that was very, very, very unintuitive.
774
Even the people inside the company say that's a terrible idea.
775
But we trusted the data, and I was even skeptical of it myself.
776
I was like, look at this on-demand.
777
Shouldn't we try time caps?
778
A lot of people just want us to try long free trials.
779
But the problem with the free trial is, even if Nokia, I think Nokia comes with music, they tried a year-long free trial.
780
But even then, the user knew that if I start investing in playlists now, a year from now, my playlist investment is going to disappear.
781
So they never started investing.
782
So we went with this shuffle tier, and this is what made growth explode.
783
And to this day, that's our differentiation against the other services.
784
It's the only way to listen to music for free forever with your phone and investors.
785
So that's an example of theorizing and explaining rather than patent recognition.
786
I would love to talk about the evolution of the relationship with the music industry.
787
It's a company that unquestionably has wholesale changed music, which is so interesting and so cool.
788
You've been here a long time.
789
Thinking back to the early days, it's amazing the impact that it's had.
790
And from an investor's perspective, one of the things that many were always key in on is just the gross margin of the business, just how much transfer pricing problem are you always going to have?
791
That no matter how big you get, the music industry that owns the IP is just going to always take their same cut of the meat.
792
Talk about how you've thought about that change over time.
793
It seems like it's been both a good relationship for them, but also a very patient path for Spotify.
794
Maybe just give us the insight into how it's worked and how you think about it.
795
Yeah, for sure.
796
I grew up, and Spotify grew up in the era of piracy in Sweden, which was the worst market.
797
And there's this famous quote from a UK label exec to a Swedish label exec around early 2000.
798
The Swedish label exec showed the PL of one of these Swedish companies and they said, that's not a business, that's a hobby.
799
That's how broken it was.
800
And that's actually why Spotify could happen because the music industry was prepared to take risks in Sweden.
801
And I want to give a lot of credit to the music industry.
802
They took a lot of risk with Spotify.
803
Spotify took an enormous amount of risk, an enormous amount of capital risk.
804
We MG'd a lot.
805
We ate a lot of the risk, but certainly they took a lot of risk.
806
I think the music industry certainly deserves the success, as does Spotify.
807
I joined in 2008, somewhere around 2012 or something.
808
I started saying that my team, the RD team, and all of Spotify, we are the RD department of the music industry.
809
And at first, people were like, what do you mean?
810
And I'm like, look at it.
811
It's an entire industry that doesn't have an RD department.
812
Mobile phones has an RD department.
813
It's called, you know, Apple or Google.
814
Everyone has a lot of RD, but there's no RD spend in the music industry.
815
And I think that's turned out to be true.
816
And if you look at the trajectory, this year is the first year of profitability for Spotify since its founding.
817
People say that there's a lot of talk about Spotify sharing enough of the revenue.
818
We share about 70%.
819
But the truth is, the other 30%.
820
We just invested, invested, and invested.
821
So a ton of patience.
822
And at the same time, actually, the music industry has been profitable.
823
Spotify has been unprofitable.
824
I think it's fair to say we are literally the RD department of the music industry.
825
We invested and have had losses for 15 years, and the music industry has been gaining profit.
826
Now, that is not sustainable forever.
827
We needed to get profitable.
828
We can't beat the RD department of the music industry unless we can have the best machine learning engineers, the best product people, developers, et cetera.
829
And for that, you need to be profitable.
830
Turns out these people are expensive because they're sought after.
831
We are a very, very patient and long-term company, and we invested for a long time.
832
But it was just time.
833
About two years ago, we decided now it's time for us to become profitable, to take control of our own fate in terms of being able to invest in ourselves.
834
So, yes, we're profitable, but we're actually investing almost all of that back into more people, more product, more AI.
835
Now we just have our own investment vehicle instead of having to ask private investors initially or the street for more money.
836
So that's how I think about it.
837
Really, as the RD department of the music industry, I think we've done a good job.
838
This year, we paid out over 10 billion, and that's up from 1 billion, I think, almost 10 years ago.
839
It's just steadily increased.
840
The music industry is bigger than it ever was.
841
People still talk about the heyday of the CDs, the CD era.
842
The truth is, the music business is bigger than it was back then.
843
So this is the best it's ever been.
844
It is better than ever, more money than ever.
845
The pie is both bigger and higher, but it's also getting sliced up.
846
But that's because more people take a shot.
847
And it feels very wrong for us to say, no, the creators up until 2020, they were good, but no one should be able to.
848
And I think a way to think about this is people talk about the per-stream payouts and so forth a lot.
849
And Spotify should share more per stream.
850
There are two things that are happening.
851
When other companies say that they share more per stream, the industry doesn't pay per stream.
852
They pay per subscriber.
853
We have more than twice the engagement of our competitive services.
854
So if you take the same $10, you listen twice as much as Spotify, the per stream is half.
855
So these other companies have higher per stream because they have a worse product.
856
We've learned from the labels that we have twice the engagement and half the churn of competing services.
857
So that's a curse.
858
We're the per stream model, just the better we are as a product, the lower the per stream is going to look.
859
But we're looking at the aggregate number and we're leading everyone else there.
860
We're the vast majority of these payouts.
861
So I think if you look overall, the model is working.
862
We took a lot of investment and now the industry is getting a huge return.
863
And Spotify also is profitable now.
864
And the way to grow this pie is now we are closing in on 300 million page subscribers, closing in on 700 million MEUs.
865
There's about 500 million page subscribers, I think, in the world.
866
We're almost 300 of those.
867
But that's half a billion out of the world's population.
868
If you look at markets like Sweden, on average, you can just look at the public numbers, we convert about 40%.
869
But if you look at the mature markets, I won't give you the exact number, but it is much higher.
870
And if you look at the emerging, it's lower.
871
So the average is 40%.
872
That's not the average across the world.
873
That's a blend of low and high converting.
874
And so far, throughout our history, everything starts to look more and more like Sweden the more time passes.
875
So the solution to this is just to scale it faster.
876
Better free tailor that gets more people on, that converts to premium.
877
We think there should be billions.
878
So, let's say that we share 70% today-ish, let's say two-thirds, to make it easier.
879
Even if we were a charity and we paid out 100%, that would only be 1.5x what you get today.
880
So, if you think X pennies per stream is too little, even if we were a charity, it would be 1.5.
881
The solution is not the rev share.
882
We're giving away the vast majority.
883
The solution is to quickly scale the amount of people paying for music.
884
And if you just look at the numbers, you just have to keep going, and it's going to get to billions of users paying, and then several billions.
885
Then, the music industry is absolutely massive.
886
I just think the music industry is undervalued.
887
The terminal is going to be much bigger than it looks.
888
I'm curious how you're thinking about the podcasting world.
889
This is something that we're sitting here doing right now.
890
I've been doing for a long time.
891
Now, it seems we've entered this interesting new era where when I started doing this, I remember it was quite, I would call it low status.
892
When I told people about it in 2016, they either didn't know what it was or thought it was silly.
893
And now, especially in the U.S.
894
with what happened around the election and the importance of podcasts in the election, it seems as though it's hit some tipping point where basically anybody that might make sense to have a podcast now has one or is launching one.
895
And it's the corporate marketing strategy is to get a podcast, and it's the communication strategy is to go on them.
896
So, it's really exploded in importance and visibility.
897
What role has and will Spotify play in all this?
898
And just what do you think about podcasting and its importance?
899
The reason we went into podcasting, one thing that I'm very precious about when it comes to Spotify, and so is Daniel and the other co-president, Alex, who's.
900
And I think your business model to some extent steers you.
901
If you're an advertising business model, mostly you're going to be steered towards any additional engagement.
902
Fortunately for us, we're mostly a subscription-based business model.
903
So we focus more on retention.
904
And you're going to vote with your wallet every month if you want to keep paying for us.
905
We're not as steered towards engagement at any cost.
906
So having been at Spotify for a long time when this happened, one of the things that made me feel very good about Spotify was that when people used it, when they lost an hour on Spotify, they felt very good about it.
907
If you lost an hour on music, you come out feeling like that was a good hour.
908
One of the reasons I really pushed quite hard for podcasting the company was that I was using it myself and a lot of our developers were using it.
909
And I saw it being hacked into the product at Hack Week every year.
910
People wanted them there.
911
We just said, our developers is like a small sample of the world.
912
What if they're a good sample of the world?
913
So that was one push.
914
We saw people using it internally and hacking it.
915
But what made us decide on it was that it was this format.
916
Everything in the world was getting more and more short form.
917
People were bite-sized and attention spans were going down.
918
And it was this counter force, which was long-form discussions, deep.
919
People spoke in full sentences about quantum physics or whatever.
920
And that just felt like something very important and good for the world.
921
And so we looked at it.
922
We saw that it seemed to be growing from a small base.
923
We saw the biggest competitors being asleep at the wheel.
924
We did basically the Peter Thiel idea of it's better to go after small markets early, embed on organic growth than to try to take a small share of a mature market.
925
It looks less risk in the mature market to get 1%.
926
But the thing people miss is the customer acquisition cost in the mature market.
927
So we decided to go for it because we thought it was something that was in line with music.
928
If you lose an hour in a deep podcast, you come out feeling like you learned something.
929
And this is the reason we also went into books because it's in line with that.
930
We want to be this nutritious service.
931
There are two litmus tests for this.
932
One is: if you lose an hour on Spotify, how do you come out feeling versus if you lose an hour doom scrolling in the bathroom?
933
How do you feel about that?
934
In one case, you feel like you ate a lot of candy, like you had a lot of energy in you, but it's bad calories.
935
In the case of Spotify, you feel like you've learned something.
936
The other litmus test that we have is: see a lot of parents restricting screen time for their kids and saying go to Spotify instead, which means that expresses how they feel about it and how we feel about it.
937
So that was one of the reasons to go into podcasts.
938
It was part philosophical, but we also saw the market opportunity of a small market that was poised to grow.
939
And we saw need in early adopters trying to hack it in.
940
And then we did this bet on leveraging our own distribution, combining it with music, saying that the market is this big right now, but what if we could expose podcasts to people who listen to music?
941
Could we grow the market?
942
So that's the bet we did.
943
And the truth is, audiobook is something similar.
944
In the U.S., audiobooks was a very niche behavior, 10, 11 million or something.
945
People who paid for them a la carte.
946
And the idea was that's a limitation because of the business model.
947
When you pay a la carte, you're not going to explore new books at $15 per book cost.
948
Just as in music, when you pay 99 cents per song, you're not going to soundtrack your sleep.
949
It's too expensive at 99 cents per three minutes.
950
But what if we have no marginal cost model where you can just explore?
951
Is audiobook much better?
952
So, again, it was seeing a market that looked pretty small, but you can see in the Nordics where you have the access model that it's getting very mainstream.
953
So, a bet on the market, but it was the same philosophical discussion.
954
Are these good calories?
955
Is this nutritious?
956
Is this in line with Spotify's mission of being the place where you go when you want to feel good about yourself instead of when you want to feel bad about yourself?
957
I remember the very first time I ever talked to Daniel walking along the West Side Highway here many years ago, he talked about this notion of Spotify needing to be better than free.
958
It was a cool idea.
959
If you think about podcasting, it's very different than music.
960
When someone listens to this show on Spotify, you don't owe me anything.
961
How do you think about the way that podcasting, and then obviously books is a little bit maybe more like music, and I'd like to hear how you think about it.
962
How do you think about if that's the supply of the stuff that people are listening to on Spotify or watching on Spotify?
963
The ways in which that affects your business model and the bundle?
964
We didn't know before we started if podcasting and later audiobooks would be cannibalistic to the other media types or not.
965
But it turns out it's not.
966
So, the easiest model to think about it is: Spotify is a bundle now.
967
You pay some price, or you have the advertising based here, and you get a bunch of value.
968
And our job is to try to increase the value you get so you value it more.
969
And then, over time, maybe we can capture some of that value by price raising.
970
We price raised a few times, which is part of why we're profitable now.
971
But that's because we had user surplus in value.
972
That's because we kept just stacking value.
973
And value are two things: value are features like personalization and just a really good product.
974
But the other value is different types of media.
975
So, what we see is that you have a user that uses music, they have a certain amount of control.
976
We haven't run out of time in the background yet.
977
Then, when you add audiobooks, it's just more retention, more time spent, and more willingness to pay.
978
So, that's how we think about it as a business model.
979
Then, on the back end, they have very different business models.
980
I think we may be one of the most complex companies in the world on the back end, because music is a pool-based royalty model.
981
Podcast, as you know, is advertising-based largely, but now we also have this Spotify partner program where you don't have Spotify ads in the premium tier if you're paying, so you get more uninterrupted.
982
So, that's another business model, which is part of the premium bundle.
983
And then you have audiobooks, which the publishing industry works in a third way, very different, where we also have a certain amount of time included in the premium tier, and then a top-up if you run over that.
984
One of the really complicated things about Spotify, I don't think it's appreciated, is on the front end, it's one app, one consumer, you just go between them.
985
But there are very different implications of where you click in that UI in terms of triggering different business models and so forth.
986
So, to model a company financially, it's actually quite hard.
987
We have to predict your user behavior, where you click matters.
988
And we have the personalization that has different impacts in terms of cost and so forth.
989
So, we've had to build a system, we call it the Spotify machine, and that's why I said I have one experience organization, and the job of this experience organization is to make sure that all of this complexity, all of these teams who theoretically could be set up to compete with each other to fix their PL, that never ships to the user.
990
There's one person who is the responsible person for the consumer experience, and that person's job is to make sure that as you go between mobile and desktop, and speakers, the thing makes sense.
991
It's like the gatekeeper against the org, holding them back from the user behind them, protecting the user.
992
But it's also the same in personalization.
993
I have a personalization organization.
994
Because you have the same incentives of programming music versus podcast versus books.
995
Everyone wants to take market share and so forth.
996
So it's the same problem.
997
We have to optimize for the user and sort of protect the user from the internal incentives of teams and business models.
998
That makes Spotify a pretty unique company.
999
We're like one thing on the front end and we're many different things on the back end with different products.
1000
If you think about, let's say, five years from now and you dream as big as you can possibly dream for where Spotify might go from where it is today to where it will be in five years, paint us that picture.
1001
Certainly, I hope we've cracked the billion user line, but as a subscription, I hope we're becoming one of the biggest media subscriptions in the world and we add more and more value to that.
1002
So hopefully music is bigger than it ever was.
1003
I'm hoping that audiobooks is a mainstream phenomenon as it is in Scandinavia where there's almost as many people listen to music as audiobooks.
1004
I think that would be a net good for the world.
1005
But I also hope we've added a few more of these verticals.
1006
We can't say what they are.
1007
The subscription model, the bundling model that we didn't talk so much about, we can differentiate on product or on content, but largely we tend to license commodity content.
1008
We don't work with exclusivities, at least not anymore.
1009
We tried in podcasts for a while.
1010
So you can differentiate on the product and consumption of the commodity content, but you can also differentiate on the offering.
1011
So for example, if you look at Spotify now versus other offerings, some other offerings have the same music, some other offerings have some on the same podcast.
1012
So, to use bundling theory to create more and more of a differentiated, unique thing that is Spotify, I think is very exciting.
1013
And I think you will see more innovation on the bundling business model in addition to the product.
1014
I'm the product guy, but I'm very interested in business models.
1015
I've been a CEO myself.
1016
So, I think you will see a lot of innovation there.
1017
What's the key to a good bundle?
1018
And I'm also curious, you said you experimented with exclusive content that was only available on platform and less of that now.
1019
What drives a decision like that?
1020
And how do you think about other people that might want to create a bundle somewhere else?
1021
When we looked at podcasts, you look at something like Netflix, and it's this beautiful business model and insanely good execution as well on top of that.
1022
And it looked to us like that could be interesting.
1023
I think when you're a product company that works with commodity content, you always have this environment of what if we could differentiate through content, then life is going to be super easy.
1024
You always think the other thing that someone else is doing is easy and your thing is hard, and it's usually very hard to do the other thing.
1025
So, we tried exclusivity in podcasts as a way to differentiate this service, but I think it was ultimately a bad bet because the macro trend for the whole thing with podcasts was that the production cost was so low.
1026
Joe Rogan was initially sitting in this trailer, the production cost was low.
1027
And then go in and do exclusivities on top of that is kind of counter-purpose in a way.
1028
The whole point is more like YouTube, in that this is very cheap content, so you can get a lot of it.
1029
You don't have to be right.
1030
As soon as you go into the exclusivity game, you got to be right.
1031
You got to be a content picker.
1032
And that's a very hard skill that Netflix does extremely well.
1033
But we have this opportunity.
1034
And there wasn't this capital-intensive need there that there is in producing costume dramas.
1035
This is a bad strategic decision that we did.
1036
We also betted a lot on celebrities, and they are celebrities, but they're not always good podcast hosts.
1037
And the podcast hosts that were really good, they grew up through this organic system.
1038
So there are two ways to always be right.
1039
One is to always guess right.
1040
The other is to just change your mind whenever you're wrong.
1041
So we decided to change our mind and say, this looks like the age of syndication.
1042
Creators actually want to be everywhere.
1043
They create a video or they create music.
1044
They want to be everywhere.
1045
Okay, let's embrace that.
1046
I mean, music, we were always a platform.
1047
We never played with exclusivity.
1048
We said, we want the maximum catalog.
1049
Books, we're doing maximum catalog.
1050
Let's just embrace that in podcasts as well.
1051
So we pivoted strategy.
1052
Save us a lot of cost, which is part of what we're doing well.
1053
And it's also improved the catalog greatly.
1054
And now we're on a really good trajectory with our podcast viewing.
1055
So it was an example of that strategy.
1056
And I think the important thing is to admit it and change your mind.
1057
The real cost is when you try to defend your past experience.
1058
It's a bad idea.
1059
What things do you do outside of Spotify in your life that most prepare you or make you capable to do the best job that you can in Spotify?
1060
I think the world is moving very fast.
1061
So a lot of my time is just trying to keep up with what is happening.
1062
I was on a vacation in Lisbon with my family recently.
1063
And I spent a lot of time with them, seeing Lisbon, which is a beautiful city.
1064
Then I asked them for one day off from work and off from the family to just indulge myself.
1065
This time it was going back to trying to code a bit, use all these new tools, stay on top of what's happening.
1066
It's a combination of keeping up with what is happening, which is hard because it's moving so fast, but also stimulate myself mentally.
1067
I have to have something that I'm excited about at any point in time.
1068
And it can be new things, like AI and what it would mean.
1069
But it can be age-old things that I just didn't know, like learning more about physics or math or something.
1070
I've read a lot of philosophy for a while because it's just an interesting area.
1071
You think through all the big questions of intelligence and consciousness and all of those things.
1072
And you can spend 10 years there just reading all of that.
1073
And now I feel capped out a little bit.
1074
When you start reading, you're like, yeah, I'm going to crack this.
1075
And then it turns out I didn't crack it.
1076
People have been trying to crack consciousness for a while, but it's so deeply interesting.
1077
It kept me excited about life for a very long time.
1078
I was never a big math person in school.
1079
I was okay, but not great.
1080
But I found myself getting very excited about math the older I got.
1081
As you start reading a bit of philosophy, you get into things like Goethe's incompleteness theorem and constructive mathematics and these things that they're loosely related to work.
1082
But they keep you energized.
1083
But they keep me energized.
1084
Actually, it turns out a lot of my product people and engineers are deeply interested in these things.
1085
So I just have something very interesting to talk to people around me about.
1086
And then I do sports.
1087
I do Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu with my kids, which is very rewarding.
1088
What does that tell you?
1089
Humbleness.
1090
You come in and you think you do something and you get absolutely smashed by someone half your size and they're not even sweating.
1091
And you're like, okay, technique matters.
1092
It's technique.
1093
It's leverage.
1094
Yeah.
1095
The beautiful thing about Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is that the belt thing is real.
1096
There's a long story behind it, but the net is that Japanese person both.
1097
There was one brother that was just underdeveloped versus the others.
1098
He was just not very strong.
1099
So he could not beat his brothers.
1100
So he started taking Japanese jiu-jitsu and figuring out how he could just use physics, just leverage.
1101
And slowly, slowly, he started beating all his brothers, and that became Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.
1102
So it was literally, he had to solve the problem.
1103
He could not use power.
1104
I didn't know that.
1105
And then this family put up all these competitions.
1106
I like it from an evolutionary product point of view.
1107
They said, okay, anyone come here, karate, kickboxing, just try it.
1108
Open.
1109
They fought in these basements, just evolving the sport, proving that it was real.
1110
A lot of martial arts, it's magic and secret, and they never test their skills.
1111
It works very well in practice.
1112
The other thing I like about it is that I've done a lot of other martial arts, boxing and tieboxing and stuff.
1113
Those things are great as exercise, but for self-protection, it's not very good.
1114
You cannot punch someone in the face.
1115
You're going to get sued.
1116
That's protection.
1117
The beautiful thing about martial arts, which is called the gentle sport, is you control people, you constrain them, and you can adapt the level of violence.
1118
This is why police use jiu-jitsu and not tieboxing, because you can regulate the violence to the other person.
1119
You can control them without hurting them.
1120
So that's why I think everyone should use it and practice it.
1121
It's good both for self-discipline because you get humbled, it's also actually useful and you can use it without harming other people.
1122
People probably don't know this because how would they?
1123
But Spotify, you and Daniel especially, have been probably the most influential people and certainly the company on me and how I've thought about building our businesses over time.
1124
And a lot of that comes back to the stuff that you don't see.
1125
You were the first person years ago to describe the Betsboard concept to me, and we've used that very effectively.
1126
And so many lessons from Daniel on how to think about what matters to users.
1127
And I think Spotify is not only an incredible product, but it's also one where the product is a reflection of the company behind it.
1128
And I think it's one worth studying by listening to conversations like this one.
1129
Because for me, what it's done is raised the bar of ambition and the standard for excellence of how a company should be constructed to mirror the needs that it has, its unique needs, but also just the character and the discipline of the people running it.
1130
So it's been so fun to do this with you.
1131
And thank you so much for all the lessons over the years.
1132
Well, you know, the closing question that I have for everyone: what is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you?
1133
The thing that made me really excel in my role was being allowed to take a lot of risk by Daniel.
1134
So I've actually screwed up a bunch of things in Spotify that didn't work.
1135
And I never felt that I was going to get fired for it.
1136
And he actually encouraged that, and I got the second chance.
1137
And that's what made me have the higher ambition instead of holding back for risk or failure.
1138
So I think it's a series of those things, being allowed to mess up things, that has probably had the biggest impact on my professional career.
1139
Can you give an example of a bad mistake that you made and how he and the org made you feel through that process so that you could be re-emboldened to take more risk again?
1140
I was interested in new user interfaces.
1141
Many years ago, I took the company very hard on a journey for an interface that at the time was very provocative.
1142
The idea was Spotify just starts playing things.
1143
You swipe up to get to the next genre, and you swipe left or right to get other things within the same genre.
1144
And now you would say that sounds almost like TikTok.
1145
This was before musically.
1146
But two things happened.
1147
It was very...
1148
provocative.
1149
It started playing things without you asking.
1150
So people were upset, but I pushed pretty hard because I was convinced that immediacy, the idea was you just sound your way to what you want to hear in a very low-friction interface.
1151
And it was maybe a decent idea, but it was before machine learning.
1152
It just did not work at all.
1153
You could just not get there.
1154
And we built this.
1155
It was called Moments, the UI.
1156
We used editors on the back end, which just did not work at all.
1157
So the idea was far, far ahead of where the technology was.
1158
And it costed a lot of money.
1159
We actually announced it.
1160
There is a video of us presenting this user interface and so forth.
1161
People luckily forgot it, but it just didn't work.
1162
We had A-B tested it, and it looked okay, which is what we launched.
1163
Then we discovered there was a bug in the A-B test.
1164
Oh my God.
1165
And when it was live, and it actually underperformed drastically what we had.
1166
So we had to roll it back.
1167
And I had taken the entire organization on this excursion at lost a year or something in a very competitive business.
1168
That was a good opportunity to get fired.
1169
And I didn't.
1170
Daniel was like, I understand, I agree with the thoughts and the ideas.
1171
What was the mistake?
1172
And the mistake was the machine learning was not there.
1173
We were not good enough to get you there in enough swipes.
1174
And he was more like Jeff Bezos.
1175
And that's just the inputs, not the outputs.
1176
If the inputs are bad, if the ideas are fuzzy and stupid, that's a problem.
1177
But you're not going to be always right, even with good ideas.
1178
And I heard him say this, Jeff Bezos' quote, I judge you by the inputs you had, not the outputs.
1179
Because the problem with judging the outputs is you could just get lucky.
1180
If they're structured ideation and execution, events you can get right.
1181
So it just got more chances.
1182
And that made me actually take more risk instead of scaling down on the risk.
1183
But I felt very, very, very burned for a long time.
1184
There are jokes internally about moments.
1185
What a powerful story and mindset for us all to adopt.
1186
Such a great closing story, Gustav.
1187
Thanks so much for your time.
1188
Thanks for having me.
