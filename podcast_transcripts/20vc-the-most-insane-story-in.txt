1
I don't know what is financial discipline.
2
So I don't have a budget.
3
I'm just like hire as fast as possible, blow it all up.
4
And I realized at one point that we're running out of money.
5
Every month I'm raising money, basically.
6
So we went from zero to a billion-dollar transaction volume within like nine months.
7
So we basically never grow below 100% from 2015 to 2023.
8
We went to like $500 million AR in August last year, then hit like 600 in November, and 700 in sort of January Fab.
9
Air Wallocks is the most insane story in startups of the last decade.
10
I went for a walk in the park with their founder, Jack Zhang, a month ago, and I literally couldn't believe it.
11
It was insane hearing so many different parts.
12
From the angel investor that turned $1 million into what will be a billion-dollar gain, to the renowned global VC firm that pulled the term sheet and lost what will be a billion-dollar gain to the company failing on their first three products, to turning down a $1.2 billion acquisition offer from Stripe when they had just 2 million in revenue, to hitting a billion in revenue by the end of this year, and they've grown 100% every single year for the last eight years.
13
This is one of the great startup stories of our time.
14
And I'm so thrilled to welcome Jack Zhang, co-founder and CEO of Air Wallocks, one of the world's fastest-growing global payments and financial infrastructure companies.
15
But before we dive into the show today, I love seeing the team come together to make this show happen.
16
What I don't love is trying to keep track of all the information, the data, and the projects that we're working on across dozens of platforms, products, and tools.
17
That's why we use Coda, the all-in-one collaborative workspace that's helped 50,000 teams all over the world get on the same page, offering the flexibility of docs with the Intelligence of Coda Brain, is a game changer.

22
That's codacoda.io slash 20vc and get six months off the team plan for free.
23
Coda.io slash 20vc.
24
And while coda keeps the engine running smoothly, Shopify puts the pedal to the metal when it's time to sell.
25
When I was 18, I dreamed about being an investor with zero contacts in the industry, and through persistence, I'm now living that dream.
26
Maybe you're dreaming of your own business, and that's where Shopify steps in.
27
I spend my time exploring successful businesses online.
28
Often, there's a business behind the business driving success.
29
For millions, that's Shopify, powering 10% of US commerce.
30
Shopify offers beautiful templates, AI tools for product images and descriptions, easy marketing campaigns, and 24/7 support.
31
Their number one checkout boosts conversions by 50%, fewer abandoned carts, more sales.
32
Winner, turn dreams into success with Shopify.
33
Go to shopify.com/slash 20.com.
34
And while Shopify helps you make the sale, Gusto makes sure your team gets paid without the headache.
35
Look, payday is awesome, but running payroll, calculating taxes and deductions, staying compliant, it's not easy.
36
Unless, of course, you have Gusto.
37
Gusto is a simple online payroll and benefits tool built for small businesses like yours.
38
Gusto gets your team paid while automatically filing your payroll taxes.
39
Zi Yang, CEO of video game studio Serenity Forge, said Gusto was the first step in turning their basement project into a real company.
40
It helped them scale globally, saving him 30 hours a month and letting him focus on building great games instead of doing boring admin.
41
Plus, you can offer benefits like 401k, health insurance, and workers' comp.
42
Just for listening today, you also get three months free.
43
Go to gusto.com forward slash 20vc.
44
That's gusto.com forward slash 20vc.
45
You have now arrived at your destination.
46
Jack, dude, I'm so excited for this.
47
Listen, we walked around the park and I heard your story.
48
And respectfully, I was like, this is such an incredible story that I don't think many people know quite how awesome it is.
49
So first, thank you so much for joining me.
50
Thanks, Harry.
51
It's a great pleasure to join this show.
52
Normally, I don't love the whole like, oh, take me back to your childhood because it's normally like, you know, going back to the early days of Stanford.
53
But you started in Australia, and I want to start actually very young.
54
Because you started, was it working at a petrol station?
55
Can you just take me back to the first job and that early time?
56
I came to Australia when I was.
57
And this, you know, I went basically started high school, and my family basically lost most of the money.
58
And I lost financial support when I was 16.
59
And I had to basically figure out how to survive in a foreign country by myself.
60
That's why I started working in a restaurant, working in a lemon factory.
61
You worked in a lemon factory?
62
Yeah, that's during summer.
63
You know, I go basically take a few hours of train and buses to get on the mountain every day and to literally carrying lemon, you know, thousands of lemon bucks a day under the, you know, 40 degrees and for two hours a day without even eating lunch.
64
How much did they pay you at the lemon factory?
65
They actually pay okay.
66
They pay like 14 bucks Aussie an hour.
67
And because you kind of can work over the 20 hours limit during the holiday, and it's actually a pretty decent income, but it's just a really, really tough job.
68
Nervous/slash scared.
69
You're 16, 17 at this point, on your own in a foreign country without financial security.
70
It's a pretty intimidating place to be.
71
Well, I guess it's just a situation that you don't have a choice.
72
You know, I left China where I was born and came to Australia.
73
By that time, I was already in Australia for over a year.
74
I couldn't go back to China to do the exam to the universities because I wouldn't be that competitive anymore.
75
I don't even know how to return to the education system by that time.
76
And literally, you have to figure out how to, you know, survive and how to pay for the tuitions, which is very expensive for international students.
77
I remember it's $24,000 a year.
78
And you have to, you know, just really work as many jobs as possible to figure out how to live on my own.
79
There's going to be a great visual that my team's going to make of a lemon factory in you.
80
So, what happens there?
81
We are earning $14 an hour in a lemon factory.
82
We're working in restaurants.
83
What's the next step?
84
You go to university?
85
Take me to this time.
86
Yeah, so I went to the University of Melbourne, and that's where I met with my three co-founders.
87
And I also work different jobs throughout the college.
88
And I was working in a restaurant as a dishwasher, work in a Western hotel as a bartender.
89
I basically work between 4:00 to 11:30 in a bar.
90
And once that's finished, I started working at a petrol station from midnight to 8 a.m.
91
So I literally work 16 hours straight, four or five days a week.
92
What were you doing in the petrol station?
93
That's just doing overnight shift and sitting there doing, caching the people paying the petrol and selling lollies.
94
And so selling lollies.
95
That is the most random thing to sell in the petrol station.
96
You know, like you go to petrol station and be like, oh, you know, do you want to just, you know, pay for five bucks for three chocolate and you know, that type of stuff?
97
That's me.
98
Do you know what?
99
I don't actually drive.
100
I don't know if you know this, I haven't passed my test.
101
It's one of my many flaws.
102
And so petrol station is not something I know too well, but I will go for a lolly.
103
So we're there.
104
We're at Melbourne University this time, and we've met our three co-founders at this point, correct?
105
I met one out of the three co-founders when I got into University of Melbourne in the first year.
106
So we went to basically the same faculty and we all started computer science.
107
My CTO, Jacob, he's like one year older than me.
108
Do you start tinkering on ideas together then when you're doing CS together?
109
I mean, they spend most of the time playing Dota and then competing against each other.
110
And I was pretty suck at playing Dota, to be fair.
111
And I was literally, you know, I spent most of my time working, little time in a university.
112
I kind of just try to spend as much as I can, but I wasn't like the best student in my college.
113
Compared to my high school, I was like the top, top student of the school, where at university I was just like an average student because I just didn't spend enough time to study.
114
Dude, you're working 16 hours a day.
115
I mean, poor you, university is like the side gig.
116
So what was the first thing that you started?
117
If I say to you, like your first entrepreneurial thing, what was your first entrepreneurial thing?
118
So I started a magazine called Urban Exploration when I was back in high school.
119
I was like 13, 14, together with the student in the sort of student society.
120
And everyone is obviously working for free.
121
And, you know, we need to raise money for student funding.
122
And I need to figure out how to do that.
123
And we were essentially going to the restaurants and computer shops and stuff around the school to raise money.
124
And they were like, oh, why don't you just send some flyer up just for, you know, $2 per person and we'll give you some money.
125
But we kind of, nobody wants to take flyers.
126
Who cares?
127
So that we thought we might just write something more interesting and put those ads for those restaurants in the essentially a magazine or booklet we created.
128
And then hopefully that people will be interested to take it.
129
But because we write quite interesting stories, like student love stories, how to play like Counter-Strike, and because.
130
And because we kind of printed out of the school for free and we didn't have any costs, and we have very limited print, and everyone kind of wants a copy of it.
131
And I think over like a year and a half, we got like 8,000 merchants that put ads on the magazine.
132
And we actually made a decent amount of money.
133
Then, obviously, we kind of donated to the school.
134
Kind of a massive early success in my, I would say, when I grew up, you know, before I came to Australia.
135
Do you think people are born entrepreneurs, or do you think you can become one when you think back to that as a 13, 14-year-old?
136
I think when you grow up, that if you taste, you know, what success looks like early, you know, whether it's spot or any type of math competition or Olympic competition or any type of competition or any sort of team spots, the tough experience, you know, when I kind of lost financial support and when my family kind of lost most of the money, that really toughened you up, right?
137
You become quite resilient.
138
And when you're working 100 hours a week at this age and had to go through that mental challenge of figuring your life out at such a young age, I think you become a lot more resilient.
139
People ask, you know, I get burned out, I mean, I'm just, you know, working too hard and blah, blah, blah.
140
I'm like, what are you talking about?
141
You know, do you know what a tough life looks like?
142
You know, like, in Australia, especially, you know, it's a very wealthy country in general.
143
And there's less people who have experienced tough things in life.
144
And generally, people have a different perspective on what life is, right?
145
So funny for me.
146
I work seven days a week and three years.
147
And now I did 100 hours a week for about 20 years, dude.
148
And you still look about 25.
149
Well, I kind of look a bit old now, but.
150
And the amazing thing is that you did that on things you didn't love.
151
Like, I've done 100 hours a week for star for 10 years, but dude, mine is like in cushy offices with lovely things around me.
152
You did shit jobs to our fans in the early years, working insane hours.
153
That's also what's insane.
154
Like lemon factories and rats.
155
I didn't enjoy those jobs, right?
156
So when I was working in the lemon factory, have, you know, under the 40-degree sun and carrying these boxes or washing dishes, I mean, I'm thinking about one day, you know, I don't want to do this anymore.
157
I want to do a real proper job.
158
I want to write code.
159
The show has been very successful, I think, but also because I'm very open about my life.
160
I saw my grandparents lose everything, lose their home overnight.
161
You lose all security as a family.
162
And it's very jarring.
163
I'm always actually running from that.
164
The reason I work so ferociously hard is because I don't want my family to ever be in that place.
165
That's why I'm working so hard, if I'm honest.
166
Are you running from that financial insecurity still?
167
Or do you think you're running towards something, if I were to ask you?
168
I think that you have different phases in life, right?
169
So that's kind of why I started Air Wallocks.
170
You know, I basically, after I graduated, I went to work at Aviva.
171
I worked at a bunch of investment banks as a developer/slash, you know, algorithmic trader.
172
And when I was doing those jobs, and I really enjoyed writing code, but that's not enough to give me the financial.
173
I was importing, exporting businesses for exporting olive oils and wine from Australia.
174
So you had an import.
175
Tell me about what?
176
Yeah, so I basically exporting olive oil and wine of Australia to China and other countries.
177
And I was importing textiles from China to Australia.
178
And I had a business of real estate development.
179
I have a business of architecture and project management.
180
And I have all these side businesses that, to be frank, are generating millions of income every year, passively.
181
Obviously, I work full-time.
182
I work pretty hard in my job.
183
And I work another six, seven, eight hours, and I work all the weekends for my side hustle.
184
You know, make $200,000 a year on my full-time job.
185
And I make two, three, four, five million dollars a year on the other side hustle as kind of that business is getting more mature.
186
Dude, how the fuck did you do that?
187
Two, three, four, I mean, that's real money when you are full-time working at a Viva or as an algo trader and then you're doing an import-export business of olive oil.
188
That's not an easy business to do, is it?
189
It's actually pretty easy.
190
You know, you think about it, right?
191
Tell me.
192
You literally just find a supplier, find a buyer, and you're not a producer, you don't need to do any marketing.
193
It's just B2B, right?
194
You just, all you need to do is finding buyers and sellers.
195
And I was, and at one stage, I was a reseller of phone cases.
196
You know, I found like an Australian manufacturer.
197
Well, not manufacturers, more like a brand creator called Qualoc.
198
Essentially, now it's a private equity-owned business.
199
It actually went pretty big.
200
And I work with those guys that are designers.
201
I just have a lot of these side businesses that are making money.
202
At one stage, come back to the financial insecurity.
203
I probably made like more than $10 million when I was 28, 29.
204
And I had financial security.
205
At that time, my real estate business is getting real scale, right?
206
You know, we're starting building like 40, 50 apartments, 40, 50 million Aussie dollar project.
207
You know, I wasn't from time involved in anything, but that's kind of the direction of it.
208
You just got people to run them for you.
209
Yeah.
210
And one of the guys running that for me was my co-founder, Max Lee.
211
He's the head of product design.
212
He went, become an architect and then started a real estate business with me, started a coffee shop with me, and which we found the foreign exchange and international payments issue.
213
That's led us to funding AirWallocks.
214
But we had financial security at the time.
215
And me and Max was basically just in a coffee shop and thinking about like, we cannot doing this for the, you know, just make money for the rest of our life.
216
Right.
217
And we wanted to create real scale business leveraging technology.
218
You know, I went to college when I see like Facebook took off.
219
I don't know if you know, like, we don't use Facebook when we were in college.
220
We were like MySpace, there's like Hi Friends, Friendster.
221
Facebook was not a thing.
222
And we just see that shoot off, right?
223
I mean, Google was not even a massive company back then.
224
And we just saw the whole internet took off.
225
And especially like, you also saw the internet in China took off to the early 2000s.
226
So the like of Tencent and WeChat and Alipay and Alibaba all took off.
227
And you just live in this time that a lot of the generational companies get created.
228
But before we just go to the founding of Airwallets there, you have all of these side businesses.
229
How do you think about the importance of focus?
230
Because when I hear people with lots of side businesses, I'm always like, why didn't you just focus on the real estate company?
231
You could have made that 10x bigger.
232
How do you think about the importance of focus versus when it's worth it to have a portfolio?
233
Because I need to really enjoy and passionate about what I do.
234
And I'm not passionate or enjoy any of this business that I started.
235
I always say that just like a business that I'm making money.
236
And I'm, you know, not interested.
237
Obviously, I want a financial security, but making money is not going to make you happy.
238
I wanted to leverage my engineering skill set to create real, you know, amplified impact at scale.
239
And so I started probably 10 plus businesses.
240
And what I really conclude is I don't like any of them.
241
I still wanted to pursue what's going to make me excited and passionate about.
242
And that's kind of leading to the whole founding story of Airwalls.
243
I feel sorry for many people today because I think so many people actually don't find what they truly love.
244
I'm so lucky, honestly, Jack.
245
I found Venture when I was 13 years old by watching the social network.
246
That's how I got exposed to Venture.
247
I'm very lucky that I found that because it's.
248
Well, it took me a decade, right?
249
I started when I was, I mean, if you count in the early days, I mean, more than a decade, right?
250
You started washing dishes and petrol station and lemon factory, then you go from like there to like import, exporting.
251
You go from trading, you go from like architecture, real estate, and coffee shop.
252
I mean, all that kind of lead to is a bigger idea that you feel passionate about.
253
So take me to the moment where you found that passion, where you're like, you know what?
254
I've tried these 10 businesses, but this is the thing.
255
I keep my job of writing code, even though I'm making 10 times money on the site.
256
So I never resigned.
257
I never thought about resigning because I need to write code every day.
258
So I feel that one day when I actually want to start a business, I can still create something.
259
You know, when we run in the coffee business, the idea was not really running the coffee business.
260
The initial idea was that, okay, we need to basically, I would look at like, you know, in Australia, there's a biggest teleco called Telstra.
261
And Telstra publishing the fast 50 growing company every year in Australia.
262
And more than half those companies are retail businesses, like, you know, Burger Chain or CoffeeChain or some sort of these retail chains.
263
And I started like a burger chain and I started like a coffee chain.
264
I mean, when I say chain, it's only just really one business at a time and was supposed to become a chain.
265
But during that setting up process, the first problem we found is that there's no square equivalent in sort of 2013.
266
You know, the whole point of sales, payments, order management, you know, back of the kitchen, the ordering system, the delivery system, nothing was really set up.
267
So I was like, I should start basically a square, you know, plus the whole kind of back-end order management system.
268
And I pitched the idea to my CTO, you know, Jacob, you know, like, and I was like, dude, like, let's do something together.
269
I think this is a real opportunity.
270
And that time, also, NFC, you know, the touch payment started sort of changing the consumer payment behavior.
271
I was like, let's build something that can support NFC payments and let's go into build this point of sale system and payment system for offline merchants.
272
And he's like, oh, no, no, like, I think.
273
And he, you know, he just started the AI business 10 years too early.
274
And he's like, you know, I don't believe this whole NFC thing.
275
He's like, QR is going to take over the world.
276
We should build a QR thing.
277
And I was like, nobody using QR.
278
I never heard of this thing.
279
I mean, this is like a very China thing.
280
And I don't think so.
281
And then we kind of just debated.
282
Then we ended up just can't agree on that idea.
283
And then we let it go.
284
I mean, that could be another billion-dollar startup, you know, in 2013.
285
And we'll just keep you in the coffee business.
286
And halfway through, and when we launched the coffee business, then we were essentially importing bins from Brazil, from Indonesia, and importing packages from China.
287
And payment is the real issue.
288
And my co-founder's name is Max Lee.
289
The same name is on the OFAC blacklist.
290
So whoever that he's sending a payment using his personal name, because at that time, we're still using personal name to sending money around the world.
291
And his payment just got blocked somewhere in the middle because it's going through the SWIFT network and bounced back after two months.
292
And he just keeps complaining to me, like, why am I sending a payment to Brazil and take like two months for the payment to come back?
293
And I really look under the hood, it's like, what is this SWIFT thing that built in the 1970s and how does SWIFT work?
294
So if you're sending money from, say, NetWest, you know, to a bank in Brazil, like a small bank in Brazil, that, you know, they're not going to have a bilateral relationship.
295
Essentially, they go through the Swift network.
296
There's a lot of intermediary, the large global banks that have dominated that kind of relationship.
297
So essentially, NetWest will go to Barclays, Barclays will go to Citi, Citi go to Itawu, and Itaw will go to this smaller bank in Brazil.
298
And it's like everything that the smaller the country is, the more counterparty in the middle involved, and they charge a higher fee and slow down the process.
299
And there's a more complicated, complex process because, you know, the SWIFT messages only contain 140 characters.
300
You can't really put a lot of information to reduce false positive.
301
And I was just like, this just doesn't make any sense.
302
Why this thing being existed for 50 years and processing trillion dollars every day?
303
Why can't we fundamentally build a new system to help people to move money, just like you're moving information, again, data?
304
If the data on the internet is real-time, why money is not?
305
Essentially, it's data.
306
It's a ledger, right?
307
I get you, Jack.
308
But what happens then?
309
Because as you said, Swift created in the 1970s one of the most concrete architectures, which we don't really question.
310
I mean, we still send Swift payments today.
311
Well, I mean, they're still dominating the payment world today.
312
So, what happens then?
313
You're like, hey, this is broken.
314
We should have another way.
315
What do you do next?
316
Initially, I thought, well, let's just do point-to-point, right?
317
If you have like people want to send money from Australia to Brazil, and you have people from Brazil want to send it to Australia, and you can kind of just net it off, right?
318
And that's the initial idea we raised our seed route.
319
But when we actually build the algorithm and we realize the amount of volume we needed to make that take off, you know, it's like billions of billions, right?
320
And we're just never going to work.
321
I don't even know how to get a hundred million volume.
322
Where do I get the bills?
323
And then at the end of the day, we just raise the money.
324
So you have the idea, hey, I want to reinvent the Swift network.
325
I want to change payments.
326
And at that point, before you build product, you go and raise money?
327
Well, this is another funny story.
328
So when I was doing the COVID business and I was thinking about starting Air Wallocks at the time, and one day I just finished work on Friday.
329
I went to the coffee shop to catch up with Max, you know, another co-founder of Air Wallocks.
330
And I said, I'm going to resign, let's just do this seriously.
331
And I met a girl who is a friend of Max called Lucy, who just resigned from an investment banker and wanted to get married and have a family in Australia.
332
And just sort of, you know, hit up with her.
333
And, you know, she's kind of curious about the coffee business.
334
She's like, oh, I want to talk to you more about the coffee business and maybe I can invest in this coffee business.
335
And then, like, we said, oh, let's just grab dinner, right?
336
So we grabbed dinner and then she's like, and then, you know, blah, blah, coffee business.
337
I was like, actually, you know what?
338
I'm actually going to really stop keeping investing in this coffee business.
339
I'm going to start a new business that really revolutionizes cross-border payments and fundamentally changing how money moves around the world.
340
And then she's like, oh, tell me more about it.
341
And, you know, because I was like, oh, I have a background in FX, and I'm an engineer.
342
And my co-founder was like a genius engineer.
343
You know, I made a pitch.
344
And she's like, how much money you're raising?
345
I'm like, oh, I'm probably going to raise a million US.
346
And she's like, what about if I give you 2 million?
347
This is a girl that you met for the first time in your life.
348
And you only talked for like less than an hour.
349
And then she's like, offering you $2 million.
350
I was like, for how much of the company?
351
He was like, I'll give you $2 million for 40% of the company.
352
Initially, my reaction was, should I take it seriously?
353
But then she's, let's really kind of have a deeper conversation in law school tomorrow.
354
So law school is the, you know, from University of Melbourne, because she also went to University of Melbourne.
355
So for all four of us went to the same college.
356
She's like, let's meet at like eight o'clock tomorrow and we.
357
So, we went to the law school on, I remember Saturday, this is like the second day I met her.
358
And she basically negotiated with me for three hours by 11 o'clock.
359
And we agreed that she's going to invest a million because I don't want to own 40% of the company.
360
She's going to invest a million dollar, a five million dollar post for 20% of the company.
361
And her husband was there strongly against it.
362
And she's like, we're going to use this money to buy houses and we're going to have a family.
363
What are you doing?
364
She's like, I'm king, and I actually wanted to join these guys.
365
And, you know, and she just pushed that through.
366
And we just end up agreed verbally that we're going to do the deal.
367
The crazy thing is, this is before even I resigned from my full-time job in ANZ.
368
And this is before I even have a company registered.
369
Then, like, by Monday, I got a text message from my bank account.
370
Like, you got a million US dollar wire to your personal bank account.
371
Like, obviously, I'll give her the bank account, but like, I just didn't expect that she would just wire without anything signed.
372
Wow.
373
And so then you put the paperwork in place.
374
Yeah, and I, you know, that took like months.
375
Yeah.
376
So, like, literally, I got the money three days, you know, over the weekend after the first time I met her.
377
And that ended up probably one of the best investments people ever made.
378
I mean, this is like a girl that, I don't know, 25 years old or 24 and never made any investment.
379
This is her first investment.
380
On a $9 billion valuation, if you assume a reasonable dilution, you're turning a $1 million there into a billion.
381
Yeah.
382
I mean, it's crazy.
383
And I kind of just.
384
I'm going to give her.
385
That is insane.
386
I think she made a few other investments and then didn't turn out to be good afterwards.
387
And I think she stopped investing.
388
That is insane.
389
Oh my gosh.
390
Okay.
391
So you get a million wired to your personal account, which nowadays would be like, you know, a challenging compliance problem, by the way.
392
But you have a million wire to your account and you get to work.
393
What happens then?
394
I resigned.
395
I literally got the money and I resigned the same day.
396
Dude, I loved this.
397
So you resign, you go to Max, and you're like, right, let's do this.
398
Let's get to work on our Wallocks.
399
Yeah, and I, there's a Space Co-founder, which is Keylock, and I used to work together.
400
I basically, you know, like kind of forced him to resign because he was like, got three kids, you know, like a lot of obligation.
401
And he's one of the best engineers I know.
402
And we worked together in National Australia Bank.
403
And so basically, me, Max, and Lucy, we just like went to the downstairs of the net building.
404
It was like, we're not going to leave until you resign.
405
So go resign.
406
And she was stuck there for two hours talking to his manager, which is also my previous manager.
407
And I was like, I know that you're going to get returned because you're one of the best engineers they ever had.
408
And but dude, we're not going to leave until you resign, whatever that time is.
409
So go fucking get resigned.
410
And he did.
411
Deal with your wife later.
412
We kind of like literally forced him to resign.
413
Were you nervous at all about leaving the safety net, going all in on our wallocks?
414
Was there ever a part of you that was like, this is real?
415
I'm leaving security.
416
Yeah, I mean, like, and also, right?
417
I just we just live in like a 10-square meter office.
418
Like we sleep in a sleeping bag and we're just working there 20 hours a day running code.
419
You slept in a sleeping bag?
420
Yeah, like me and Max and Jacob, three of us literally, you know, obviously kind of hard for Lucy, the girl, to fit in, but like, you know, three of us like would literally, and Max are actually four of us, and we'll just like live in office.
421
Okay, so we've got a million dollars, you've got the four of you, and now you're just building product at this stage, correct?
422
And then raising money, because I don't think the million is enough.
423
Yeah, the million is not going to get you very far.
424
Yeah, so we raised another $2 million from a VC in Hong Kong.
425
Because all the VCs kind of rejected me in Australia.
426
It was only three VC.
427
It's so funny, though.
428
Let's just go to that.
429
So Australian VCs rejected you.
430
So what happens?
431
You go out, you don't have product at this time, but you've got the million dollars from Lucy.
432
And so you're like, hey, I'm Jack, and I'm doing our Wallocks.
433
What happens?
434
Yeah, basically, I went out to pitching the idea of building a new foreign exchange and money movement network.
435
A lot of people think I'm crazy.
436
And one of the VCs actually believed in it and actually wanted to write a check and lead around.
437
But I think one of the founders of the VC, that is Matrix Partners, and they give the term sheet they signed and they took it back.
438
Yeah, so they basically said, I had a call with the founder after the sign of the term sheet and they were like, oh, I don't think this algorithm thing is going to work.
439
And that's not a defensibility anyway.
440
And yeah, so they basically took it back.
441
What deal did they have on the table?
442
That was $10 million post, so $2 million, $8 million pre.
443
And I literally rejected all the other VCs already.
444
And they end up putting a million dollar and plus other smaller VCs that are putting the $2 million together.
445
That is a billion-dollar pullback.
446
Yes.
447
I mean, they should have closed the deal as they signed.
448
Term sheet.
449
They signed the term sheet?
450
Yeah, they signed.
451
Wow.
452
Yeah, that's appalling.
453
That's bad, bad.
454
Yeah.
455
Okay.
456
And so we have.
457
And this is like one of the most famous VCs in Asia.
458
And the other Australian VCs said no.
459
Yeah, they didn't even want to meet me.
460
They didn't want to meet you?
461
No.
462
So I didn't even get a meeting.
463
I just got an email.
464
So funny, both VCs that rejected me now is on Air Wallet's cap table.
465
No way.
466
Yes, they invested in a $6.2 billion valuation.
467
A SquarePack and...
468
No, so SquarePack invested in Series A.
469
Okay.
470
Essentially, that's, you know, saved us from dying.
471
So there's like three times that we almost died.
472
And that's the second time that we almost run out of money.
473
SquarePack invested, but Blackbird and Airtree was the two largest VCs in Australia together with SquarePack, the three biggest VCs.
474
Yeah, but Airtree and Blackbird rejected us multiple times and they now joined, they wrote the largest check at $6.2 billion ever in our history.
475
Whoa.
476
So fun fact, John Henderson, who's at Airtree, was the first person to ever believe in me.
477
He introduced me to one of my business partners.
478
He's introduced me to my best friends.
479
So John, I don't think you were probably at Airtree at that point, but.
480
I think he was.
481
Well, then you fucked up.
482
No, but I think we had like a, you know, I love John and we had a great conversation, but you know, I guess for whatever reason, I didn't invest.
483
I don't get it.
484
I'm just going to be totally honest.
485
I have a VC now on the side, right?
486
I have a VC called Capital 49, and I wouldn't invest in myself.
487
I think that's crap.
488
I was talking about then you're a bad investor.
489
Because if I had spent any time with you, I would have asked you about growing up and your first jobs in a lemon factory and being a restaurant waiter.
490
Nobody ever asked me.
491
That was ridiculous.
492
Why did no one ever ask you?
493
Because if I heard that.
494
You know who asked that?
495
Yeah.
496
At Siri C, Yuri Miller from DSC asked me.
497
That's why Yuri is Yuri.
498
But dude, your product doesn't matter.
499
That's crazy.
500
So that's another crazy story.
501
Basically, I basically first time with Yuri and we talked to, like, I talked to the partner about the business, obviously, because that's Siri C.
502
And that's straight after I reject the Stripe acquisition offer.
503
And Yuri basically didn't ask me anything about my personal, about my business.
504
He just asked me a bunch of stuff how I grew up.
505
And after that, they were like, we're going to invest at $1.1 billion, $100 million.
506
So I was like, literally, like, within two hours, we grade the term.
507
It's crazy.
508
But this is what I find astonishing, which is like, again, dude, I really don't care what your business is.
509
No offense.
510
You are the person who's going to drive it.
511
You will be for the next 20 years.
512
I can tell whether I'm going to invest in you from hearing about how you think about working in the lemon factory and being on your own in Australia at 16 with no financial security.
513
Dude, there are so few people who can go through that unwavering, hard shit times and get through it.
514
Yeah, but like you wouldn't volunteer to pitch your story that before people ask you.
515
You know what I mean?
516
That's where like the onus is on the question asker.
517
I don't think there's ever such thing as a bad, you doing a bad interview.
518
No one ever gives me a bad interview.
519
I give them a bad interview, which is me not asking the right questions.
520
Same for BC.
521
Yuri is an astonishing man himself.
522
How was that meeting?
523
At that time, you know, I think I was, you know, Sequoia and sort of Tencent and MasterCard led my Series A.
524
And Series C, we got like, because we are, we just, you know, rejected like acquisition offer from Stripe for close to $1.2 billion.
525
And that was a big thing.
526
And we got a term sheet from like Hugh House from Goldman, wanted to lead a billion-dollar round.
527
And the term was not the best.
528
And Neil Shen from Sequoia, China, at the time, and basically don't want me to take the deal because he's the one that recommended me not to take the Stripe deal.
529
He still said, you know, you should just make the right decision for yourself and for the company.
530
And Neil Shen introduced me to two companies.
531
He introduced me to John Lingfo from DST and he introduced me to Scott from Tiger.
532
You know, I had a chat with both and DSC ended up leading the round.
533
How was the meeting with Yuri?
534
Was it a cool meeting?
535
You mentioned him asking.
536
I mean, it's a weird meeting.
537
I mean, imagine you are Series D, you raise above a billion dollar and all you really care about is how you grow up.
538
It's kind of weird, right?
539
And they give you literally a verbal term sheet on the spot.
540
It's also kind of weird.
541
Again, I don't know if it is.
542
When you think about like the billion, I've never.
543
The true generational defining companies are founder-led.
544
You know, we have Bailey Gifford on the show, and of their top 10 positions, nine of the best companies in terms of performance are founder-led.
545
If that is the case, 90% of the best performers are founder-led, and we're only here.
546
Jack, the other thing that you both know, we both know now as investors, a billion dollars does not cover.
547
$10 billion is what we need for.
548
I care about you.
549
I'm not sure.
550
Yeah, I mean, I just thought it's crazy people willing to bet on people at that point at billion-dollar valuation.
551
I do just want to go back and take it chronologically because it's such a cool story.
552
Okay, so the matrix term sheet was pulled, and we get some other VCs in.
553
Cool.
554
What happens then?
555
Like, when does the first product go out?
556
When do we get products?
557
So, the money we raised from the first $3 million from Lucy, the other VC, is really kind of drawing up that when we try to build this peer-to-peer algorithm, which is never going to work.
558
And we kind of know that, and then we were like, oh, we need like basically doing the hard way.
559
We really need to plug our FX engine to an interbank liquidity, you know, whether the Goldman or GP or like, obviously, Goldman and GP are not going to take my course.
560
And we kind of need to build a getting licenses everywhere around the world, you know, connect to the local clearing infrastructure one by one.
561
You know, it's going to be like a hard, but that seems the only way we can do it.
562
And we basically pivoted at that point.
563
That is, I co-called Macquarie.
564
8 a.m.
565
I remember, then I co-called a guy who took like an overnight shift in Macquarie to cover the markets because FX is 24 by 7, 24 by 5.5 markets, right?
566
Tom took the call from Macquarie.
567
He's like a junior guy, can only work on like a night shift at a time.
568
And he was about to finish work at 8, and he took my call.
569
And somehow, I mean, I pitched him, he got him exoted.
570
And he's willing to invest a whole team of engineers from Macquarie Bank to connect me to the interbank market so that I'm able to get two basis points of liquidity from a cost point of view.
571
And, you know, for the first couple of years, our FX price was literally trading back to back to Macquarie.
572
Because normally for the interbank liquidity, you can't trade sub-half a million or million bucks, right?
573
So that that's how you kind of trade on the interbank.
574
And I able to convince Macquarie to build me a product that you can even trade $20 at a, you know, two basis point cost price.
575
Wow.
576
That co-coal worked.
577
I remember, even like after Series A, when we raised $13 million from Sequoia and Tencent and stuff and MasterCard, I went to pitch to Barclays as a friend I used to work together.
578
I met him in Hong Kong and I sit in one side of the boardroom, which is like a five-meter-long table.
579
He wants to sit on the other side of the boardroom.
580
And I was like, dude, what is happening?
581
And I made a pitch.
582
He's like, oh, you know, come to talk to me when you have like a billion volume.
583
That's helpful.
584
Yeah, that's helpful.
585
I'm like, dude, like, oh, now, you know, Barclays is a great partner, but we only start working together when I have like $10 billion volume or something.
586
And Tom, the guy who took Mark's co-collection now is the head of distribution in Macquarie.
587
A phenomenal pick from him.
588
Okay, and so we have that.
589
Do we have product market fit pretty much straight away post-SAT?
590
No.
591
And I got the FX engine built out, and I need like a bunch of payment rails.
592
So I connect to a bunch of aggregators initially because I need the coverage.
593
And then I even connect to Currency Cloud, who ultimately become a competitor later.
594
Essentially, I connect to a bunch of competitors ultimately to get me the coverage of the network.
595
And I have the product going, but in terms of the customer we want to target to, initially targeting SMEs in Australia.
596
We just never really figured out what the product is.
597
We built an invoicing product to allow SME to sell around the world, to get paid through a payment link, and then by kind of integrating with a bunch of payment service providers.
598
And we just never really get a product market fit on that product.
599
It's because the acquisition is too high of SMBs, and we never really got a product market fit.
600
At that point, we kind of know we need to raise more money, otherwise, we're going to be dead.
601
So we basically went to raise money from Sequoia and Tencent.
602
With the product, we know it's going to fail.
603
What happens?
604
So basically, I have a product that's working.
605
I know it's not going to have a product market fit, but I need more money to figure out what the product market fit is.
606
And I basically went to pitch for Sequoia and Tencent.
607
And then one of the ideas is actually to pivot the product to an API product to servicing Tencent to kind of power VeChat Pay Global Settlement.
608
You know, when Chinese tourists come to London Airport, they will pay using VCHAT, and somebody will settle the merchants doing the FX on the back of that.
609
And we were thinking we can do a lot better over the Swift network, and we can do a lot better than the Tencent Treasury Department.
610
And the idea is to maybe that's the opportunity to pivot and leveraging Tencent's volume to grow the business.
611
And then knowing that the SME product is probably going to fail because we haven't only got like 100 customers by that time.
612
And we were raising that $6 million valuation with no revenue.
613
But how does that work?
614
You know that this isn't working.
615
You know that it's not going to work and you're going to have to figure it out.
616
And so you go to Sequoia and you pitch what?
617
Ideas?
618
Oh, I pitched a vision.
619
I pitched the vision of building the largest payment network in the world, alternative to Swift.
620
And that fundamental infrastructure is going to be so important.
621
And that's going to take years to build.
622
That's why we don't have any revenue.
623
How did it go?
624
How did the meetings go?
625
And obviously, I pitched Tencent at the same time, and I told Sequoia, Tencent, I want to lead around, and kind of play the, you know, the kind of competition game.
626
And Sequoia will be like, yeah, if Tencent's like co-leading around, we're in.
627
But then like Tencent did all the I see and everything pass I see.
628
At one point, I was super happy this is going to be done.
629
And the founder of Tencent said, you know, just go through like a normal corporate approval process and the founder of Tencent didn't approve.
630
After three months process, ICO passed, you know, he just basically is like, because the idea is that this is going to help Tencent to do global, you know, VIP settlement.
631
And then Pony, the founder was like, why can't we build ourselves internally?
632
I mean, like, why like a 10-people startup can do a better job than us, you know?
633
Like, we have, you know, hundreds of thousands of engineers.
634
And then the investment team didn't know what to say.
635
So what happened?
636
So basically that was just stalled.
637
The deal was stalled and Sequoia was not willing to invest until Tencent kind of make a decision.
638
And I'm basically running out of money.
639
And the Tencent investment team was just super helpful.
640
They were like, you have one opportunity to pitch to either the president, Martin Lau, or James Mutual, the chief strategy officer.
641
These are the two people who can convince the founder of Tencent to invest, to kind of basically approve the deal.
642
And I basically waited for almost three months to able to have a time slot to meet with James and Martin.
643
How did that go?
644
And I remember, like, I basically met with James Mitchell in Hong Kong in the 5th of January 2017.
645
And I told my team, you know, this would be the most important meeting of my life.
646
And I test the product, everything, until like 3 a.m.
647
and I kind of told my CTO nothing can go wrong during the meeting.
648
I went to a pitch, and it's so funny that James actually was at Goldman before, and he did the RPU of PayPal.
649
And he remember, a majority of the revenue of PayPal actually coming from cross-border payments.
650
And, you know, he kind of didn't really need me to convince him that much.
651
And he kind of sort of convinced me this is like a large enough market and this is a good guy to kind of chasing the opportunity.
652
And he's like, oh, why don't I just take a look at your product?
653
I'm like, yeah, let's do that.
654
And I'm demoing the invoicing product, which I know is going to fail.
655
Not going to have product market fail, but it's a working product, right?
656
It's a prototype leveraging the same, the infrastructure is the same.
657
And I got a 4-0-4 on the spot when I clicked the pay button.
658
And my face just went like blue.
659
And I dodged it.
660
I was like, maybe the link was blocked by the 10cent firewall.
661
And maybe it is, maybe it's not.
662
I mean, we never actually found it out because at that time, the PSP we are using under the hood also had some bugs.
663
You know, we didn't know if the error was caused by the on the PSP was all caused by really the 10 cent firewall.
664
We never, we never know.
665
And he loved it.
666
What happened with that?
667
He just like, oh, you know, it doesn't matter.
668
And then he actually went ahead and I thought it's like a gone, the deal.
669
But he actually went to convince Pony to invest.
670
So we got the investment the day after that.
671
Wow.
672
And then obviously, you know, Sekoya and then MasterCard also came in with Tencent.
673
Do you mind?
674
I like investors who are conviction driven.
675
I don't give a shit who's investing with me.
676
I'm investing because I love Jack.
677
Well, I mean, this is Series A, right?
678
This is not a seed round.
679
This is Series A.
680
Normally, people will have product market fit and have zero revenue.
681
So the idea was that Tencent is going to give me revenue.
682
And MasterCard was also in the round, and MasterCard is supposed to give me revenue as well.
683
So Sequoia's like revenue conviction are based on two of the other investors, which is Tencent and MasterCard, supposed to be the two biggest, largest customers for us.
684
Was that the first near-death experience that you mentioned earlier?
685
I would say the second one, because the first one was, you know, the VC that kind of supposed to invest together with Lucy, they didn't wire the money until like five months later after they signed the term sheet.
686
So they were basically like, show me the demo, show me the demo before they wired the money.
687
I mean, this is like 2015, so the market is a bit...
688
I think it would be a bad thing for any VC to do that today.
689
It is, but it's not that long ago.
690
29 years ago.
691
I agree with you totally, but it's not 20 years ago.
692
I bought out that investor in this round, by the way.
693
I'm very happy about it.
694
Yeah, I know that investor.
695
That's a good one to buy out.
696
So yes, completely.
697
Okay, so we raised this money.
698
We've got Tencent, we've got Mascara, we've got Square.
699
This is the dream cap table now.
700
Does it just go off to the races then?
701
Is it like rocket ship from there?
702
No.
703
Like I said, I mean, we're supposed to have MasterCard and Tencent as a customer.
704
The Tencent deal took me three years after that point.
705
Just a big corporate, right?
706
It's just take a long time.
707
The same thing from the VChat Pay department.
708
They were like, why can't we build ourselves?
709
So they end up building, like, essentially.
710
So that was really not the product we want to sell to them.
711
And we just become like one of the vendors they have, together with GP Morgan and other liquidity providers.
712
And MasterCard is supposed to give us a billion-dollar volume from the MasterCard Sen product, but we got less than a million dollars.
713
And it's just so much high-risk transaction at the time, we had to literally off-board that part of the business.
714
So when does it start to go really well, Jack?
715
Essentially, this is like the third year I'm starting the company.
716
Like 2015 started, like, I started a bit late, like December 2015.
717
So 2016, the peer-to-peer algorithm failed.
718
The invoice also failed in 2017.
719
And in 2017, I raised the money from my Series A and started pivoting the product to an API-driven product to sell to large enterprises for kind of global money movement.
720
And then Tencent and MarsCross are supposed to be the customer.
721
And we built a product for a whole year.
722
We end up not getting any customers.
723
And we're running out of money again.
724
Because we were very aggressive hiring.
725
And so by the end of 2017, we're also running out of money.
726
That's where SquarePack came in.
727
So I started the business.
728
One of the inspirations is because of the founder of SquarePack.
729
And he also, one of the most famous entrepreneurs in Australia.
730
He started one of the biggest tech companies in Australia called Sikh.com.eu, which is like the largest job marketplace in the world at one point.
731
He was the idol of any entrepreneur in Australia, right?
732
So I basically admired him for a long time.
733
And Paul reached out, said, you know, we'd like to have a conversation.
734
And, you know, we really kind of had a great conversation.
735
He liked the vision and mission of the company.
736
And he ended up leading a Series A extension, another.
737
And that was on the vision, too?
738
To build an alternative to Swift, the largest global payment.
739
Third iteration.
740
Yes.
741
I mean, to be fair, that is amazing.
742
I mean, like, again, suspending disbelief.
743
You're looking back now at a track record of fuck, the first didn't work, the second didn't work, the third didn't work.
744
So what happens then?
745
We raise the 6 million more.
746
Yeah, and that we able to sell to other businesses other than Ten Center MasterCard, like a lot of tech companies basically.
747
And that we got like a few companies that are sending tuition payment around the world.
748
And they are massive, right?
749
So we went from zero to a billion-dollar transaction volume within like nine months.
750
Whoa.
751
Whoa, whoa, pause.
752
What?
753
2017?
754
This is 20, this is January 2018.
755
We onboarded that customer.
756
And January 2018, we also onboarded Xi'an.
757
So, you know, I wish I had invested Xi'an at a time.
758
They were like a Series B company.
759
And I just really just have these two massive customers that I'm riding on top of them, Go Global.
760
Wow.
761
Okay, so you had these two mega unicorns just ripping and they are driving your zero to a billion.
762
Yeah, I remember like one day, Xi'an basically needs to pay suppliers in China and they give us $20 million.
763
And our partner in China was the supplier for Xi'an.
764
And he's basically saying that volume got lost between two of their customers, right?
765
So from Xi'an using them directly to using us and we're still using them under the hood, right?
766
But obviously we do the FX and they just do the last mile payment because they have the license in China.
767
We didn't.
768
They were like, no, we're not going to do it.
769
We're literally going to turn your wheels off and we're going to keep Xi'an.
770
And so I basically have 48 hours.
771
And otherwise, I'm going to fuck up my biggest customer or the only customer at the time.
772
So, you called up a new partner and you wanted to?
773
I called our new partner, I was like, let's fix out the legal contract later.
774
Let's go live on Sunday night.
775
So, we basically started integration on Friday night, worked 48 hours straight, went live on Sunday night.
776
Jack, this whole conversation has been a continuation of literally me getting goosebumps at you having these like 48 hours to save a Xi'an contract, which is a lifeblood of the business at that point.
777
Yeah.
778
Who is kind of 90% of the business at the time?
779
Okay.
780
And so we do the zero to a billion, and now we're like, we have a real, real business, correct?
781
Yeah, this is like by the end of 2018, we have a real business.
782
We have not a lot, we have probably like a hundred customers, but all kind of pretty big customers.
783
And so then we go out and raise more money?
784
No, before that, literally, I started taking off in January by April.
785
And then Tencent and Master Carl, Tencent and Socola said, we're going to lead another round.
786
So they basically lead at a $400 million pre, they invest $80 million, so a $480 million post.
787
So they basically, but at that time, the business have no revenue still, like very little revenue.
788
But the volume is like doubling, tripling every month.
789
And we had like all the big investors backing us, right?
790
And we got a Series B at a ridiculous valuation, again, from the same investor, but we added a bunch of other investors.
791
Imagine you're from like a near death in sort of January 2018 to like then in October 2018, Struck reached out to buy us.
792
Stripe reached out to buy you.
793
How does that work?
794
Does John and Patrick send you a DM on Twitter?
795
What does that look like?
796
Will Gabriel, the CFO at the time, I think now he's CP.
797
And obviously, like, I'm like a huge admirer of Stripe, right?
798
So every FinTech out there will be like, you know, Stripe is the golden standard of developer-friendly APIs and documentation.
799
And I'm a huge fan of what Stripe and John have built.
800
And I was like, oh, if I ever get a chance to talk to Stripe, yeah, I'm all in to learn, right?
801
The conversation with Will went really well.
802
And then all of a sudden, that Patrick reached out, wanted to catch up.
803
At the time, we were literally setting up a developer hub in Shanghai.
804
He said he would fly to Shanghai to see me.
805
Yeah, so he went, fly to Shanghai to literally see me and my co-founder.
806
And we spent a whole day together.
807
He flew to Shanghai.
808
Yeah, he flew to Shanghai.
809
Probably the first time he went to Shanghai or second time.
810
I don't remember.
811
How was the day together?
812
We went through the product in the morning and we just talked the whole vision about the company and the future.
813
At that time, we were kind of thinking about going to build merchant acquiring, essentially competing with Stripe.
814
Because, you know, Stripe was not really an APAC at the time.
815
And we already built the payout rails and FX.
816
And the pay-in is just a natural evolution of connecting the end-to-end part of the platform.
817
Because all our customers that are paying out to contractors, developers, suppliers, tuitions around the world that need pay-in, right?
818
They need process online payment and offline payments.
819
And we kind of have to do that.
820
And then Patrick basically said, oh, we're going to build payout because we have all these pay-ins around the world and we need to do payout and we haven't built anything.
821
Kind of makes sense.
822
We either sort of work together or maybe we should buy you guys.
823
And I was like, kind of weird.
824
You have the best FinTech.
825
I mean, obviously, we started for more than three and a half years at a time, but the real product market fit only been like 10 months.
826
You know, like you really started even getting product market fit.
827
So what happens then?
828
They said, well, we should work together or we should buy you.
829
What do you say?
830
He said, you know, let's just spend more time together.
831
So he started this whole documentation on Google Sheet and just 10, 20 pages long and asked me to make comments.
832
So like I make comments and we just worked out.
833
It's like, wow, the vision of the company in the next decade is kind of very much the same.
834
We all wanted to build AWS or financial services.
835
And obviously Stripe is much, much ahead of us.
836
But this is before COVID.
837
I mean, Strive is like a $9 billion company.
838
It's very similar to the scale of Airwallets today.
839
And I kind of really liked Patrick and it's like, this guy is so smart.
840
He's like much smarter than me.
841
Can I ask you what makes him so smart?
842
The Collisons are always hailed as like, you know, partner geniuses.
843
What do you think makes him so smart from ideating with him, from working with him on a Google Doc?
844
I mean, it's not that the Google Doc that make me think that he's smart.
845
He's just like so intellectually honest about everything.
846
And also, he's like able to go deep in multiple dimensions.
847
He reads about China history.
848
You know, he knows China history more than me.
849
And he knows about quantum physics.
850
He knows, you know, biology.
851
You know, all this field that I have never gone into.
852
And he's able to talk about it for hours.
853
And I'm just like, how can one person able to go deep in multiple dimensions?
854
You know, if you talk about fintech, I think I'm as good as these guys, right?
855
But if you're just talking about like biology or quantum physics or China history, I mean, like, I'm a Chinese, I feel ashamed that he knows more China history than me.
856
And, you know, you know.
857
How do they table a $1.2 billion offer?
858
So essentially, it's a complicated deal construct.
859
Essentially, it's $800 million on the cap table and $350 million to me and my co-founders.
860
And I think it's a $50 million, I think, $25 million to the core employees, close to $1.2, $1.11, $175 or something.
861
What happens then?
862
You sit down with your co-founders.
863
How does that conversation go?
864
And he invited us to San Francisco and we had a great conversation.
865
I kind of at that time, I'm kind of almost convinced.
866
And he sent his whole team to Melbourne.
867
They did like a whole week of due diligence with like all the senior people from Stripe.
868
I met with Claire, the CEO at the time, and I met with the whole team.
869
I was really impressed.
870
And I kind of basically said, I think we're going to do it.
871
But I was, you know, like, it's just kind of, you know, are you really going to do it on the back of your mind?
872
And I fly back to Melbourne and I was working in San Francisco for two weeks and tried to figure it out.
873
I couldn't figure it out.
874
I mean, I was like 70%.
875
I wanted to do it, but like this voice in my head is like, are you going to do it?
876
Are you going to do it?
877
I ultimately be like, okay, so if I sold the business, I was 34 at a time, 33 at a time.
878
And this is going to five-year lockup, right?
879
So I'll be close to 40 when I finish the lockup.
880
And we're going to do like a 38, 39-year-old.
881
Can I be blunt?
882
How much money would you have made from the deal?
883
If I know Stripe is going to get to 100 billion, I mean, I probably made like at least $3 billion.
884
You know, at that time, you know, Stripe was going to raise the $20 billion round.
885
We know that we probably can raise another round and at a billion.
886
It wasn't really an evaluation.
887
I didn't live in a very luxury lifestyle, right?
888
So I didn't need any money.
889
That's not even like high-end shops, right?
890
Billionaires and anyone that goes to go to the same supermarket.
891
So it's a very sort of socialized society.
892
And, you know, I think with like 200 grand, you can live a pretty good life.
893
And I didn't know what to do with the money anyway.
894
And that's not what I actually thought about at the time.
895
And I really thought about is what's going to make me happy.
896
And I went back to Melbourne, asked my co-bunders, like, let's just vote, right?
897
Because I really can't figure it out.
898
You know, Lucy is like, I don't really care because my family is, you know, is wealthy and I don't need more money.
899
I really enjoy it.
900
I think we should keep building.
901
My CTO, Jacob, is like, no, it's really up to you, Jack.
902
I mean, this is your mission, your vision.
903
And we're all here to help you.
904
And then ultimately, it's your goal.
905
And Max is like, you know, I think I'm okay to sell.
906
I mean, like, that's a lot of money.
907
Good old, Max.
908
And then we were like, we couldn't decide it.
909
And we asked our senior leadership team to vote.
910
Surprisingly, only one people wanted to sell.
911
Like, literally, like, 90% of people said, you know, they think we can build a bigger business.
912
So you fired that one person.
913
Well, that person joined Stripe, even worse.
914
No.
915
Yes.
916
That's the whole story.
917
Yeah.
918
I mean, we all kind of tried to hire her afterwards.
919
And I kind of sued her.
920
And he sued me.
921
She sued me.
922
That was a whole complicated story.
923
That vote was a very telling sign, wasn't it?
924
I mean, I don't think she's that great anyway.
925
So it's kind of fine.
926
But just she has so much proprietary knowledge of our network.
927
And we were worried about she's going to give away to Stripe.
928
That's a long story.
929
Yeah.
930
I was like, I don't think I want to be doing another startup when I'm 38.
931
I think I'm gonna give it a shot on this one and put all my life into it.
932
And that's it.
933
So, one thing that really inspired me from talking and spending time with Patrick is that I said, Oh, you know, like, what's a long-term thing for Stripe or for yourself?
934
Are you gonna be here forever or blah blah blah?
935
And then, Patrick just like said to me that he's gonna build Stripe for the next 20, 30, 40 years.
936
And I just never heard like a founder like told me that people would dedicate their entire life to building a business.
937
That was so inspiring to me.
938
That's what I want to do.
939
You know, it'll build a real economic infrastructure that changed the world, impacting millions of businesses growing on the internet or growing globally.
940
So, we turned that down, and we're now back to business, baby.
941
We need to scale volume.
942
We have Shein and we have this other large provider.
943
Is it now like just all hands to the pump?
944
Scale, scale, scale.
945
Yeah, and we got the money from DST, so got another $100 million and a bunch of other investors.
946
When you raise $100 million and you suddenly have like quite a lot of money, is it difficult in terms of constraints that are now removed and just?
947
And I didn't understand what that means at the time.
948
I don't know what is financial discipline, so I don't have a budget.
949
I'm just like hire as fast as possible, blow it all up.
950
And then I realized at one point that we're running out of money.
951
Like, I was like, Yeah, you didn't have a budget, yeah.
952
And we are, we went from like, I think like 100-something people to like 600-700 people like in a year.
953
And uh, and then I realized that our volume growth.
954
And we also, the vision kind of started evolving after seriously.
955
After rejecting Stripe offer, I'm like, okay, we're going to compete long term.
956
And, you know, I mean, obviously, Stripe is a payment-led business.
957
We are a banking-led business.
958
But at that time, we're not a banking business yet, right?
959
We're just like a global money movement infrastructure.
960
We were like, okay, we need to become a true global new bank.
961
And then we need to build our card issuing infrastructure so we can issue corporate card.
962
We need to build merchant acquiring infrastructure so we can handle the payment side of the money flow as well.
963
So we basically need to evolve from a single product company to a multi-product company, an end-to-end platform with infrastructure and software to supporting global businesses.
964
I basically put most of the money out of the 100 million to build this new product and not investing in the existing product.
965
And that is the biggest bet I made.
966
Essentially, you investing like more than half the money you raise onto the product that you're not going to have any revenue for the next three or four years.
967
Did that not strike you as alarming at the time?
968
I kind of realized once we sort of reject the Stripe offer and ultimately we're going to compete, it kind of scares me that if I don't invest fast enough, ultimately, you know, we just don't have a role to play.
969
So it was the right thing to make those investments.
970
Well, we kind of did two things.
971
We went all the way into international expansion.
972
So we started opening offices in the UK, in the US, and like everywhere.
973
And that kind of to be a disaster because we kind of didn't have product market fit in any of these places.
974
And then that international expansion basically just failed.
975
And that was because of product market fit?
976
Yeah, we're not hiring fast enough.
977
We're not building product enough.
978
We don't have a real product in the UK, but we hired a bunch of teams here.
979
How long did you?
980
Pretty quick.
981
I mean, you just don't have any revenue because nobody's going to buy your product.
982
So six months later, you're like, uh-uh, cut.
983
Yeah, I didn't cut.
984
I basically keep going.
985
And because we had an infrastructure here, we needed people to manage in the infrastructure and we keep trying.
986
And a lot of the people I hired are my friends.
987
So you just persisted through to product market fit in these geographies?
988
Yeah, it took me three years to get PMF in the UK.
989
Wow, that's a lot of money.
990
Well, I mean, it's a small team.
991
And then we also train a lot of people.
992
So that was the mistake I made.
993
When you say that was a mistake you made, what was that mistake?
994
Just bad hiring?
995
We also didn't have the product.
996
I think we just hired too early.
997
And also, we don't really know what sort of people to hire.
998
It's kind of a combination of both.
999
What do you mean you don't know what sort of people to hire?
1000
I'm a product engineer.
1001
I really know no idea how to build a commercial organization.
1002
And all we did is selling to large enterprises, right?
1003
But we have a lot of VC network in APAC.
1004
And when I come to the UK, I don't have the VC network.
1005
I don't really know how to sell to large enterprises.
1006
I don't have any VC network here.
1007
I know what opened the door for me.
1008
And we just couldn't really sell the product.
1009
That the vision really evolved from a single product company to a multi-product company.
1010
But that evolved, it took three and a half years to get the initial product market fit.
1011
Just during that three and a half years, we are too aggressive in international expansion while we don't have a good product.
1012
And so we need more money.
1013
Yes.
1014
And at this point, our last round was the 1.1 with DST.
1015
Yeah.
1016
Wow.
1017
And we're running out of money again.
1018
Are you nervous when you're running out of money?
1019
Yeah.
1020
And I'm at SoftBank.
1021
And I was like, okay, so SoftBank was the goal TNVC.
1022
This is 2019.
1023
Okay.
1024
And I fly all the way to London.
1025
And they stopped investing and they did all the work, but the partner going to invest in us got fired.
1026
And I literally, in a situation, we're going to kind of die again by not able to raise money.
1027
What happens then?
1028
Basically, I was able to convince the existing investor to give me a lifeline of convertible notes.
1029
So DSC and Tencent led the convertible notes.
1030
Wow.
1031
So we raised essentially, I think, $70 to $100 million, like kind of a convertible.
1032
But the idea is that we're able to raise another round straight after that.
1033
And I need to find an alternative to SoftBank.
1034
And Halo Sofia is the answer.
1035
So Ian from Halo that led our Series D to kind of get us going.
1036
But the funny thing is that COVID happened in 2020.
1037
When we signed in the SPA, because we have a business in China, we know that the virus is taking off.
1038
And this is like February 2020.
1039
And we were literally going through this due diligence stuff.
1040
And everyone's sort of, the investor started asking me, what is this COVID thing?
1041
I didn't know how to answer the question because I was like, this is going to be really, really bad.
1042
And I can't say that.
1043
And I knew it's really, really bad because I have employees in China.
1044
And right there's like a shutdown on the whole city and all this crazy stuff.
1045
I even wrote a text message to the Prime Minister of Australia to shut the border from China.
1046
I remember that the week that the day we actually, the week we actually closing the series D, the U.S.
1047
stock market tanked more than 10% three times.
1048
This is the first time ever happened in the U.S.
1049
history.
1050
So the market went down 30%.
1051
I called Neil Shen and I was like, do you think Ian is going to close?
1052
And would you close if you are in this situation?
1053
And Neil told me he's really not sure.
1054
To the credit of Ian, I mean, Ian closed.
1055
What was that round?
1056
That was, I think, 1.7.
1057
This is like the round after the convertible.
1058
So the older people that invest in a convertible get converted to the $1.7 billion round.
1059
$1.7 billion.
1060
How big was the check?
1061
I think it was $150.
1062
Obviously, like half that's really existing, and Ian put in like $75 or $80 billion.
1063
How is Ian?
1064
He's very behind the scenes.
1065
He's very discreet.
1066
He is.
1067
I mean, Helisophia is a very secretive firm, and we weren't allowed to put a PR using the Hidosophia name.
1068
So you would see a bunch of investors led a Series D, but Hido Sofia was not named.
1069
I think they changed the policy now.
1070
Yeah, they have done.
1071
They're much more public.
1072
Yeah, and they're a little bit more public now.
1073
But yeah, I think Ian Sidomobo is one of our largest investors, and not many people know about it.
1074
Has he been a great board member?
1075
Yeah.
1076
I mean, he's been investing in the company from 2019 for like five, six rounds after that.
1077
He just keeps doubling down.
1078
So I think we probably won the largest investment of Hitosophia in terms of dollar amount.
1079
So you close that, we get going again.
1080
Yes.
1081
We keep plowing away at these international markets.
1082
We are fucking relentless, bashing product market fit in, and we fix it.
1083
It starts looking really good.
1084
When does the business really start humming?
1085
I mean, 2020, obviously, during COVID, our revenue went half.
1086
That's why I wasn't sure whether it's going to cost.
1087
Because like half our revenue is from tuition and travel, right?
1088
And all this tuition.
1089
What's your revenue at that point?
1090
Scrub acquisition at that time, we were only $2 million in 2018.
1091
So we went $10 million in 2019, so we five times the revenue in 2019.
1092
21 that we went more than doubled again.
1093
Wow, in COVID.
1094
2020, we doubled, right?
1095
So that's where COVID, and 2021, we more than doubled, we kind of 2.5x.
1096
Fuck.
1097
2 million in revenue when Stripe did the 1.2 billion.
1098
Yeah.
1099
And then crazy, I said, no.
1100
No, no, no.
1101
Now you look like a genius, but you know, if I was a VC on your board, then I would be supportive if you wanted to sell.
1102
Well, I mean, from a Sequoia point of view, that they invested $480 only for three months.
1103
And, you know, they made just under double the money because they're 800 million on the cap table, right?
1104
Dude, I totally get it.
1105
It does not do much for them in that respect.
1106
And their fund size, totally.
1107
Okay, so we closed the head of Safir, we're off to the races.
1108
What happens now?
1109
Then COVID happened, right?
1110
So that we lost half our revenue and we were really figuring out what to do.
1111
At that time, we started getting product market fit on the SMB banking product.
1112
You know, we built the infrastructure, we started to issuing corporate cards, we started getting the merchant acquiring thing kind of builded out.
1113
But ultimately, launching 2021, the foundation of a global bank started to evolve.
1114
That was the first three, four years of just basically building the best money-moving infrastructure in the world to build the next generation of a global bank, right?
1115
Build the future of a global banking.
1116
And that obviously took a lot of money, a lot of got to bet on this new product that only started generating revenue from 2022.
1117
So from 2019, 2020, 2021, there's no revenue for all this new product.
1118
Only from 2022, they start generating revenue.
1119
Was the ball putting pressure on you?
1120
Because there's a lot of revenue.
1121
Well, the business is still doubling every year from the existing product.
1122
And I just got investor knock on the door every single day, right?
1123
So Grand Oaks led around in January 2021 for $2.6 billion.
1124
And Lumpai led around in June, July at $4 billion.
1125
Dude, I'm not being rude.
1126
Do you have any of the company left?
1127
Like, this is a lot of funding rounds.
1128
Yeah, we raised $400 million in 2021.
1129
Like, the valuation went from 1.7 to 5.5%.
1130
Like, every month, I'm raising money, basically.
1131
Like, then you raise like three rounds.
1132
And end of 2021, Salt Bank was talking to me about leading an $8 billion round.
1133
And obviously, we didn't entertain that conversation.
1134
Do you not worry about the dilution?
1135
At that time, I know the vision is really big.
1136
How much capital required to build a global bank?
1137
It's going to be in the balance.
1138
I just want to raise as much money as I can.
1139
And obviously, I only raised like $100 at a $5.5 million.
1140
I should have raised more at a time.
1141
But I think air wallets will be dead without 2021.
1142
We raised $400 million.
1143
We really well capitalized.
1144
The business kept doubling.
1145
And we had enough money just to keep going.
1146
And obviously, we raised a flat round in 2022 because at that time we were burning close to $200 million a year.
1147
And we weren't really sure how long we're going to last.
1148
And we went profitable in 23.
1149
And I just realized that we can just keep growing the business.
1150
And then even in 22, 23, we keep doubling the business.
1151
And we keep doubling the business while our headcount is not growing.
1152
So we never did a layoff.
1153
And we were able to continue to grow the business more than 100%.
1154
So we basically never grow below 100% from 2015 to 2023.
1155
Never grew below 100%.
1156
Yeah.
1157
For eight years straight.
1158
Yeah.
1159
Fuck.
1160
And we're still growing 90% year-on-year.
1161
We went to like $500 million AR in August last year, then hit like 600 in November and 700 in sort of January and Feb.
1162
And the business just can still grow insanely fast.
1163
700 in January, Feb.
1164
I'm about to say a bold statement given the volatility that we have within markets.
1165
If I project forward to end-of-year revenues, your end-of-year revenues at this rate is like 900?
1166
More than a billion.
1167
More than a billion.
1168
Why did you do a deal at 9 billion?
1169
9x is a public markets multiple.
1170
Well, we raised around 6.2, like literally went out last week or this week.
1171
That was at 6.2?
1172
Yeah.
1173
Why did you do that deal?
1174
Well, we started the deal end of last year.
1175
And, you know, I'm so sorry to be so blunt, but it's like that's like a 6x revenue multiple.
1176
Well, I mean, people don't really look at Jack.
1177
Jack, I would have done that fucking deal.
1178
I think people don't really look at revenue multiple anymore, right?
1179
People are looking at gross profit.
1180
You know, we're doing $450 million gross profit this year.
1181
So essentially, it's 13 times of this year's gross profit.
1182
I mean, it's not bad.
1183
I mean, if you look at that, that's kind of the same sort of multiple stride or the revolution doing.
1184
Yeah, I'm saying that's a good deal for an investor to do.
1185
And I think people are on, like, these Chinese don't give you too much credit on the growth rate today.
1186
They don't give you too much credit on the growth rate?
1187
No, I don't think so.
1188
I think people really looking at public market calm and, you know, because what happened in 2021, so there's less investors out there believe that you can grow in 90% for a long period of time.
1189
Imagine like in 2021, right?
1190
People got burned.
1191
People all growing 100%.
1192
And this went from growing 100% to like 20% in like months.
1193
I think people just like, investors just got burned.
1194
And, you know, I think that people just give you less credit that you can grow at this highest speed for a long period of time.
1195
How much did you just raise just now?
1196
Raised $300 million.
1197
$300 million.
1198
Are you still on the, hey, I need to be fundraising every month, Train?
1199
No, I'm actually buying back the airwater stock myself.
1200
So I actually in the process of taking a debt of $70 million to buy Airwater secondaries.
1201
Because I just have so much confidence to the company.
1202
No way.
1203
Yes.
1204
You're taking out a $70 million debt.
1205
Yeah, with some of my co-founders.
1206
Yeah, we are literally buying our own stock.
1207
Wow.
1208
You're buying from early.
1209
Yeah, early investors.
1210
Wow.
1211
Do you get that at a discount?
1212
We haven't done that yet.
1213
Let's see.
1214
Can I join?
1215
That was a question.
1216
That's what I was a joke.
1217
Yeah, no, of course.
1218
No, no, dude.
1219
If you haven't realized by now, I do these shows just for the moments like that where I'm like, whoa, that is insane.
1220
That is nuts, dude.
1221
The growth rate of 100% a year for eight years straight.
1222
Camas, did you take secondaries out along the way?
1223
I took some secondaries, not a massive amount of money, but I did.
1224
How do you advise founders on that?
1225
We mentioned 2021.
1226
A lot of founders took them out then.
1227
I think they're wrongly chastised.
1228
I think they're very good in a lot of cases.
1229
If you were to advise me as a founder, hey, Jack, secondaries, what do you think?
1230
I recommend founders take enough secondaries so that they can account for life.
1231
They don't need to worry about how do they feed the family, how do they support the kids, how do they buy a house.
1232
In Melbourne, I think that the living standards is much lower than London.
1233
I think in London, you need like $20, $30 million to leave a very kind of comfortable.
1234
Because you just wanted the founder to be all in building the business rather than thinking about how to support the family, if you know what I mean.
1235
I totally do.
1236
But for any founders, do not take out $20 or $30 million from my round if it's too early.
1237
I think also timing matters.
1238
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1239
I think like for a late-stage founder, like, you know, above a billion-dollar valuation, I think $20-30 million is a decent amount, but it's not like a ridiculous amount that you set for your life or anything.
1240
I think it's just a good tap for a founder to not think about money too much and just really focus on the vision.
1241
Do you love being a CEO?
1242
You mentioned your product, your engineering centrality is who you are.
1243
Do you like being a CEO?
1244
I don't like the everyday of the job of a CEO.
1245
And I like I'm able to control the destiny of the company.
1246
And I ultimately answer to the outcome of the event, like the outcome of the company, the outcome of the customer, the outcome of the employee.
1247
I wanted to have that control so I know that we are heading the right direction towards our vision.
1248
I don't like dealing with the people issues, you know, dealing with the policies, the procedures, and all that type of stuff.
1249
What did you not do in the AirWallets journey that, with the benefit of hindsight, you wish you had done?
1250
A couple of things.
1251
Number one, I hired the first 100 people in AirWallets by myself on LinkedIn.
1252
And obviously, there's a lot of benefit doing that, but I could have hired a good recruiter just to help me to do the outreach and give him the access to my LinkedIn password.
1253
You know what I mean?
1254
I didn't need to do that myself.
1255
Today, I could just get an AI to do that.
1256
Yeah, I think get a good recruiter early on that kind of, you know, make the hiring a lot more efficient.
1257
Number two is that don't over-invest in international expansion when you don't have product market fit, right?
1258
And that could really put a lot of risk to your company.
1259
And we lucky 2021 happened, and we're lucky that Ian closed around in 2020 when our revenue half and COVID happened, and you know, stock down 30%.
1260
But I don't think everyone is going to be that lucky.
1261
So, do that.
1262
And I think the other thing is just really focus on investing in the culture early.
1263
Did you ever have a moment when the culture was broken, and what did you do to fix it?
1264
It's a lot of pain.
1265
The first four or five years, we hired a lot of people with a lot of great experiences.
1266
They're from a bank, they're from a citibank, they have built a Swift network before, you know, they know the thing, and they join, like telling me, like, you guys know nothing, what you're going to do doesn't work, we need to do blah, blah, blah.
1267
And none of those people worked.
1268
None of the people think they know how to build a startup that worked.
1269
And ultimately, it's not about experience, it's about the competency, right?
1270
It's about the curiosity, the determination, about the resilience, and about the belief in the vision, about the passion.
1271
And I think we should just have hired those curious, determined, optimistic people from early on.
1272
But we didn't.
1273
So we had to fire all of them, and that is a tough, tough decision.
1274
And we really slowed down the company.
1275
We had bad press about it.
1276
Just a lot of plan to go through.
1277
Should you always take the highest price on fundraising?
1278
No, I think you should always prioritize what gives you the biggest leverage: the leverage on brand, the leverage on hiring, that leveraging on commercial opportunities.
1279
Do venture firms, brands make a material difference?
1280
Yes.
1281
Only the top five make a difference.
1282
So having Sequoia makes a big difference.
1283
Huge difference.
1284
Why would you not like it?
1285
Ultimately, you wanted to work with the best investor, not only an investor, but also a friend and that people you get along with and you like.
1286
It's not saying I don't like the investor in Sequoia, I'm just saying that you just choose the brand over the people.
1287
Which investor do you not have that you would like to have?
1288
I wish I have someone like Michael Morris that invests in Stripe, like a true visionary investor, supported the founder from day one.
1289
You know, like I think Michael Morris played a very important role of Stripe success, waving the flag of Stripe, early days of Silicon Valley, early days of Stripe in Silicon Valley saying, you know, John Patrick is going to be the next Sergey Brand or Larry Page, you know, that they're going to build a trillion-dollar company, you know, blah, blah, blah.
1290
I don't think I had that support.
1291
Have you met him?
1292
Yeah.
1293
I mean, Michael Morris invited me to his home, tried to convince me to sell the company.
1294
Oh, wow.
1295
I mean, I wish I had an investor do that for me.
1296
You know?
1297
How was that?
1298
It's a beautiful home, and there's a nice conversation.
1299
And it didn't convince you.
1300
Well, I mean, his argument makes a lot of sense that he's saying, you know, like, I said, you know, why don't I just keep building and maybe sell later?
1301
Like, what now?
1302
I haven't really figured it out, you know, what I want to do with my life yet.
1303
It's like, you know, the earlier you can compound, the faster you can build a trillion-dollar business.
1304
I mean, it kind of makes sense.
1305
Listen, I want to do a quick vibe.
1306
I've so enjoyed this.
1307
When I ask you about a founder you deeply admire, other than the Collison's, who comes to mind first?
1308
I really like Elon.
1309
I think what he has done is able to ultimately is pushing the humanity forward.
1310
If you could put all of your money into one company other than Air Wallets, which company would you put all of your money into?
1311
I would put half of my money in Spanish.
1312
I mean, that's my competition ultimately in the future.
1313
I'll put some money in Stripe.
1314
You put some money in Stripe.
1315
Yeah.
1316
What's the hardest thing about your role today?
1317
Make decisions knowing that more than 50% probability is going to be a wrong decision.
1318
You should be a venture investor.
1319
Do you like investing?
1320
I don't think I'm a great investor.
1321
I don't really know how to assess early stage funding wearable.
1322
Why do you think that is?
1323
You know, like before part of market fit is really just based on people's personality.
1324
I don't know how to make an investment decision based on people's personality or the history of people, right?
1325
That's why I said I wouldn't able to invest in myself.
1326
I just haven't seen enough data to build that confidence.
1327
What worries you that you think not enough people are spending time on?
1328
Generally, people are making decisions based on the knowledge they have.
1329
And generally, that is not the right thing to do because the biggest mistake you make is from making a decision based on the knowledge you don't have.
1330
An ultimate one for you.
1331
You're in London now.
1332
Are you impressed by London's tax scene?
1333
What do you make of it?
1334
I think it's better than Melbourne.
1335
I love the global nature of London, and so far I've enjoyed meeting a lot of entrepreneurs.
1336
I think it's going to be an exciting place.
1337
Do you love living out here?
1338
Yeah.
1339
Apart from it, it's very expensive.
1340
You know, everything else is pretty good.
1341
Final one for you, dude.
1342
Air Wallocks in 2035, 10 years out.
1343
Yeah.
1344
Where are you then?
1345
I hope we have built one of the largest global payments and banking platforms to power modern businesses around the world.
1346
I hope we have built a bigger business than Citi or HSBC because you know when we succeed at doing that, millions of businesses around the world will benefit from the success of our mission.
1347
Public?
1348
Public or not?
1349
Doesn't matter.
1350
Would you like to be a public company at some point?
1351
In the Rotability, we kind of all have to think about that.
1352
But right now, we've been really head down building.
1353
Dude, this has been one of the most awesome, fun, fascinating stories.
1354
Thank you so much for sharing it with me.
1355
And I cannot tell you how much I've enjoyed it.
1356
Thanks, Harry.
1357
I really enjoyed it, the conversation.
1358
I think that has to be the greatest angel investment that I've heard of in a long time.
1359
A million to a billion.
1360
Incredible.
1361
Eight years of 100% growth year on year.
1362
What an insane story.
1363
I feel Air Wallets is just this untold gem.
1364
I cannot thank Jack enough for sharing that story.
1365
What an episode.
1366
And you heard my gasps when he revealed some of those elements.
1367
But before we leave you today, I love seeing the team come together to make this show happen.
1368
What I don't love is trying to keep track of all the information, the data, and the projects that we're working on across dozens of platforms, products, and tools.
1369
