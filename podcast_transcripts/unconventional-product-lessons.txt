1
My probably most spectacular failure was I was the first PM on Hangouts.
2
We had thousands of people working for me.
3
We had entire power of Google.
4
We had Larry literally sitting with us saying we can do anything we want Chrome to do.
5
And we still didn't manage to build a great messaging product.
6
The main kind of learnings from that is don't take on projects that are going to be six months, a year, because you just generally don't have control over the macro.
7
The challenge with being a product manager is everybody thinks they can do their job.
8
Anybody who uses the product thinks they have ideas.
9
So at some point in time, you're like, what is my discipline?
10
Like, what is my science?
11
The moment you build experimentation, you now made it scientific.
12
A lot of new people in their career are like, oh, I just want to think about strategy.
13
I'm going to think about the big picture.
14
Strategy is a little bit overrated for product.
15
For most product managers, your strategy should be, how fast can I go from hypothesis to data?
16
Today, my guest is Mayur Komet.
17
Mayur is chief product officer at N26, one of the most successful fintech startups in the world, and which in my research came in amongst the top five companies in the world who are hiring and producing the best product managers.
18
Prior to N26, Mayur was global head of product at Binance, VP of product at Agota, which is over a hundred billion dollar company based in Thailand, and a PM at Google and Microsoft.
19
In our wide-ranging conversation, Mayur shares what he's learned about hiring and developing great product managers, what he learned from his time working at Binance, which as you'll soon hear was one of the wildest and most unique ways of working, what he learned from the failure of Google's early attempts at Hangouts, where he was the first PM.
20
Also, the pros and cons of working in Asia versus Europe versus the US, and why you should be starting your career on the west coast of the US.
21
Also, why comp early in your career does not matter.
22
And so much more.
23
This episode is so full of golden nuggets and advice for product people throughout every stage of their career.

This episode is brought to you by WorkOS.
29
If you're building a SaaS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and skim provisioning.
30
That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app.
31
Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features.
32
Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know, like Vercel, Webflow, and Loom.
33
WorkOS also recently acquired Warrant, the fine-grain authorization service.
34
Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube.
35
This enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases.
36
If you're currently looking to build role-based access control or other enterprise features like single sign-on, skim, or user management, you should consider WorkOS.
37
It's a drop-in replacement for Auth0 and supports up to 1 million monthly active users for free.
38
Check it out at workOS.com to learn more.
39
That's workos.com.

Many of you are building AI products, which is why I'm very excited to chat with Brandon Fu, founder and CEO of Paragon.
41
Hey, Brandon.
42
Hey, Lenny.
43
Thanks for having me.
44
So, integrations have become a big deal for AI products.
45
Why is that?
46
Integrations are mission-critical for AI for two reasons.
47
First, AI products need context from their customers' business data, such as Google Drive files, Slack messages, or CRM records.
48
Second, for AI products to automate work on behalf of users, AI agents need to be able to take action across these different third-party tools.
49
So where does Paragon fit into all this?
50
Well, these integrations are a pain to build, and that's why Paragon provides an embedded platform that enables engineers to ship these product integrations in just days instead of months across every use case from rag data ingestion to agentic actions.
51
And I know from first-hand experience that maintenance is even harder than just building it for the first time.
52
Exactly.
53
We believe product teams should focus engineering efforts and competitive advantages, not integrations.
54
That's why companies like U.com, AI21, and hundreds of others use Paragon to accelerate their integration strategy.
55
If you want to avoid wasting months of engineering on integrations that your customers need, check out Paragon at useparagon.com/slash Lenny.
56
Mayur, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.
57
Thank you.
58
This is super exciting.
59
Thank you for having me.
60
I want to start with your time at Binance.
61
So you've worked at Google, you worked at Microsoft, you worked at a company called Agota.
62
Now you're at N26.
63
I imagine Binance was the most unique place that you've worked at.
64
And I've also never heard much about what it's like to work at a company like Binance.
65
I was just looking them up on Wikipedia.
66
I saw they started in China, they moved to Japan, they moved to Malta, and now they have no official headquarters.
67
What was it just like working at Binance?
68
How was it most unique from other places?
69
Yeah, so maybe just a background for Binance, because I think a lot of people have heard it, some in positive connotation, some not so much.
70
The scale of Binance is pretty mind-boggling.
71
So just to give like the history, they started in 2017 as a crypto exchange when there were other crypto exchanges on the market for years, like Coinbase.
72
And within six months, they became number one.
73
So that's unprecedented.
74
That's like launching a search engine today, and then six months later, beating Google.
75
And then they went within five years to at a peak valuation of somewhere like 400 billion or so with 2,000 employees.
76
So that's zero to 400 billion in five years.
77
So it's at a scale that's never been done before.
78
Like Google couldn't do it, Facebook, none of the names that you hear it.
79
And so it's remarkable.
80
When I was there as the head of product, my KPI, my top-line KPI was the trading volume, and my monthly KPI was in trillions of dollars.
81
So that's just the scale was mind-boggling.
82
We had teams of 10, 20 people running multi-billion dollar profit businesses.
83
And that brings it with it like a first Nick, how did they do that to that scale?
84
And two, what kind of culture requires to keep that running.
85
Both are very fascinating.
86
I think we could spend a lot of time talking about it.
87
But the truly interesting thing, the first one is this: you can't do this by having a traditional log structure.
88
So CZ, the founder and CEO, at one point had like 55 direct reports.
89
And his direct reports had about the similar ones.
90
So for a large portion of the history of the company, there was just one level between the individual employees and the CEO.
91
And that leads to like an extreme level of decision-making and execution.
92
You cannot have one-on-ones when you have 55 direct reports.
93
So, there's a culture of one-to-many and doing that as often as possible.
94
So, the leadership team, for example, met every day.
95
And because the leadership team was spread across the world, we met at like 11 p.m.
96
when I was in Singapore every day.
97
That includes the weekends, holidays.
98
Like the leadership team was there 11 p.m.
99
every single day, which meant that none of the decisions were blocked for more than 24 hours.
100
And most of them, we made it on chat even within those 24 hours.
101
But if there was something big, it was escalated, decided.
102
We executed largely based on this concept that I now take with me.
103
I call it the running products via daily meeting.
104
So, we would pick an owner for something really urgent at the nightly leadership call.
105
And then that owner would be expected to have like all hands on deck for however long that problem is every single day, and then report the updates on the daily call.
106
And some of these were like really massive topics, like how do we get 15 financial licenses in 15 countries in the next three months?
107
So, it wouldn't be at a scale that was like 24 hours.
108
Yes.
109
And people did it.
110
Like, it's extremely interesting to see that when you have really smart people, you give them really hard problems.
111
You have no constraints on what can you need to solve them, whether it's money, people.
112
People can move mountains in a small amount of time.
113
And that extreme ownership culture.
114
I think probably was the most fascinating part of working at Binance that I've now tried to take.
115
There's some good parts of it in terms of attention to detail, being able to pick certain areas and own it irrespective of what your title is and how many people report to you.
116
There are certain downsides in terms of the amount of randomization that it can cause teams, especially if it's not super well thought through.
117
So I'm trying to see what are the great parts of that that I can bring to different roles.
118
But that concept of daily meeting, if there's something super urgent, how can you own it directly and run it yourself, where you are in the details, so your team knows that they need to be in the details and then be able to execute that.
119
So I think that's probably the most fascinating.
120
There are several war stories.
121
I was there for two years and the amount of interesting stories that happened during that time is a lot.
122
But then maybe I can follow up later if you have specific questions there.
123
I would love to hear a war story.
124
This is definitely as interesting as I was expecting it to be.
125
So just what I'm hearing so far is just things that worked well for them to operate at this insane pace and scale is the entire leadership team meeting every single day, 11 p.m.
126
your time.
127
Hopefully better times for other folks around the world.
128
Well, there's some people in Sydney, Australia, so it was 1 a.m.
129
for them.
130
Oh, Sydney.
131
Okay, great.
132
This idea of a flat structure, yeah, it's interesting because I imagine that's not necessarily great for other reasons.
133
And then this idea of being in the details.
134
What does it actually look like in real life at Binance?
135
So let me get an example.
136
So one of the areas that when I joined, one of the biggest kind of product problems we had was like crypto before was fairly unregulated.
137
So you could just sign up with an email address or even just a wallet and start trading.
138
There was almost zero friction.
139
And then it suddenly became regulated where you had to almost have a full KYC flow like a bank.
140
And that just meant that the conversion rate dropped from, let's say, 100% to like 2%.
141
And now we had to solve this problem.
142
This was the daily meeting level problem.
143
And it's okay if you're operating in one country.
144
You can do it easily.
145
If you're operating in 200 countries where there's not even a standard for what a document acceptance criteria might look like, now you have a significantly larger problem.
146
You cannot say, let's work with a KYC vendor and do the onboarding.
147
So we would need to, we had to literally have this, the top 50 countries, the top 10 document types.
148
So this spreadsheet of basically 500 cells, the conversion rate at each level.
149
And then we are looking at: okay, a passport in Kazakhstan has very low level of conversion.
150
What can we do about that?
151
Do we need a new vendor?
152
Do we need better imaging technology?
153
Do we need a new SDK from a vendor?
154
And then we go sell by cell based on, let's say, if I was running a typical product team, I would say, okay, let's just look at maybe the top 90 percentile of our users.
155
But this was Binance, and then see.
156
So then all of those 500 sales matter, no matter how low their impact to the conversion rate is.
157
So that's a little bit of Binance waiver there.
158
It's extreme customer focus.
159
And it doesn't really matter.
160
It's not that customers are not a number.
161
It's a person at the end of the screen, and we care about them.
162
So you would need to know, like, hey, you would get questioned that, like, why is the driver's license acceptance rate in Kenya falling suddenly?
163
So when you have, and that's just one piece of the problem in a large product with like 80 different products.
164
So you would, of course, cannot do it for every single product.
165
But the concept of like, what is the most leveraged decision you could be working on right now?
166
And if it is for your growth, it's the onboarding, then you better know exactly every single screen of the flow.
167
Why is there a drop-off?
168
And what are your teams doing for it?
169
So that level of detail.
170
And you just do it on different products at different parts of your journey.
171
I imagine there's people listening where they're like, there's the team responsible for the onboarding flow and KYC flow of their product.
172
And it's so hard.
173
They're like, oh, there's all these problems with our flow.
174
Imagine that for like 100 different versions of the flow across 100 different countries and documents.
175
So it gets very tricky.
176
And we also had resources.
177
At one point in time, we said, we had like a team of 20 people working on KYC.
178
And we said for the next three months, we want.
179
It has its downside, but if you're running in this kind of extreme mode, and you're less not as worried about just the team stress and personal development aspects of it, you're just purely looking at the execution of the product, there's a surprising amount of power that comes with it.
180
This was probably the second time in my career where I had that, wow, you can do this, because in other companies, it could take years to do it.
181
The first one was just going back at Google.
182
I remember I joined Google.
183
It was my first day at onboarding.
184
And I was the product manager for Gmail for mobile, for sync.
185
And I was in my onboarding meeting when they pulled me out and said, hey, we have an issue.
186
The service is down.
187
And Wall Street Journal is writing an article that Google, Microsoft, Apple not working together, causing the service to go down.
188
So we need you in this war room right now.
189
And there was a bug in iOS 4, this is a long time ago, which caused every single user to pull the entire Gmail inbox, re-sync the whole inbox.
190
So the bug on the Apple side is going to take two, three weeks to fix.
191
And it was causing like a thousand X load to our servers.
192
And I remember calling Urs, who was the head of infrastructure at Google, and he's like, sure, he slipped a button and there were 1000x servers that showed up for the next two weeks.
193
And I was like, wow, that is KO, right?
194
So this was my second time kind of feeling that wow moment where, like, oh, you just put 500 people in and solve the problem.
195
It's less about having the 500 people.
196
To close kind of the loop on some of these sort of radical ways of working, this idea of 50 reports per person and this idea of caring about a person in Congo not being able to sign up, do you think that's a good idea?
197
Do you take those in the way you work now, or is it just in this particular situation, it's important, other places maybe not?
198
There are several preconditions.
199
One is you're growing really fast.
200
So the growth for the employees comes just from seeing problems at scale that are growing every day, that it needs less of a manager's attention to figure out what you need to grow.
201
And the best way to grow in general is that you work at a really fast-growing company.
202
So if that's true, two, people are extremely well compensated.
203
So they care about the KPIs more than they care about what's the next stage in my career and how do I get promoted.
204
Because our bonus structure went from like 0% to like 500%.
205
So a lot of people didn't really care getting a 10%, 20% pay rate.
206
They just want to do incredible work because they know they would be taken care of.
207
And three, there's like some, it's a mission-driven company.
208
You still believe at the end of the day that you're doing this just beyond the KPI.
209
So at Binance, there was a very strong belief that 80% of the world doesn't have access to financial tools.
210
They don't even have access to currency that they can trust.
211
And when we see, look at, like, live in Europe or in the US, and we think about crypto, it's largely about speculation or Bitcoin.
212
For most of the world, they just need access to a US dollar stablecoin, right?
213
And just knowing that my currency is not getting kind of de-inflated because of things beyond my control.
214
So, everyone, having come from these kinds of our employees across all these countries, they had a very strong mission believe that what we are doing will truly empower billions of people.
215
And there's a power in that.
216
Like, a lot of people go through like, hey, I'm going to move mountains because it's not just about the money, it's just not about my career.
217
It's about doing something that will change the world.
218
Let's follow this thread on accelerating your career and talk about where you're at today in 26.
219
So, as you know, I've been doing a bunch of research on which companies hire and produce the best product managers.
220
I've done a couple passes at this, and N26 has come up in the top five of both ways of approaching this.
221
So, essentially, which companies' alumni go on to do the best in their career.
222
N26 is way up there.
223
I want to come at this from a couple of directions.
224
One is what N26 as a company does to hire and incubate the best people, but also just you personally, what your advice is to people and how you help them become great PMs.
225
So, let's actually start in that second bucket.
226
What is the most kind of common and most impactful career advice that you share with product managers that you manage that you find most helps them move ahead in their career and get unstuck in their career?
227
I think the number one thing I shared before: the best thing you can do is find companies that are growing fast because it kind of compounds your learning at a much faster interval.
228
Just the basic compound interest formula, right?
229
Like, it's if even if your interest rate is low, if you're compounding daily versus compounding.
230
Companies that are growing fast just lets you get that learning much, much quicker.
231
I remember joining Microsoft first in my career, some of the products I worked on during my internship had not shipped till I left Microsoft three, four years later.
232
That's a very, very low rate of compounding.
233
And Microsoft is a whole different company now, 20 years later, thankfully.
234
And then you contrast that something like Binance, where every day or every hour, every minute, you're shipping something and learning from it.
235
So the faster you can compound your learning, the faster you will grow.
236
The second piece, Chengdi, is like you need to optimize for what you're great at.
237
And now, after having two kids, I'm fairly in the fact that your strengths kind of get defined very, very early.
238
I'm looking at my nine-year-old and 12-year-old, and they have a whole different set of strengths.
239
So if you're like 25 years old, early in your career, it's very hard at that point to say, oh, here are all my weaknesses, and I need to improve on those.
240
A lot of the career feedback typically tends to be around, like, hey, here are the things you need to be better at.
241
Why don't you do more of that stuff?
242
Firmly in the camp that you need to know what you're great at, what are your superpowers, and you need to find jobs where success is determined by how much of that superpowers you get to use.
243
And early in your career, you can't get away with the fact that there's some stuff you're not going to be great at, and you just have to manage around it.
244
If you get higher up in your career, then it gets easier because you can build a team that complements your strengths.
245
But again, if you're early in your career, find places that if you're a great kind of creative person, if you can look at a product and think of 100 things you can do better, you're always about what's the next best thing and how quickly can I implement it.
246
You need to be working in teams that have a high experimentation culture, need to be working in growth teams in large companies.
247
If you work in a fintech company on a compliance-side project or launching a new business vertical, you're going to struggle.
248
At the same time, if you have extreme management, like structured thinking, you have great stakeholder management, you have high EQ, you should work in teams where there's a large amount of complex people management and process management.
249
You would struggle in a kind of a growth team where the expectation is you do things really quickly.
250
So I would look at first, very introspectively, what are my true strengths?
251
What do I, and then look at jobs where that has a much higher profile of winning.
252
And thirdly, like largely, I would say, do not optimize for compensation, especially early in your career.
253
If you're truly on a track to become like an executive someday or found your own company and make it successful, you'll find that the compensation is so much backloaded that you would make 90% of your compensation in the last five years of your career.
254
So optimizing for 10%, 20% early in your career.
255
So if you have two jobs and I would like to rank in your first 15 years of your career, I would say do not look at the compensation.
256
And then the last one, this was kind of strange.
257
Like, I never thought about this longer, but now I think it's probably the most interesting advice I can give people: determine very early in your career if you truly want to be a C-level someday.
258
You want to be an executor someday.
259
Because it's almost like if you're ambitious and successful, you enter product management, you're in like top of your, it's almost like an expectation of you that you would become that.
260
And you'd never really challenge or question yourself, like, is this the thing that needs me that I need to do to get there?
261
Is that something I'm going to truly enjoy?
262
Not just the destination, but the process to get there.
263
And a lot of people think that and they make sub-optimal decisions based on that.
264
There's like incredible careers you can build and incredible lives that you can live by just being great at what you do, doing more of that stuff, and you end your career maybe as a director, maybe as a group product manager.
265
But throughout the stuff, you have like built a holistic life that doesn't revolve around your work and gives incredible meaning to you.
266
Or you can be saying, you know what, work is a huge part of my identity.
267
Somebody asks me what wakes me up in the morning and what gives me that energy, it's my work.
268
I can't separate my identity from your work, then maybe you should pursue that C-level path because it will truly be fulfilling and you would be able to make those challenges and sacrifices that are going to be asked of you to make that.
269
So if you can calibrate that early and have that true conversation with yourself, like, yes, I want to go down that path and I want to do, you would make different career choices.
270
And in that path, I would definitely say, don't look at compensation.
271
There are two jobs, look at the three.
272
Is it going to give me high compounding of learning?
273
Is it a high overlap with my strengths?
274
And is it, am I going to have a lot of fun doing it?
275
Because if you have fun doing it, then it becomes a virtuous cycle and you do more of it and you're great at it.
276
On the question of: do you want to decide if you want to be a CPO, essentially, is the implication there is if you do, that's like a big sacrifice, you're going to be stressed, work-life balance is worse.
277
Is that the kind of thing?
278
No, no, no, no, absolutely.
279
It's like if you truly enjoy your work and what you're doing, it won't feel like a sacrifice.
280
When you're constantly, when you look at a new product, you're walking down the street, you see a new product, you're on the app store, you see a new product, and you're like, oh, this is cool.
281
Oh, look how they're doing the onboarding.
282
Oh, look how the app store entry looks.
283
If that truly fills you up, it fills your cup.
284
Like every moment you're looking at why things can be better, how you can be better, how a certain thing, you would be, the sacrifice will not feel like sacrifices.
285
It'll not feel like you're working long hours.
286
You'll not feel like, hey, when you're talking to PMs and giving them some guidances, when you're building teams, when you're recruiting new people, all that stuff feels, it like fills your cup, right?
287
It doesn't drain it.
288
And then you would have incredible fun on the journey.
289
So it's less about your sacrifices or work-life balance.
290
The moment you start having those conversations, you are probably not on that track.
291
You should not be on that track.
292
Because the moment the word work-life balance comes, I think Jeff Bezos has this thing: that he hits the word because it means like they're opposing things that need to be balanced.
293
It needs to be work-life awesomeness or something.
294
But for some people, that comes naturally because that's how they're wired.
295
And those people should absolutely pursue it because it would be incredibly fulfilling.
296
And the things that are challenging would also feel not as onerous.
297
Whereas for everything else, it would feel like a sacrifice.
298
It could feel like something you need to balance.
299
And then you would, again, even if you're great at it, you're not going to have fun doing it.
300
And at some point, you will not be great at it.
301
For folks that are PMs today, like there's almost an implication their career is heading towards CPO eventually.
302
That's kind of like the ladder they're on.
303
What are the, say, top three most common other options you've seen, other paths you've seen of folks that you manage, so that people can think about, okay, I don't need to maybe just keep climbing this ladder.
304
There's these other directions I can go.
305
I think the number one, and that's, I think, back to your original question on M26, like if you work in incredibly high-growth companies, especially FinTech, where there's a higher visa, people end up being founders because it's probably a whole different kind of track we can go down on.
306
The founding your own company is probably the most kind of obvious/slash exciting alternate path.
307
The only thing I ask there is, like, again, the same question, like what you are good at and what you love doing.
308
The challenges with founding a company is like a large portion of running a company has nothing to do with building a great product, especially as the company gets bigger.
309
I've worked for founders now for 17 of my 20-year career, like Mikhail was my boss at Google, used to be a founder.
310
And the CEOs now, the thing they tell me when they hire me is like, I wish I had your job.
311
That's because that's what I used to do.
312
That's what I have loved doing.
313
And now I spend 90% of my time doing stuff that is not the stuff that I truly enjoy.
314
But folks enjoy building stuff.
315
As a PM, there are a lot of things you don't have control over.
316
And you feel like, hey, that's what's stopping me from growing.
317
That's what's stopping me from truly enjoying.
318
Founding is a great path.
319
You have that control now.
320
You own the decision making.
321
There's rarely times you can say, hey, this did not work because of that person.
322
If you're constantly hitting that, then founding is a great path for you.
323
Because then you have the ball control, for better or worse.
324
The other is just like, I mean, it's less about being a CPO and just growing your breadth and your depth instead of just the ladder.
325
So you are incredibly either getting specialized in a specific domain where there is now enough value for you to separate yourself from the pack.
326
Whether it's like in FinTech now, we have folks who are onboarding experts with KYC.
327
We have people who are fraud experts, but who have a really great understanding of how card schemes work and how MasterCards work and where can we get the right incentives for the user.
328
There are folks who are experts on customer loyalty and retention.
329
You build that domain expertise and then you realize that everyone needs that.
330
And that could be like an incredible way to specialize.
331
So you may not be, you may need growth, et cetera.
332
And the third one, again, just not to knock it out, is you have, you realize that work is not going to be my big part of my identity.
333
My identity is who am I as a parent, who am I as a community member, who am I as a son to my parents, who am I as an artist or a contributor, and that's what my death is going to be a well-rounded person.
334
And a job is great, I'm great at it, but I'm going to do it as much as it's needed.
335
And the value and meaning, the top part of the Maslow's pyramid, comes from everything but work.
336
And then you just lead a kind of a balanced life because then work is a certain portion of it, and the rest kind of fills the picture.
337
So, just to summarize these four really good pieces of advice for how to essentially keep your career going and get unstuck and accelerate it, is work at companies that are really high growth because your learnings will compound.
338
And also, the network you build, you didn't even mention that, that becomes really valuable because, especially if the company does well, sometimes companies grow really well, and there's extra benefits there.
339
But even if they aren't, you still learn a lot.
340
Absolutely.
341
But that's N26, like one of the reasons why they have so many founders is the fact that it was a category-defining, like we were the first kind of mobile bank.
342
So, a lot of the problems we saw in the early days, nobody else saw them.
343
So, every product manager had to solve it for the very first time in history.
344
And that kind of is a whole different level of kind of trial by fire.
345
Same thing with the revenue.
346
Like, they've all started about.
347
Those are the companies that show up in the top rankings because you did this before anybody could do it.
348
And you learn by literally mowing mountains.
349
I think two is also the fact that you see we have this whole PayPal mafia, right?
350
Like when you see this early success, everyone sees it together.
351
So when they go, they have that network, as you said, built in.
352
These are, like maybe it's a product manager who starts a company, but maybe there is a business development manager who has also started his company and now you can collaborate and have partnerships.
353
So that success, the mutual success, which a lot of early startups see, that creates a kind of a more denser network than you working at a large company where not all of you see the success at the same time.
354
And three, I just comes down to the founders as well.
355
Like they're incredibly mission-driven founders.
356
I always find it super admiring now when I look back at Valentin and Max here at N26 or I look at CZ.
357
Like they have reached from a whatever metric you can define of success, whether it's the size of the company, whether it's their personal net worth, beyond whatever anybody would think success means.
358
And then to wake up every day and to do this hours and hours single day, every single day, you are driven by a whole, these are the voyagers of the folks who would go explore new planets in the future, or the folks who sailed out on the seas in the 1600s to discover new land.
359
And that being accessed to these people directly is excellent.
360
If you have an X definition of success, now your definition of success is 10X.
361
You automatically push the boundaries more.
362
So I think those two things, those three things, early start, category defining companies, mutual success and creation of dense networks, and just being inspired by incredibly, incredibly successful and talented people.
363
You pointed out this really interesting insight that I forgot to mention with the list of companies that seem to hire and create the strongest PMs.
364
There's a lot of fintech representation there.
365
And I think you touched on why that might be the case, because all these problems are extremely complicated and never been solved.
366
And you're solving at scale.
367
Here's the thing about FinTech, which is probably the most interesting, is FinTech, you have two customers.
368
You have your usual customers and you have your regulator.
369
And you need to keep both of them happy.
370
And usually what makes one happy, it makes the other one less happy.
371
So you are constantly dealing with trade-offs.
372
Like in most PMs, in most companies, you have some trade-offs, but they're not existential.
373
Whereas in FinTech, like every trade-off is existential.
374
Like when you found a company, every trade-off is existential.
375
You may not exist as a business if you make a wrong decision.
376
In FinTech, a lot of the PMs see that day in, day out.
377
And that probably kind of conditions them to a whole different level of juggling balls than you would be a PM at other company.
378
Yeah, that's such a good point.
379
Just like really good stakeholder management influence dealing with all these trade-offs.
380
I think that's a really good point.
381
I'm going to come back to the strength stuff because that's really important and I've been meaning to come back to it.
382
So just to reflect back, the four things you pointed out are really what you want to look for.
383
Companies that are growing really fast, working on things that you're good at, and finding a role that leverages your strengths versus things you're not good at.
384
Not optimizing for comp early, such a good point there.
385
Your point essentially is you'll make most of your comp later, like probably the 50%.
386
The second half of your career, you probably make, I don't know, 10 times more than you make the first part of your career.
387
And so, optimize for the future comp, not today's comp.
388
And then, this idea of making sure, ask yourself, do you want to be CPOs?
389
Do you want to go down the C-suite route, or do you want to maybe probably plan to start a company something else?
390
And that informs the role you're in.
391
Coming back to the strength stuff, how do people figure out their strengths?
392
Do you have any advice for someone sitting around or like, what am I actually good at?
393
I don't know.
394
So, there's several ways to do it.
395
I remember I read this book.
396
This was, I don't think it shaped my understanding of it because I was already operating in that mode, but it used to be called like, now discover your strengths.
397
I think, and now it's called like strength find 2.0.
398
It's still like 20 years old now, but there's a lot more newer ways to do it.
399
The two things I have done, and they're both kind of, I'm not sure how accessible they are, but I'll give you the examples.
400
So, at Agoda, we used to pay a psychologist $5,000 for every single PM we interview.
401
So, after you finish your PM rounds, we would send you to this psych assessment.
402
It would be a six-hour psych assessment, and they would tell me what your strengths are.
403
Not just that, it would be an IQ component, so we would know what percentile you are, and not just like an IQ score, like Einstein or not, like an IQ score across different, across pattern recognition or strength.
404
At Agoda, we literally hired the smartest people because we paid a psychologist a lot of money to tell whether they're smart or not.
405
But other than that, they also gave you your strengths and weaknesses.
406
It used to be called, I know it's a company still around, it's just called Q4.
407
And it's called Q4 because they had these four quadrants on two axes.
408
One is on dominance and one is on warmth.
409
So you want people who are high dominance, high warmth, so the Q4 quadrant.
410
And that, as you can realize, if you also want smart people, to find those who land in that quadrant is literally looking through a needle through a haystack.
411
But when I, I almost didn't do it.
412
Like I was like, this is like, I've been doing products for 15 years.
413
This is insulting that I need to go do a six hour.
414
The only reason I did it at that time was my son was like four and a half years old.
415
And I was teaching him like, because I go to kindergarten, I was starting to do some math with him.
416
And then in like six months, he knew all the math that I knew.
417
Like he was solving quadratic equations and stuff.
418
And we thought, oh, we have a genius in the house.
419
We got to get him tested.
420
So we were testing him.
421
And that's the only reason I took this test because I thought, hey, it would be interesting to understand what this process looks like.
422
But then when I got the results, I was like, it was so spot on.
423
It was incredibly spot on.
424
It's saying areas where I would do well, areas where I would struggle and need help.
425
So that's one way to do it.
426
It's super extreme.
427
A little bit a year, two years ago, we had the fortune, CZ is good friends with Ray Dalio.
428
So we had Ray Dalio come to our executive.
429
So he has a, that one is a lot more accessible.
430
I think it costs like $50.
431
You can go to, I think we search for Ray Dalio's strengths.
432
There's a website that you can go.
433
And the way it works slightly differently for executives because you do it.
434
So there's a Your component, which tells you how good you think you are.
435
And then it has your leadership team vote you on certain different aspects.
436
So there's a two-layer assessment, how good you think you are, and how good everybody else thinks you are.
437
And then the overlap is where your true strengths are.
438
And as a CEO, I can say, oh, Mayer is great at design.
439
Everybody else knows that Mayer is great at design.
440
We should give design problems to Mayor.
441
So that's another way of kind of, so there's a scientific way of doing this.
442
It's gotten a lot better since I read that book a long time ago.
443
Again, if you're truly, truly curious, it doesn't take that long and now it's a lot more accessible.
444
That's one way to do it.
445
And it kind of separates in terms of execution, in terms of structured thinking, innovation and design, creativity, stakeholder management, EQ.
446
Like you get a little bit of a more scientific picture on what your strengths are.
447
But there's also a simpler way, right?
448
Like you know, there's as a PM, you do pretty much a large portion, everybody does the same few things.
449
You think you're designing the roadmap, you're coming up with what you think is the product strategy.
450
There's a lot of time around just managing engineers, making sure they do stuff.
451
There's stakeholder management, marketing, compliance, whatever.
452
There's launch and just tracking.
453
Some jobs require more of one versus the other.
454
And you just know when you do these things, which ones, one, you're truly great at, and you have a lot of fun doing.
455
Maybe you just don't like Jira and the ticket tracking and just following people on that.
456
And that's the worst part of your job.
457
Stay away from more structured, complex stakeholder management jobs.
458
Or you find that, hey, you do really well at that.
459
And somebody asks you, hey, what are the 15 things we're going to do next week to improve our conversion?
460
That's where you kind of have a hard time.
461
You just sit down and spend hours thinking about it.
462
Then maybe that's not your strength.
463
So over time, you kind of build this self-calibration on areas that you have fun doing and areas where you don't have.
464
And then when you look at the next job, just try and gauge.
465
Are they hiring me?
466
Because I did really well at some of the stuff that I didn't love doing.
467
And if that's what they're hiring you for, probably you're not going to have a lot of fun or high acceleration if you go there.
468
There's so much there.
469
There's an important point that I'll add, and I'm curious if you agree.
470
A lot of new people or like new people in their career are like, oh, I just want to think about strategy.
471
I'm going to think about the big picture.
472
I don't want to just sit there and optimize the roadmap and be in JIRA.
473
But it's actually, that's your job when you're just starting out.
474
You need to earn the right to contribute to the vision, to the strategy.
475
This is one of the, and there's a pre-conversation you talk about, contrary and view.
476
Like, product strategy, by definition, seems like a, this is going to be a very important thing.
477
Those two words feel very at odds with each other for me.
478
Like, a product, you have a hypothesis, you know.
479
And if you can test it, you don't need a strategy.
480
If I say, hey, if I build this, and I know this will add this much users in this time with this conversion rate, this customer acquisition cost and this LTV, that's your hypothesis.
481
And you could test it in the market very quickly.
482
And if it works, you have your strategy.
483
Keep doing more of it.
484
Strategy is always like keep doing more of it or don't do it.
485
That's all there is to strategy.
486
The key part is just figuring out which one goes in which bucket.
487
And if you're really executing fast enough in a kind of a structured experimentation-driven manner, your strategy becomes a largely, largely solved problem.
488
So for most, like, and that's a challenge.
489
A lot of people think that strategy is about looking at Porter Sport forces, a lot of slides, looking at some data and slicing it and saying we need to go here or there.
490
All of it is largely some sort of package intuition.
491
And the challenge with that is usually you go with the loudest voice in the room.
492
And if you're a junior in your career, it's a very frustrating exercise because you think you know the strategy better.
493
But it's all it is, it's a sense of package intuition.
494
And then the guy with the loudest, biggest title or the loudest voice is going to go do it.
495
Because very early in my career, Jonathan Rosenberg, he was the head of, he was the CPO at Google.
496
All the PMs reported.
497
And he had this one thing he would say all the time: come to me with data.
498
If you come to me with ideas, we'll go with mine.
499
That was the same.
500
It's like, you can come with any ideas.
501
I'm just going to do what I think.
502
But unless you come with a strong sense of proof to override me.
503
So, again, strategy is a little bit overrated for product.
504
So, market expansions, for investments, for licenses, compliance.
505
There's several areas where it makes sense and it's kind of useful.
506
But for most product managers, your strategy should be: how fast can I go from hypothesis to data?
507
The faster you can go there, the easier your strategy gets.
508
That is certainly a hot take.
509
So, the idea here, I'm curious how you operationalize this with folks at N26, is it just like, I don't need to see a whole strategy for the year.
510
Just give me, here's the plan, here's what we're going to test, here's our hypothesis.
511
Have you actually, what do you tell your PM team?
512
We use this tool.
513
I'm going to give a shout-out to StatSig because they're awesome.
514
Vijay, who used to run the experimentation at Facebook, he's been awesome, now has this tool.
515
There are several of those, but if you're running proper experiments, I just look at the StatSig dashboards, right?
516
And I'm looking at experiments, I'm looking at what metrics they're moving, I'm looking at the p-value, I'm looking at how quickly they can get to statistical significance.
517
And I'm like, oh, this is working, let's do more of these.
518
So, now there are some areas where you can't do it, like in compliance, in like legal.
519
In Europe, it's a little bit different.
520
So, those areas you would need to have a lot more kind of deeper thinking, understanding of your cohorts.
521
You're coming up with a more structured reason for why you should do it.
522
But you can't really test and know within a couple of days or a couple of weeks at max whether this was a good idea or not.
523
Those, if they're either irreversible decisions or they're just extremely time-consuming to find out, then do some pre-work.
524
Look at largely, find a lot of companies that really look at data without looking at cohorts.
525
You make completely bad decisions, right?
526
Because if you look at your dashboard, it's a mixture of users over 10 years, 20 years, even six months, and they all behave differently.
527
If you look at a cohort-level development of certain users, you generally end up making better decisions.
528
But even over there, it's still a lot more, there's a lot of noise between the moment you start tracking it, then the moment you start making decisions based on it.
529
The world has changed in that meantime.
530
In Binance, this was kind of a very foreign concept when I brought this in.
531
I'm like, oh, the conversion's down now, even though the product's done really well, because Bitcoin has crashed, right?
532
Nobody wants to go sign up for an exchange account.
533
So, if you just measure pre and post, you would think that you have done something wrong in the product.
534
If you measure it as an experiment, you would know that, yeah, between the variant and control, it's still doing great, even though overall conversion is down.
535
So, largely, the more you kind of one of the first things kind of do when I take on a role, the company.
536
So, for now, the first thing is to say, how can we bring it in?
537
First, the kind of right culture, the right incentives, and the right tools.
538
And then, once it's set up, it gets a lot of fun.
539
You get a lot of fun for the PMs because you have kind of democratized performance for the product managers.
540
And the second thing which I tell my PMs now, which is truly kind of empowering if you think about it, the challenge of being a product manager is everybody thinks they can do their job.
541
You go to the CFO might have an idea, the head of kind of accounting has an idea.
542
Anybody who uses the product thinks they have ideas, right?
543
So, at some point in time, you're like, what is my discipline?
544
Like, what is my science?
545
Nobody goes to the accounting guy and says, hey, this is how I have a great idea for how to cook our books.
546
Nobody does that because there's a science behind it.
547
There's a science for financial forecasting.
548
Even in technology, a lot of the times people just don't go and say, hey, just dump this thing and let's use this code that the AI code generator has used.
549
There's a little bit of science there.
550
Whereas in product, you largely find that it's a combination of data and ideas and stuff.
551
And anybody thinks they can, the moment you build experimentation, you've now made it scientific.
552
Now, somebody comes up with an idea, say, well, it's a bad idea.
553
Here, this is why it's a bad idea.
554
Because we have done this experiment six times and it has failed across this user groups at this exact level of impact created.
555
So it kind of gives the PMs the kind of, hey, Alison, I'm not just a general purpose technician.
556
So it's extremely empowering once we can, it takes a long time to move the team in that direction.
557
But once you get it there, the PMs just, it's a natural kind of dopamine head every time you run an experiment and see it more metrics.
558
I'm a huge fan of experimentation.
559
I think most guests on this podcast are on your side of the debate.
560
I feel like we could do a whole podcast episode on just how to create a culture of experimentation, how to change culture.
561
This episode is brought to you by Vanta, and I am very excited to have Christina Cassioppo, CEO and co-founder of Vanta, joining me for this very short conversation.
562
Great to be here.
563
Big fan of the podcast in the newsletter.
564
Vanta is a longtime sponsor of the show, but for some of our newer listeners, what does Vanta do and who is it for?
565
Sure.
566
So we started Vanta in 2018, focused on founders, helping them start to build out their security programs and get credit for all of that hard security work with compliance certifications like SOC 2 or ISO 2701.
567
Today, we currently help over 9,000 companies, including some startup household names like Atlassian, Ramp, and LangChain, start and scale their security programs and ultimately build trust by automating compliance, centralizing GRC, and accelerating security reviews.
568
That is awesome.
569
I know from experience that these things take a lot of time and a lot of resources, and nobody wants to spend time doing this.
570
That is very much our experience, both before the company and some extent during it.
571
But the idea is with automation, with AI, with software, we are helping customers build trust with prospects and customers in an efficient way.
572
And, you know, our joke, we started this compliance company, so you don't have to.
573
We appreciate you for.
574
That's V-A-N-T-A.com/slash Lenny for $1,000 off Anta.
575
Thanks for that, Christina.
576
Thank you.
577
I want to come back to the question of what N26 has done well to create and hire great VMs.
578
So we've spent a bunch of time on here's career advice that I often give and what helps people most in their career.
579
Is there anything, just to kind of close this thread, is there anything N26 did or is doing that either from the hiring perspective or from training?
580
I know you haven't been there from the beginning, just like as a business, as a company that they've done really well that other companies may want to copy?
581
Some of it is just the hiring philosophy, right?
582
Like we tend, like one of the advantages you get for being like a big fish in a small pond is you get to have your pick of the cream of the crop.
583
So in Europe here, where we don't have like the same level of unicorn or decacorn density you have in the Bay Area, being one of the first ones or the few ones, you do get a little bit of that branding working in your favor.
584
So some portion of that is just the input.
585
If you're taking really smart people, like very chance at N26 they will become, they will stay smart.
586
Two is again, the level of problems that they work on are harder.
587
Just the fintech angle we mentioned.
588
And now with this whole experimentation-driven kind of change that we made in the last year or so, there's also a new kind of toolkit that they get, especially if they're going for like a larger, big growth company that's the next step of the career.
589
Once you kind of companies that are truly world-class at experimentation is so low that if you work at one of these companies and you build this tool set, you can build a whole career on this.
590
You can go to any other company and say, this is what I'm going to bring to the table, because there's no growth without, as I said, without compounding, wins faster, and nothing compounds wins faster than experiments.
591
And there's no company out in the world that says, we don't want to grow.
592
So that is an incredible kind of brand that you can build alongside with it.
593
And then the third piece is just the scale.
594
One of the other interesting aspects of banking is what I call a 100% product.
595
And actually, more than 100%.
596
There are more bank accounts than human beings.
597
Because a lot of people have more than one bank account.
598
So you never run out of target addressable market.
599
It's as big as it can get, which means that there's no upper bound on how much, because at some point, if you're, I don't know, building kind of an AI code generator, like your market is capped, and maybe developers or people want to be developers.
600
Or you're building, I don't know, AWS.
601
It's a massive market, but it's still like all the companies that need online hosting.
602
Look at banking, everybody needs.
603
And the fact that it's oldest or the second oldest, depending on how risky you are or not, or profession known to man, right?
604
It is a self-hedged product.
605
Like when things get tough on one side of our business, the interest rates, let's say, go high, spending goes down, but we make money on.
606
So it's a very self-hedged business that lets you kind of go through the troughs and the peaks kind of better than most companies.
607
And that understanding that how do you build naturally hedged products is probably another kind of reason why it just influences how you make decisions and how do you kind of scale the core product portfolio.
608
Just one example, like we, for the longest portfolio, like about a year and a half ago, we were largely a bank with a card.
609
And that was, we were the first mobile bank, and that was a big enough market.
610
But in the last year or so, we have just flashed out that product portfolio.
611
We have a big lending portfolio now.
612
We launched savings last year.
613
We invested heavily in savings because the interest rates were high.
614
It was a super amazing tool to attract new users by offering high interest rates.
615
But as the interest rates are going down now, we're just investing heavily in lending because now you can get loans for lower prices, which was super hard to get last year.
616
So being able to kind of build products that complement the macro also gives you that kind of additional kind of balancing act that you don't get in typical single-focus companies.
617
So I think it's a combination of a few of those things.
618
Being able to get great talent, being able to kind of train them now more so, and especially around experimentation, and just seeing how you can build a product portfolio that complements each other, but also naturally hedges against each other, just gives you a better, kind of well-balanced way to operate.
619
I think this explains something really interesting.
620
As you're talking, I realized that a lot of these companies that produce the best PMs are, to your point, non-US based, but incredibly successful in their location.
621
And so it draws in the most talented people in that region.
622
So, like, and I know Intercom, I think, technically is, so Intercom was number one on this list of companies that produce the best PMs.
623
Intercom, Palantir, Revolut, and then N26, Chime Stripe, Dropbox were kind of at the top.
624
And four of those essentially are, or three of those are non-like, Intercom, I think, was Ireland.
625
For a lot of their team is based in Ireland, then Refalut is the UK.
626
And then you guys.
627
So it's interesting that that explains some really interesting insights: just be the best, be the big fish in a small pond, draw in the best talent, and then work on really hard problems and be really successful.
628
There you go.
629
There's a formula.
630
Yes.
631
Yes.
632
It's very simple where you put it that way.
633
Oh, man.
634
Okay.
635
You interestingly have worked in a lot of different places.
636
I want to spend a little time here.
637
So you've worked in Europe, you've worked in Asia, you worked in the U.S., obviously.
638
For someone that is maybe thinking about moving out of the US or maybe moving to the US, what have you found are kind of the big trade-offs?
639
Yeah, so I would say like early career, you want to be in like intensely talent-dense areas for all the reasons that you mentioned before, finding the high-growth companies, finding the networks that will make you successful.
640
There's no, for general tech, there's no better place than West Coast or the US.
641
Now, now everybody doesn't have the option, especially now with the immigration policies and so forth.
642
I mean, things were always hard, they seem extremely harder now.
643
So you may not have that option, but if you do have that option, I would encourage everyone.
644
There's some exceptions, like for crypto, I would say Dubai is very strong, very great, has a really high density there.
645
But again, it's a very industry-specific.
646
Bangalore, if you're Indian, has managed to recreate some of the magic of Silicon Valley, not at the same scale, but getting better.
647
If you're in finance, maybe there's London, Singapore in Asia has now at least not as much new innovation, but each of the big companies has a presence there.
648
So, at least secondary talent density is there.
649
Those would be your options if the US is not available early in your career.
650
And in some ways, it helps define you.
651
If you work at Microsoft or Google or OpenAI or some of these companies that become brands later, it's something you can take with you.
652
When going part, the second part of your question is: if you decide to move, having that experience and that brand and that kind of achievements there can help you kind of make the find great opportunities elsewhere.
653
I mean, I've been a little bit privileged that some of these opportunities have found me, like N26 here in Europe or Binance before in Asia, where I wasn't really in that super talent-dense area in the first place.
654
But, like, luck's not a great strategy, right?
655
So, if you're planning for it, I would say build it, build your early career in the US.
656
And then, honestly, when we move.
657
We were just struggling in the US with both me and my wife working, both our kids in Seattle with Taiwan.
658
My daughter had asthma at that time, it was like, and she was just constantly sick, and it was a struggle for us to kind of manage both work and life.
659
And when I talked to Agura, I'd never heard of the company.
660
And the only reason I ended up taking the job was like, hey, Bangkok's a hot place.
661
I mean, my daughter might not have asthma there.
662
And we might have some health in the house.
663
So we could probably balance some of the things that are really not adding value to our life right now.
664
And that was the hypothesis there that we would be, I can do a lot more on work because I was literally not able to focus as much on everything else that was happening.
665
And as I said, everything on experimentation, we just hit a home run on all the hypothesis.
666
My daughter, like the heat cure, her asthma, my just having a support structure allowed us just as a family to spend a lot more time with each other and allowed me a lot more time to work and be on my career when I'm not doing dishes and not doing laundry and not throwing out the trash and not mowing the lawn.
667
There's just so much hours that show up in the day that you could be doing things that you're great at and kind of add to your career.
668
And then our just turned out to be just a, like a, almost like a boot camp for understanding how an experimentation-based product culture might work.
669
Because before that, I worked at Google, I worked at startups.
670
My whole screen to frame was like building big stuff.
671
And Aguirre just taught me that a lot of the growth comes with incredibly small things done faster.
672
So it's part of booking holding.
673
So if you heard of Booking.com, it's a $170 billion company.
674
And what's interesting is that 10 years ago, it was a $10 billion company, which sold flights, hotels, and cars.
675
10 years later, it still sells flights, hotels, and cars.
676
It's $170 billion company.
677
Oh, wow.
678
It's an incredible growth story.
679
And that tells you you really don't need, from a strategy perspective, to do something completely different if you can truly compound your growth by optimizing every single thing really, really well.
680
So there are the pros that come with, as I said, when you move, most of the time you're building products that are global, especially if you're based in the US.
681
Very few times you're building products that just work in the US.
682
Now, that's not true for a lot of the countries.
683
Like in India, a lot of products are only designed for the Indian market.
684
A lot of products in China are only designed for the Chinese market.
685
But in the US, you're designing products for the world.
686
And a lot of the times you don't experience the same constraints or you don't empathize with the user at the same level because you just haven't lived that user's life.
687
So in terms of just being able to calibrate yourself on what a global product might look like, being able to live in different places and understanding some of these constraints firsthand, definitely a pro.
688
You get to, as I said, especially if you have built that early rapidly.
689
And so that's, there's a hit to compensation, at least initially, for sure.
690
Like nobody pays anywhere close, especially here in Europe.
691
But as I said before, don't optimize for compensation early in your career or even the middle part of your career.
692
So if you follow that advice, it will not matter because you will have kind of something unique to offer.
693
Even if you come back to the US later, having kind of worked in different, having understanding, especially if you're in fintech where the actual laws are different in different countries, and that one you truly do not appreciate working in the US.
694
Even at Google and stuff, when we would launch products, I would be like, oh, the lawyers, they're just making life difficult.
695
But then when you now have a true appreciation of how different the world truly is, it just makes you a better stakeholder when you talk to the legal team, when you talk to the compliance team, when you talk to marketing.
696
So I think those are all the pros.
697
The compensation could be the con.
698
The other big con is that, like, today, if you're in Silicon Valley, like I spent 15 years in Seattle, I worked at four companies.
699
I could change jobs and stay in Seattle, right?
700
Because there's enough companies there.
701
It's never going to run a ceiling.
702
At some point, Bay Area, there's no ceiling.
703
You can keep growing.
704
The challenge now is that if I'm in Bangkok and working at Agwood, at some point I need to find a new job, or because, let's say, I'm at the CPO level, I want to be CEO now.
705
Agod already has a CEO.
706
So I need to find be a CEO somewhere else.
707
Then you hit somewhere over there, or then you hit another ceiling.
708
Now you need to move back or go somewhere else to Thailand, which I did.
709
And then you're like, oh, maybe there's a great opportunity in Europe, which will give you like a whole different scale.
710
Then you need to move to Spain, which I did.
711
So this, at some point, your family is like, what's happening?
712
Where it turned out to be, what turned out to be one step to go from A to B is now just an every-year journey.
713
And so that's something to calibrate, especially later in your career, that it's extremely hard if you like the job and don't like the location, or vice versa.
714
Because they usually come as a package deal now.
715
You see this in Bangkok now, where there's not that many great tech companies.
716
And if you're at Agoda and you're doing really well, but it's just one company, you just don't have options.
717
And especially if you love Bangkok, which is a great city, probably my vote for the best place to live in the world.
718
That's a struggle.
719
You love the city, but if you need to move your career ahead, you need to go somewhere else.
720
So interesting.
721
I feel like Thailand is very popular right now with White Lotus.
722
I think White Lotus had like the most views of any show or some crazy.
723
That's very popular.
724
I feel like there's a lot of tourism coming to Thailand more than this.
725
Yes.
726
Yeah.
727
I want to come back to one piece of advice that we were chatting about before we started recording that I think might be helpful to people, which is, and this is kind of in a different direction, but I want to make sure we touch on it, is Shrias Dosh.
728
He has this really good advice, and we'll point to the episode if people want to dig deeper around finding the highest leverage opportunities for you to work on as a PM.
729
Can you just share that advice for folks that haven't heard this before?
730
This is true for no matter what level of career you are in, but you have a finite amount of time, and largely you have more problems than you have time to solve them.
731
The question is which ones you work on, right?
732
And this becomes even harder, like let's say you're a CPO now, because all of them are important.
733
Otherwise, they will not come to you in the first place.
734
The question is, which one do you work on?
735
And the principle is simple.
736
You work on problems that have a 10x positive or a negative impact.
737
I mean, the number can be 10, 5, 3, 100.
738
Depending on Binance, it would be 100.
739
Some companies might be 3.
740
And in most fintech companies, one of two problems.
741
It's a growth problem or a compliance problem.
742
Because both of them can have a negative or positive 10x impact.
743
And that's what you focus on.
744
That's what you spend the bulk of your time.
745
What was interesting for me, my first executive role, so I was Google, I was a product manager.
746
I joined what was White Pages back then as a VP of product.
747
It was my first kind of.
748
And White Page is Alex, Algod, Seattle, founding legend, three companies, all unicorns now, incredible, very good personal friend and mentor.
749
What was truly interesting when I joined that, they're like, okay, this is your desk, this is the product area.
750
So we had two offices.
751
This is when everybody worked in the office, five days a week.
752
And I'm like, okay, where does Alex sit?
753
And I'm like, I didn't think about it because I thought his office is near accounting, right?
754
Then I find out he doesn't have an office, he has a like a floating desk.
755
Uh, so it's all the other desks were like fixed, but he had a movable desk, right?
756
And he would move his desk to one of the departments which you think had the highest leverage opportunity.
757
And he would sit there at that desk in that department till that either problem was solved or the opportunity was realized.
758
And then he would literally move his desk and then go to product or tag or finance.
759
And that was his way of like you could literally visualize him working on the highest leverage problem by his desk moving.
760
And then that combines that with what we talked before about details.
761
And a little bit, I think I didn't mention it about the humility that you need to have to be working the detail.
762
A lot of the times, especially later in your career, you're like, hey, this is above, this is beyond me, this is the lonely.
763
Why do I need to do that?
764
Like, I have so many PMs or data analysts or somebody who should do it.
765
Like, why is it, why would I do it?
766
And that was kind of, again, just a quick story there.
767
I remember we were trying to figure out our growth channels, and we found out that, hey, we are kind of really tapping out on paid, on social, on referrals.
768
But SEO was something we just hadn't worked on for a while.
769
We're building a caller ID app.
770
And what we wanted to do was when somebody types a phone number in Google, we want to be the first thing to say, hey, is this a spam call or not?
771
Or is this whose number it is?
772
And if we could, then we could get them to download our app.
773
I want to hire a product manager, focus purely on SEO.
774
And because I think that's one of our highest leverage areas right now.
775
And Alex is like, hey, the whole white page is I built based on SEO.
776
But people would type people's name, and the first name used to be a white pages link.
777
I'm like one of the best people in the world to work on SEO.
778
I'm like, yeah, so he's like, let me run this product.
779
And I'm like, okay, what do you mean?
780
He's like, no, no, I will be the product manager for this, for however long you need it.
781
I'm like, okay, how's it going?
782
He's like, don't worry about it.
783
Just tell me who are the engineers.
784
So again, he moved his desk to where that product team sat.
785
And for the next three months, he was the product manager on that Scrum.
786
So he would come to my product team meetings, give his update on what's happening with the SEO Scrum.
787
And then an hour later, I would be in the leadership meeting giving my update to him.
788
And truly, he was operating it saying, this is a high-leverage area for the company.
789
It's high leverage for my ERDS.
790
It should be high leverage for me.
791
I'm the best person to do it.
792
I'm going to be in the details and do it.
793
CZ same at Binance.
794
There were a lot of products that he would just run himself.
795
There were very few people at Binance who would say no to CZ.
796
But one of my lead PMs who worked on the products that CZ worked on, he would tell them no all the time.
797
And it would just baffle all the other executives.
798
Like, how is he saying no to CZ?
799
And none of us are doing it because, hey, that was his product area that CZ was working on.
800
And there was that mutual respect there that, hey, we know this thing, and he's going to say no to me because probably not a good idea.
801
So that humility and attention to detail is required to work on the high leverage problems a lot of the high leverage problems are not as I said not strategy decisions they are not like which markets to go after and stuff a lot of them are like why is why is this thing not working as well as it needs to be and a lot of time the devil is in the details and he need to you need to be over there so I think combining that knowing what is high leverage or not into both having the humility and the the patience to be able to go dig deeper and and solve that and some of them are like quick ones like if I'm looking today at let's say how many of our signed up users convert into a long-term long-term monthly daily active user right that could be like something I focus on for for a month because we're running a lot of experiments on like early onboarding screens early rewards early incentives early loyalty program and at some point it might be like oh the team's got it like I've given all my what I could do there it's functioning we have great cleans I can trust their execution on this then we just go focus on some of the compliance challenges that we have or fraud issues that we have in France those kind of being able to kind of the the only way that works for me is I keep a very free calendar because you cannot do this without that if you have hundreds of meetings hundreds of one-on-ones daily standard like a lot of like recurring meetings you just can't find time to go work on high leverage problems so that would be my kind of other stuff is like keep your you should have plenty of open spaces on your calendar a full calendar is a badge of shame, not a badge of honor.
802
These are awesome stories.
803
Just the metaphor of the moving desk is so good.
804
Like, that's the epitome of a, like, what you're describing is what people now call founder mode, where the founder just goes in in the details, working on the problem.
805
Brian Jewski actually did this at Airbnb while I was there.
806
He took on a new product and was the like mini CEO, essentially.
807
I don't know if he'd call himself the product manager because I don't think he loved product managers.
808
He kind of famously got rid of product managers, which he didn't actually.
809
But yeah, he did that very much.
810
So he sat with the team, kind of created a whole space for the team that he was in.
811
These are awesome stories and a really good example of just a founder using their power to unblock and finding the highest leverage opportunities.
812
To kind of start to close off our conversation, I'm going to take you to a couple recurring themes on this podcast, recurring segments on this podcast.
813
First, we're going to visit AI Corner.
814
And in AI Corner, I ask, what's a way that you have found to use AI, an AI tool, a bunch of AI tools in your work to work more efficiently, to work, to create better quality work?
815
I still haven't found a game changer for me personally.
816
It's something that I use right now, and I'm a little bit not sure that am I not doing something right, whether other people are, or I'm a little bit too jaded for it.
817
So we have a lot of, we have Gemini across the work, so for meeting notes and stuff, works great, especially for folks who don't meet it.
818
Use a tool called Writer for our copywriting and UX teams, especially because we are operating in Europe across several languages.
819
So being able to generate that very quickly, especially.
820
That's been a there are several tools now, but Writer just has kind of like the copywriting market is really well done over there.
821
If you ask me across N26, but even when we did this at Binance or at Agoda, there are three areas where AI is a complete game changer.
822
One is on coding.
823
Again, you can use whatever latest tool for prototyping or not, most value, especially for the companies I have worked at, which are fairly large companies, very large code bases, having some sort of co-pilot that's integrated with your repositories.
824
Rough data, maybe somewhere between 18 to 25% productivity boost for a developer, which is fairly massive.
825
So that's one category, game changer.
826
Customer support, game changer.
827
Whether we should do it at scale or not, that's a different kind of more ethical/slash human question to ask there.
828
But for solving like the bottom 70 percentile problems, why is my card declined?
829
Why is there a hold-on mechan?
830
What happened to the placement card I shipped?
831
Why has it not arrived?
832
Like basic questions, AI automating now, almost 60-70% of that.
833
Customers getting that real feedback, game changer.
834
And the last one is on just on fraud and being able to just understand patterns better on real customers versus not.
835
And Binance, we have this product where users could exchange crypto with each other.
836
Like I could pay you Bitcoin and get like Thai bath in return.
837
Huge amount of fraud.
838
And they're using AI just to understand language patterns of fraudsters versus not fraudsters.
839
Massive.
840
So again, at the company level, there is an incredible set of advancements across these three areas: developer productivity, customer support, and fraud.
841
But for me personally, I'm like, what would I use that suddenly makes me a better CPO?
842
I'm still struggling a little bit over there.
843
But it's not really, I don't think we need something at that level.
844
Because largely, what still remains the domain of humans is decision-making and taking the blunt of the impact of what decisions you make.
845
Because I would love to blame AI for some of my bad decisions.
846
That's not why they're not.
847
You can still do that.
848
You can still do that, even if it's not.
849
Yes, yes.
850
So, but again, hopeful to, I'm generally not a big fan of like, like the thing I call a little bit jaded.
851
Like, you have tools now that you write few things and they make a long essay for it.
852
And then you have tools that compress long essays into a few words.
853
You could have just said few words in the first place, right?
854
And saved the whole round trip.
855
It's like a reverse zip.
856
Remember when we had zip and it was a game changer, but there was a big file you needed to send over slow networks, so you compressed it and sent it and then expanded it.
857
We're doing the reverse now, right?
858
We have a small thing, we make it big, and then send it over, and somebody's making it small.
859
So that's, but on these three areas, if you're at all-scale companies, like if you don't have a great tool for developer productivity, you're not looking at like essential, basic LLM bots for deflecting customer service, and you're not looking at patterns around user transactions or user communications to detect fraud, like that's the first area I would focus on.
860
Okay, I'm going to take us to another recurring segment on the podcast.
861
It's called Fail Corner.
862
And the idea here is: folks, like you come on this podcast, there's all these wins, killing it, CPO this and that, and just move into Thailand.
863
It worked out incredibly.
864
What a win all the time.
865
In reality, that's not how things go.
866
So, the question to you here is: just what's the story of a failure in your career when things didn't go well and it was a big deal for you, and then what you learned from that experience, how that actually impacted you.
867
Yeah, so for a product side, like my probably most spectacular failure was, I was the first PM on Hangouts.
868
And if you ask Nicola, he will probably say he was my boss then.
869
It was an effort the size I've never seen before or after in my career.
870
We had thousands of people working for me.
871
We had entire power of Google.
872
We had Larry literally sitting with us saying we can do anything we want Chrome to do.
873
And we still didn't manage to build a great messaging product.
874
So, when I look at pure product sense, product decision making was, and there are several reasons.
875
Now, I had a luxury of 15 years to analyze that on solving for the wrong audience, solving for the wrong DNA of the company.
876
I have this premise that certain companies can never succeed at certain types of products, right?
877
Like Microsoft with mobile.
878
It's just the DNA of the founder actively acts against you succeeding there.
879
I would have said Google with Enterprise as well, but then Sundar came and Darry was no longer the CEO, and that's when Enterprise took off.
880
They literally had to change the CEO to kind of win in certain segments.
881
But more, and then again, I worked in Nagoda during COVID.
882
So, travel company during COVID, Binance during its probably most tumultuous area of compliance and government scrutiny.
883
So, a lot of missteps there around externalities.
884
I think one of the main kind of learnings from that is just don't take on projects that are going to be six months, a year, because you just generally don't have control over the macro.
885
Things just move way more faster.
886
And that's probably cemented my kind of now product philosophy of just doing small things so very quickly, spending most of the time doing that.
887
You still launch big products, but even over there, we try and kind of get early signals as soon as possible.
888
But because Ragoda, like one of the big projects we launched was we wanted to control the payments infrastructure for all the hotels.
889
And we thought if we had that device in the hotel's desk, so not only for bookings made online, but for everything that happens at the hotel, if we control that infrastructure, not only would we make money, but we had a touch point with the users that went beyond booking the travel.
890
Travel, as you know, is.
891
They would just go to Google and go to some other website.
892
So, we wanted that touch point that stayed with them and thought payments would be a great avenue to do that because that's something you do every day.
893
And again, we did it in the Buddha style.
894
So, we did the experiment.
895
We started very small.
896
I literally went to the mall and bought these $50 Android devices where we ran our software that people could just scan the credit card by a camera and charge it.
897
It was incredible.
898
We had thousands of hotels use it.
899
And then COVID hits, and then there's literally nobody going to hotels anymore.
900
But it took us like six, nine months because of the licenses and so to launch it.
901
And it, in hindsight, probably, I mean, you couldn't have thought of COVID with that sense, but still, the amount of time it took to launch the product was something we could have done better.
902
So, learnings for most of it is don't take too long to launch.
903
Don't take too long to validate your hypothesis.
904
The Hangout story is amazing.
905
It's like a classic product people now make fun of.
906
If it's just Google, why can't you get this right?
907
And it's been changed.
908
Names have changed 100 times.
909
Interestingly, Meat ended up being really good.
910
Like Google Meeting.
911
That's the last thing I did when I left Google.
912
Oh, okay.
913
Was I was like, after we built the Hangouts, they're like, okay, this is not going anywhere.
914
We're going to start this new product called Aloe, right?
915
It also didn't work.
916
One of the many names.
917
Yeah, but then I said, you know what, like, we should still, because I used to work for Android Enterprise team before.
918
I'm like, what would we do differently?
919
For, I still called it Hangouts for Enterprise, so they rebranded it later.
920
But that was my salvaging moment for, but from the sense, I mean, the Hangouts team invented WebRTC.
921
Now, every single communication in the world happens on WebRTC.
922
So if you think from the cultural and technological impact that the Hangouts team had, is insane.
923
This tool we are using, every single meeting product, every single WhatsApp voice calling, video calling, like every Zoom, everything runs on WebRTC.
924
So from a technology side, I think that was a pretty massive win that the team came up with that.
925
That's the power of having Chrome, having a browser also.
926
Just introducing the technology.
927
Yes, absolutely.
928
Final question before we get to a very exciting lightning round.
929
Is there anything else that you want to leave listeners with, or maybe a point you want to double down on, just to kind of leave a little last little nugget before we get to the lightning round?
930
I mean, just summarize, it depends on the audience.
931
A lot of the folks who probably listen to it are coming at from a perspective of, like, hey, how does this help me be better at my job tomorrow than I was today?
932
And for them, I would say, again, like, if you're truly working in areas where you think you're optimizing your strengths and having fun, just keep doing it.
933
And just keep that as your kind of North Star as you look at new pieces.
934
When you talk to new companies, try and evaluate the overlap of superpowers.
935
What is your superpower?
936
What is the company's superpower?
937
And will they feed each other?
938
If you get a very strong resonance there, I think that would be a great career step, irrespective of whether it's in Bangkok or Spain or however the compensation is going to be.
939
Because truly, you will find that you grow much faster because it's a kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy at that point.
940
But just keep looking for overlapping superpowers all the time.
941
And not just in professional life, like even the transcends beyond maybe even for relationships and stuff, like folks who are extremely complimenting strengths and superpowers feed each other, make for great life partners.
942
So there's maybe that analogy can be extended beyond your career.
943
Wow, that's a powerful point right there.
944
What a cool way to end that.
945
Well, with that, Mayur, we've reached our very exciting lightning round.
946
I've got five questions for you.
947
Are you ready?
948
Yeah, let's do it.
949
What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?
950
The one that I read most recently, so I'm generally don't read a lot of books because I read a lot of content, like small content, and tweets and substacks, discords, and WhatsApp messages.
951
And so book takes like a mind-share shift for me to go read a book.
952
The one I read most recently, which I thought was pretty amazing, and a lot of overlap with what I said today, the five kinds of wealth.
953
That one was very well articulated, especially the last point I made very early.
954
Like one of the pictures.
955
This book is probably an incredible structured way of thinking around it.
956
What is your wealth in terms of your health, your physical health, your mental health, your relationship health, your community, and your wealth that you're generating financial wealth?
957
How do you think holistically?
958
Because at the end of the day, you are what you optimize for.
959
If you optimize for financial wealth, you will become wealthy.
960
But you might not be wealthy in a full-spectrum manner.
961
The Strengths Finder 2.0, I said very early on, it's still an interesting book to just think about how you would think about your strengths.
962
But again, if you don't want to read the book, I would just do one of these kind of online quizzes for it.
963
But the five kinds of wealth and Strength Finder 2.0 would be what I would suggest.
964
The first book is by Sahil Bloom, friend of the podcast, holding all this stuff.
965
I forgot to mention the story briefly about the Strengths Finder stuff.
966
So actually, when I was leaving Airbnb and looking for my next thing and even thinking about leaving, I took a strengths test and I was working with the executive coach and I saw the results and she's like, what do you see in these results?
967
What are these results telling you?
968
I'm like, I don't know.
969
She's like, this tells me you should start your own company and work on your own.
970
All the strengths that are popping up here are things that you as a founder need.
971
And that really helps.
972
What's your one-person data point on that?
973
Was it a good one?
974
What was a good decision, you mean?
975
Yes.
976
Oh.
977
Relying on that strength test to make a career.
978
I am such a huge fan of Strengths Finder and any kind of strengths test.
979
And interestingly, people may be afraid of taking them because they'll be like, here's what I suck at.
980
It always makes you feel good.
981
It's like, here's the stuff you're good at.
982
And it's not like, here's what you're bad at.
983
It's just not your strength.
984
So it was a huge win for me.
985
I highly recommend it.
986
Especially if you're trying to make a career move.
987
So yeah, fully lined.
988
Okay.
989
Next question.
990
Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?
991
The one I saw that kind of like TV shows usually I watch to kind of give a downtime.
992
So usually I watch just periodic shows, The House or Big Bang Theory and stuff.
993
The one I saw recently that kind of shook me a little bit was adolescence.
994
Again, it's a tough topic around teenage mental health and violence in schools.
995
And just the way it was shot, like I would see the first episode, even if it's not your genre, because it's shot in a single camera motion.
996
And the whole episode for an hour, there's no cut.
997
The camera just keeps moving.
998
And it just makes like a bizarre.
999
You feel a little different than watching it, irrespective of the topic, which is also pretty intense.
1000
Just visually, you feel different.
1001
And if you're emotion sick, like me, like you really feel different.
1002
That's wonderful.
1003
Sounds like what a.
1004
I would watch that.
1005
I need to watch the white lotus because everybody keeps bringing it every time I tell them I'm from Thailand and I haven't seen it yet.
1006
So I'm behind on my meme culture a little bit.
1007
Yeah, you are.
1008
It's like you and like no one else has not seen it.
1009
You think you're the only person left.
1010
Yes, I'm the only one.
1011
Okay.
1012
Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?
1013
So product show.
1014
I spend most of my time using banking and trading products.
1015
And I would give a plug here.
1016
If you're in Europe, try N26 or even Revery, incredible product.
1017
If you're in the US, Robin Hood, just their motion design they've done and their onboarding is just a joy to use, whether you use it for banking or trading or just for their card.
1018
Just find the product design and motion, especially as you touch and swipe, incredibly done.
1019
Anything that Nikita Beard launches, so I just downloaded Bible Study or Bible Chat yesterday.
1020
I saw him tweet about that.
1021
It's like in the top 10 of all social apps.
1022
Yeah, it's like a Bible study.
1023
And I can tell why.
1024
I've got three messages right now to treat my anxiety by reading Bible today.
1025
And one of the time I was feeling slightly anxious.
1026
So maybe there's some magic there.
1027
But the one app that I would just, like, for personal, so I used to write, like in Hildi, I used to write poems growing up as a kid.
1028
And that was just now this app Suno.com, I can make songs from them.
1029
And they are incredible songs, at least I think so.
1030
Nobody else thinks it so far.
1031
But just the fact that you can write something and now you have a song is just magical.
1032
Like the first time that AI, I saw a use case.
1033
Again, I said it's nothing so far that makes me a better CPO right now.
1034
But as an artist or at least the bathroom artist, it's just incredible that you can think of something, you put it down there, and you can actually see what would a professional singer and a band and a musician, if they were to compose it, what it would look like.
1035
So that's probably like the recent times.
1036
So, Suno.com, they're onboarding FlowSocks and their growth product.
1037
If I were the PM on Suno, I would do things a lot differently, but their core tech is magical.
1038
I'm a huge fan.
1039
One of my favorite things to do with Suno, I think it's Suno.ai also, is just ask it to make a song in the style of a sea shanty.
1040
It's so fun.
1041
And they give you like a few options so you could be like, here's this version, that version.
1042
Yes, yes.
1043
Okay, two more questions.
1044
Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to find useful in work or in life?
1045
One I kind of relates to the things we talked about is there's no right or wrong decision, they're just slow and fast decisions.
1046
Now, there are some extreme caveats to that around if you're doing something that might kill your user, like healthcare or military or even compliance, which can kill your company, don't use it.
1047
But everywhere else, in general, it goes back to the strategy thing we talked about as well.
1048
A lot of the times, like if it's you make a wrong decision, if you make it fast enough, you would know it was wrong and you would correct it, and you would still do it faster than thinking once for the right decision.
1049
So, for anything that's irreversible, anything that's not gonna get you in jail or kill your company, no right or wrong decisions, just slower fast decisions.
1050
Final question.
1051
You've lived in a bunch of places.
1052
You've lived in Spain, Thailand, Mumbai, Seattle, I think Texas, even for some period for school.
1053
College.
1054
Okay.
1055
There's probably other places.
1056
Which has the best food?
1057
Bangkok.
1058
No, no question.
1059
Barcelona comes closer for some.
1060
But Bangkok, you can have a three-michigan star, like one of the top five restaurants in the world, spend like $500 a meal, or you can have a $1 street food, stirred-fried pork and rice with basil.
1061
Incredible.
1062
Just the spectrum of entire from the cheapest food you can think about, the most expensive food you can think of.
1063
In that same like one-kilometer walkable area, having like thousands of these, literally, just the density of food, like no one, no one comes closer.
1064
Barcelona has an incredible restaurant, like the best restaurant in the world is like a block away from here.
1065
It's called the Subutar.
1066
It takes like two years to get on the wait list there.
1067
But that's on one end of the spectrum.
1068
Barcelona probably comes close second.
1069
But that cheap get down 2 a.m., walk down, and have an incredible meal for a dollar, like nothing comes closer to Bangkok.
1070
This episode's a great ad for Thailand.
1071
Let's go.
1072
And you definitely got to watch White Lotus.
1073
Mayur, this was awesome.
1074
We covered so much ground.
1075
I feel like I got to know you so well.
1076
We covered so many lives of all of this.
1077
Yeah.
1078
We're not done yet.
1079
Two final questions.
1080
Where can folks find you online?
1081
If they want to reach out, maybe check out if there's roles at N26.
1082
And then how can listeners be useful to you?
1083
Find me, this one of the thing being old, is that I was one of the first users of LinkedIn.
1084
So LinkedIn.com/slash Mayur.
1085
Early basis of Facebook, so facebook.com/slash kamath or n26.com, mk at n26.com.
1086
Like if you're especially curious about how we do stuff here, we are hiring, we are growing really fast.
1087
As I said, banking is a great business to be in.
1088
We're not going to go out of flavor for the next few thousand years.
1089
So, if you're thinking of a career, you're thinking about Spain or thinking about Berlin, it's just a whole different, interesting lifestyle and different kind of product thinking.
1090
Please reach out on any of those channels.
1091
If you're in Europe, download our try N26.
1092
Like, we go by the motto, love your bank.
1093
Our founders say that people would rather go to a dentist than to a bank branch, and that's why we built this.
1094
We to me feel like for an everyday banking, like it's just use the app and you feel like I want to use my banking app every day.
1095
There's some bit of magic, which I didn't have that much contribution yet.
1096
I made it a little bit simple and seamless, but magic was there before.
1097
And so, if you're in Europe, you are looking for a new bank account, n26.com.
1098
There we go.
1099
