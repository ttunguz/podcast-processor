1
Haseeb, are you okay?
2
Hasib, do we need to get you a therapist?
3
I am not doing well.
4
Like a decentralization therapist?
5
Please, please.
6
Who is a decentralization therapist for you?
7
Vitalik, you and Vitalik need to go on a, on a, you go on a 10-day hike.
8
Vitalik doesn't have the EQ, though.
9
No, I need somebody with a softer touch than Vitalik.
10
Vitalik's a little too hard for me.
11
Not a dividend.
12
It's a tale of two ponds.
13
Now, your losses are on someone else's balance sheet.
14
Generally speaking, airdrops are kind of pointless anyways.
15
I managed trading firms who are very involved.
16
Vitalik.
17
The ultimate ponytail.
18
DeFi protocols are the antidote to this problem.
19
Hello, everybody.
20
Welcome to the Chopping Block.
21
Every couple of weeks, the four of us get together and give the industry insider perspective on the crypto topics of the day.
22
So quick intros.
23
First, we got Tom, the DeFi Maven and Master of Names.
24
Hello, everyone.
25
Next, we got Robert, the crypto connoisseur and czar of Superstate.
26
Salutations.
27
Next, we've got Tarun, the Giga Brain, and Grand Pubah at Gauntlet.
28
Yo.
29
And finally, I'm Haseb the head hype man at Dragonfly.
30
We're at real estate investors in crypto, but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice, or even life advice.
31
Please see choppingblock.xyz for more disclosures.
32
So we finally got the gang back together.
33
It feels like crypto once again is humming, and we are now seemingly out of this Bitcoin consolidation cycle.
34
Bitcoin's at pretty close to an all-time high.
35
It's roughly in the order of 110K, kind of bouncing around up and down.
36
But alts are finally starting to move again.
37
And kind of on queue, alongside Alts moving, we have a gigantic hack that is now worth talking about.
38
So this hack took place on Sui.
39
Sui, of course, has been one of the standout winners of the cycle, has been growing like crazy.
40
And the main DEX on Sui is a protocol called CEDUS, C-E-T-U-S.
41
So CEDUS is a concentrated AMM liquidity protocol.
42
It's a DEX.
43
You can trade random tokens on Sui.
44
And CEDUS was hacked using a bug in their smart contract math library.
45
There was some bug around them trying to check the wrong byte length on the integers they were using.
46
So, instead of using 256-bit math, it was supposed to be 192-bit math, or maybe vice versa.
47
Whatever, it doesn't really matter.
48
Point is, the hacker was able to hack $223 million.
49
And using the hacked funds, they started bridging them over immediately to move them into Ethereum to start trying to get away with the money.
50
But, not so fast, SWE validators decided to freeze the accounts of the smart contract hacker to make it so that all other SWE protocols could continue operating and all other addresses could continue operating.
51
But the validators would, quote-unquote, agree to ignore transactions from the hacker.
52
So, this basically means that the validators agreed to freeze the accounts until further notice.
53
Right now, the accounts are still frozen.
54
No decision yet on what the validators are going to do until they come together with governance and decide to stop ignoring transactions from the attacker.
55
So far, there's 162 million of that 223 million, so the majority of it is still sitting frozen on Sui.
56
And as a result of this, there was one, a lot of people getting angry on Twitter saying that, hey, this is centralization.
57
This is not the way the blockchain is supposed to work.
58
There was also accusations toward the team that they were responsible for another protocol before on Solana, which also was a concentrated liquidity AMM that also suffered a similar kind of flash loan-style attack based on some bug in the smart contracts.
59
So, all in all, it seems like a very messy situation in Sui land.
60
And you saw a large drawdown in SWEEE assets that has since partially recovered, and SWEE as a protocol has mostly recovered the losses since this hack took place.
61
And I think there's a negotiation going on to try to get at least the hacked funds out in exchange for a $5 million bounty.
62
But that has so far seemingly not been claimed.
63
So that's the high level.
64
What are your thoughts so far on this hack and what it means for this whole situation about, I remember it was a few years ago there was a big hack on Blast, and people were talking about, you know, would it make sense for the bridge to freeze the stolen funds and basically play a vigilante or like, you know, try to come in there and make the people whole who'd gotten hacked?
65
This is the reality that we were talking about hypothetically at that time, which is that they have the hacker red-handed.
66
They're holding on to the money.
67
They're not letting the hacker go.
68
What should be done here?
69
And is it time to just go ahead and play it forward and say, look, this is not the Wild West anymore.
70
These are not the days of the DAO.
71
You just do the right thing when the right thing is available to be done.
72
Or do we feel like, hey, this is a norm that's going to lead to more and more of an on-chain, quote-unquote, police state?
73
And that's going to be the reality going forward.
74
What are your guys' thoughts?
75
Well, this is kind of a throwback conversation, right?
76
This was a very popular conversation in 2016, 2018, 2019.
77
And we haven't been having it as a community as much recently.
78
And that's because over time, because most of the DeFi activity and most of the hacks were sort of centered on Ethereum for the most part, there was no rollback.
79
There was no freezing.
80
There was no chain-level response and mitigation.
81
And because in some ways, Ethereum macro, right?
82
Like if there's a hack of a DeFi protocol today on Ethereum, nothing's happening besides the protocol itself or the application has to deal with it.
83
And so, you know, I think society in general has settled on the fact that L1s should be decentralized as much as possible and not really in the business of censoring specific addresses, specific transactions, and being responsible for figuring out where to draw the line.
84
Because it's a slippery slope and it starts off relatively easy.
85
Like, this is obviously a bad guy.
86
This is obviously a hacker.
87
This is obviously, you know, someone that should be stopped.
88
But, you know, what an end user wants from an L1, what an application developer wants from an L1, is a transaction environment that is completely predictable and the rules are extremely clear.
89
When you start getting into hazy rules about how consensus operates or how address censorship operates, it's less appealing to build there.
90
And so I think the result of all of this is that they'll figure it out.
91
They'll figure out what to do with the funds.
92
They'll figure out how to get it back.
93
They'll figure out how to negotiate with the guy.
94
They'll do all of that stuff.
95
And either they outgrow censorship as a chain permanently, or it becomes a part of the culture.
96
And it's like, hey, if you do business here, just understand that we have the ability to have the validator censure users, you know, applications, use cases, whatever.
97
And so I think they'll go.
98
Do you think it was a mistake?
99
Or do you think, like, hey, you're on Training Wheels, you're an early ecosystem, this is the right move?
100
Well, I mean, it was the largest application on the chain, right?
101
I mean, it was equivalent in that respect to the DAO on Ethereum back in the day, right?
102
Kind of, right?
103
In absolute terms, it's not that much of the market cap of Sui, whereas for the DAO, it actually was like 8% of all ETH or something like that in the DAO.
104
So it was in the DA.
105
Whereas in this case, literally the guy was just trying to dump the SWE and get into Ether.
106
Totally.
107
So I think they'll solve this.
108
I think at the end of the day, if they don't get back into the business of censoring addresses, this will sort of go away.
109
It'll be water underneath.
110
But do you think right decision or wrong decision?
111
What's your verdict?
112
Personally, I think wrong decision.
113
I think you want a culture of absolutely robust transactions and validators that don't have to be listening for special instructions manually in response to crises.
114
So I kind of think it's the wrong direction personally, but both outcomes work.
115
I will say, I was in the SWE group chat and I made a joke about Sui Classic and no one understood it.
116
That's so sad.
117
You know what I mean?
118
It's like the whole generation of people who use SWEE probably don't know what Ethereum Classic is.
119
Do you want to explain that joke for those in the audience who don't get it?
120
Yeah, so when the DAO happened, there was a fork of Ethereum called Ethereum Classic, which still exists and in fact has exchange-traded products.
121
No, it was not the fork of Ethereum, actually.
122
Really Ethereum.
123
Sorry, Ethereum.
124
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
125
Ethereum, the current Ethereum is the fork.
126
Correct, correct, correct.
127
The current Ethereum is the fork that removed that DAO hack.
128
But then there was a group that wanted to keep the DAO hack in and not censor.
129
And it still continues to this day under the ticker ETC.
130
And it's certainly one of the boomer coins that you see at like sometimes you will see like ETC on like CNBC or Bloomberg or something and you're like, why is that getting listed on this TV screen?
131
But it's like a non-trivial market cap coin.
132
I don't think it has any real usage.
133
The last time I remember hearing anything about ETC was, if you remember, around the Ethereum merge when Ethereum switched to proof of stake, there were all these people who were like...
134
trying to avoid doing it.
135
That was led by a bunch of old Ethereum Classic miners.
136
But anyway, my point is, no one got the joke.
137
So I think crypto does have this funny thing where like...
138
Does this mean we're getting old through it?
139
That might be what that means.
140
The lessons just keep getting relearned.
141
You know what I mean?
142
Like, there's no collective memory in decentralized systems, which can sometimes be.
143
Well, but I want to know, because you're closer to the Suite.
144
You guys are investors in Sui, if I'm not mistaken.
145
Yeah.
146
So you guys are closer to the Sui world.
147
Is there, like, my perception of this is that it's not actually like Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, because with Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, there was this real philosophical rift at the center of the community.
148
And my sense is that there's a lot of people on Twitter saying, oh my God, how can you do this?
149
Like the kind of sentiment similar to what Robert articulated.
150
But my sense is that people within Sui are not feeling like that's not happening within Sui.
151
That's like an outsider thing of people saying like, oh, screw you.
152
People in Sui are like, yeah, that was the right answer.
153
Of course, we should get the money back and like not let our ecosystem fall into the ocean.
154
I think you're probably correct, although I don't think it's like uniformly accepted in Suite.
155
But I do think it's more, the majority probably agrees with that sentiment.
156
But is there like a civil war happening within Sui?
157
Because I don't sense that that's happening.
158
I don't see, yeah, yeah.
159
In fact, it seems like everyone's pretty unified and like we need to spend more on security, right?
160
Like this, Mistin and a bunch of projects like announced they're like spending more on security.
161
Misten, I think, is going to now sponsor audits for like every sufficiently big protocol and stuff like that.
162
So I think actually the interesting thing is the response I thought was actually quite good of like, hey, we're going to spend more on security, which you don't often see.
163
in response to hacks.
164
You know, like exceptions are like Euler Finance, right?
165
Where like they got an incredible number of audits after their hack, right?
166
But like that's a rarity.
167
There's a lot of hacks where the hack happens and someone just hits restart and doesn't really, they don't really update stuff.
168
And so I think like, I thought that was like an interesting community response.
169
So yeah, that's sort of the vibe I got also.
170
But there are people who I think are a little militant about it.
171
Actually, the interesting thing was like everyone who was complaining about the censorship that I observed was like an Ethereum or Solana person.
172
Like there, I didn't see that many people who had .sui in their username complaining, which is like what you're saying.
173
But that goes for a collective memory.
174
Yeah.
175
I mean, yeah, I guess maybe a point of clarification.
176
Is it that the basically the validators and Zoom been updated to the leader rejects transactions from this address?
177
Or is it literally like every single client is rejecting any block that has a transaction from this address?
178
Because if it's the latter, I mean, I feel like you've basically done a fork already versus the former.
179
I mean, it's a little bit kind of what happens in Ethereum land with MevBoost, right?
180
Of, hey, we're going to block all OFAC addresses from sending transactions to this builder.
181
And yeah, I mean, granted, if you're already in the network, you're going to accept those blocks, but it's difficult to even get in.
182
I think it's only like 8% of blocks.
183
Yeah, I mean, clearly it's not that, because if it was that, then the attacker would already be home-free, right?
184
Because it's not a super majority.
185
Yeah.
186
Yeah, I mean, I feel like you've basically forked already then, right?
187
Like, well, you're also sort of forgetting that Sui has three slot finalizations.
188
So, like, once you think about the finalization, that's like you only really need three slots to be fully done.
189
So, I think like that, in fact, this is an interesting thing that I hadn't quite thought about.
190
And I guess Cosmos people were not very good at articulating the benefit of finalization: is that like, yeah, you don't have to think about the arbitrary fork length stuff that you're describing.
191
Yeah, I did see some good memes of, you know, it's like the hello human resources meme, but it's for the hyperliquid hacker versus SUI.
192
And I do think it is, I mean, obviously, there's like bagholder bias where I think a lot of people who were pro hyperliquid were just large pipe holders.
193
And if anything, that was less egregious than exactly.
194
It wasn't even like a hack.
195
The system wasn't even at fault.
196
It was like an HLP loss.
197
But I think it was kind of lauded.
198
And it is like, it feels like there's been a little bit of a loss of, I mean, kind of this cypherpunk philosophical ethos where the, I mean, Ethereum DAO hack, I think it was the right decision, but like I said, it was very contentious.
199
Maybe the stuff is slightly contentious, but I don't even get the sense it's nearly as contentious as the original DAO hack was.
200
It's basically just people who had a token being in support of, being supportive of whatever is going to be long-term good for the chain, which in this case, I guess, is rolling back hacks or rolling back bad trades or freezing funds.
201
Yeah, it's interesting because I think Sui very much follows in the footsteps of Solana here, which is this embrace of the shifting overtime window around what, you know, what is an emerging ecosystem or an emerging L1 supposed to look like?
202
How it's supposed to behave, how muscular it's supposed to be, how much are they supposed to choose favorites and kind of be like the ethos of Ethereum back in 2015 is so unrecognizable from what emerging L1s look like today.
203
It's just like the wrong comparison to say, well, you know, what Ethereum was doing back then compared to what a new L1, a challenger L1, is expecting to behave like today.
204
The interesting thing, though, if you, if you rewind back to the history of Solana, even Solana in the heyday when Solana was getting criticized for being centralized, remember the, what was the bridge?
205
Wormhole hack.
206
The wormhole hack was in the billions.
207
And they were just like, yeah, we're just going to fill the hole.
208
You know, this was 200 million in a protocol that I think was worth more.
209
Like, Sui, I believe, is worth more than Solana was worth at the time that the wormhole hack took place.
210
And they were just like, well, you fill the hole.
211
The whole wormhole was filled by jump.
212
It wasn't filled by Solana blockchain.
213
It was filled by jump, although I would bet that there was a little more to that story than just stuff that people felt.
214
Yeah, yeah.
215
Well, I'll almost certainly wait that in the middle of the day.
216
Wait, wait, I thought they also.
217
Do you remember the jump lawsuit in the UK over the Oasis hacker where they were able to like there was like sort of some very weird censorship?
218
Yeah.
219
Somehow that's related to the wormhole hacker.
220
And like, I think like, I think they recovered some, like, I wish I, you know, this was the 2022 haze of FTX blowing up, so my memory is not like so great.
221
But there was like something related to the.
222
Yeah.
223
This whole episode is like four VCs who were super old.
224
Like China.
225
Yeah.
226
Well, it's shocking.
227
Remember that's China.
228
But so, okay, I guess the question is like the fact that this is, it really, it feels to me, I mean, I could be wrong, but it feels to me like this is a old versus young thing of how much people care about this.
229
Right.
230
For me, I'm like, this is the most interesting thing that happened this last week is the philosophical underpinnings of this conversation feel so different than what I remember them being, right?
231
Even with the BLAST hack, when that was, again, that was hypothetical.
232
They didn't actually have the time to go in and freeze the bridge to freeze the attacker.
233
And that was for an L2.
234
That wasn't even L1, right?
235
And that was like fucking, you know, it was a multi-sig.
236
So the whole argument about BLAST was like, well, it's a multi-sig anyway.
237
You might as well own the fact that it's centralized.
238
In this case, it's an L1.
239
It's supposed to be decentralized.
240
It's supposed to be a set of validators who are not able to just get together in a Zoom call and say, hey, let's freeze this guy right now.
241
Screw this person.
242
They were able to react very quickly to this hack.
243
And overwhelmingly, I'm just like, maybe I'm just out of touch.
244
Maybe like this sense that I have that these kind of decentralized, neutral, cypherpunk values, that I'm like, in a way, it's like probably important to get a gut check on that of like, am I just fucking totally lost in this conversation that like I think people think the way they did five years ago?
245
And if they don't at all, that's an important update to make as an investor is that, yeah, you should actually expect that there's a put on a major protocol from an emerging L1.
246
And that that will be true whether it's on Aptos, whether it's on Monad, whether it's on whatever, any new L1, you should expect that there's built-in insurance into the protocol.
247
Is that the world that we live in today?
248
And should we all just kind of assume that that's correct instead of walking around pretending that it's not?
249
You know what I mean?
250
Like the answer to this question is actually really important.
251
Part of it is like the expectation of better UX at a trade-off for decentralization.
252
I think fundamentally, people getting used to single sequencers and UX that resembles Web 2.
253
apps and inevitably means that people are willing to take more trade-offs than they were five to seven years ago.
254
And yeah, I guess the chopping boomers, you're like, you know, you're learning via podcasts that this might be true.
255
Yeah, I think this is something that's been in decline for a long time.
256
Even Ethereum, right, was like sacrilegious, or the idea of not running your own node or front-end or software.
257
And you get these sort of point-in-time reality checks.
258
And does it just sort of...
259
Do you remember when Eric Wall would be like, can I run an archive?
260
Every month he would write a Twitter thread of him trying to run an Ethereum archive?
261
I remember that.
262
I don't see anyone being like, oh no, I have to reload a proof-of-stake blockchain from a checkpoint.
263
I can't load from Genesis.
264
I don't see anyone complaining about that, for instance.
265
Yeah.
266
And so maybe that just really should inform the way you think about blockchains.
267
And maybe it should even inform the way that validators think about validating blockchains.
268
Is that like, hey, if there's a big hack, you kind of need to have the ability to do what Sweet just did.
269
Is this the beginning of the process under which it's not just that, hey, there's a big hack, it's that, hey, guys, new sanctions just dropped or law enforcement just hit up all the validators?
270
And in a world where there's more RWAs on chain, isn't this like inevitable?
271
But what we're talking about is that I agree, but I sort of think if RWA issue were you've written, you in fact have written this blog post a long time ago about Ethereum being unforkable effectively due to Oracles and RWAs.
272
And if their size is so much larger than the main chain, then they kind of control some of the censorship properties indirectly.
273
There's a lot of people I know who disagree with you, and I see you every once in a while fighting with someone on the internet about it.
274
But I think that there is a lot of truth to your post.
275
And I think arguably when the validators do this, they are more like that, right?
276
It's like closer to that in some ways.
277
And I think that's sad, but I think the nice thing about crypto is there's tons of chains, so you can go find a chain that is not that, if you want.
278
So it's like years 2030.
279
Like the DOJ has a direct line to every validator, Discord, and every single thing.
280
And the moment I see a bad hacker, boom, transaction just gets uploaded directly into their blacklist.
281
Pretty sure Doge cut the sounds getting frozen.
282
Doge cut the Discord account subscription, so they probably can't do that.
283
Well, speaking of the DOJ, do you see the judge vacated the Eisenberg mega markets thing?
284
Oh, yeah, that was crazy.
285
So maybe code is law, actually.
286
I mean, would they let it?
287
He's still in jail because of child city.
288
He's still in jail for CP.
289
Yeah.
290
Yeah.
291
I think it was just a procedural issue.
292
Yeah, there wasn't.
293
There was nothing about that case that was like, this is just such a nice person.
294
How could he be stuck in jail?
295
Did anyone read this sort of thing?
296
It was vacated because of jurisdiction, because he had no nexus in New York.
297
So they brought the case to New York, but he was in Puerto Rico.
298
He never stepped for it in New York, and they had some bullshit thing of like, oh, there are Ethereum nodes in New York.
299
Mango Markets.
300
It's in the cloud, and New York is in the cloud.
301
Yeah, exactly.
302
Something like that.
303
Something like that.
304
Anyway, okay.
305
Speaking of other ways in which we have fallen as an industry, last week we had Haseeb are you okay?
306
National Golf Jersey.
307
Haseeb, do we need to get you a therapist?
308
I am not doing what.
309
Like a decentralization therapist?
310
Please, please.
311
Who is a decentralization therapist for you?
312
Vitalik.
313
You and Vitalik need to go on a go-hike.
314
You go on the queue, though.
315
No, I need somebody with a softer touch than Vitalik.
316
Vitalik's a little bit of a vote for me.
317
Who do you think can lead you to the path of lightness?
318
I don't know, man.
319
You know what I need is I need a good Eric Voorhees, like just pep talk.
320
That's what I need.
321
Maybe we should get Eric Voorhees on next week and get him to talk about the crypto values and get all these youngsters to listen to what we grew up on instead of listening to fucking Ansom and meme coin hawkers.
322
Anyway, all right, so let's talk about the Trump youth.
323
Let's talk about the Trump dinner.
324
We've done a lot of dinner.
325
It's a little bit of dark there.
326
We got a limited schedule.
327
We've got to get through this.
328
All right.
329
Let's talk about the Trump dinner.
330
So, as you well know, people who hold the Trump token for long enough, for some period of time, they were invited to a Trump National Golf Club dinner.
331
This was for 220 top Trump token holders.
332
They met in D.C.
333
Trump arrived via Marine One, stayed for 20 minutes, gave a campaign and crypto speech.
334
Trump took a certain time.
335
Senator Elizabeth Warren called it an orgy of corruption, which, now, there's a lot of reporting about the actual dinner itself.
336
There were some protests going on outside.
337
It was very, very controversial, got a lot of attention from the media.
338
So this does feel like one of these moments that probably in the press is going to be coming back again and again: oh, Trump, the dinner, da-da-da-da, the meme coin.
339
So we had some people who were present at the dinner, including Justin Sun, of course, the number one holder, Kane, Sengro-O, If Guinea, who's been on the show, Matthew Leo, a bunch of other market maker types and Chinese investors and so on.
340
Apparently, the food was very bad.
341
They complained of like Walmart steak and like some freeze-dried mashed potatoes.
342
The pictures looked like it was like microwaved.
343
Yeah, they said, the food was trash, and the speech was, quote, unquote, bullshit.
344
So this does seem like vindication of what we were claiming, which is that Trump doesn't give a shit about any of these people.
345
And in a way, like the real story here is that Trump fucked over all these people.
346
But Justin Sun got his money's worth.
347
The number of articles I saw that were like, this crypto billionaire going to the Trump dinner, like he, he easily got his value in free PR from just like showing up and taking pictures.
348
And you know, Justin loves that.
349
So I'm not sure Justin was fucked over.
350
Does he need more PR?
351
I feel like no one's going to be like, oh, I've never heard of this.
352
Have you looked at it?
353
Did you look at his Twitter where he's like advertising this like Trump watch that he's like making?
354
Justin loves this shit.
355
There's no way he doesn't.
356
I did not see the Trump watch, but he bought a watch.
357
He bought a watch and Cufflin said.
358
Justin is all remember the Warren Buffett thing?
359
He like loves this type of thing.
360
I think this, Justin Sun probably got more utility out of this than anybody.
361
But nobody even spoke to Trump.
362
Like literally.
363
It doesn't matter.
364
Justin's got...
365
I literally saw the coverage, I agree.
366
Okay, he got a lot of people.
367
The coverage.
368
Every news agency had some mysterious crypto billionaire who was once thought to not be able to step foot in the U.S.
369
shows up to Trump dinner.
370
It does feel like you can't have it both ways.
371
It can't be both.
372
This is a vehicle for corruption, and Trump showed up and gave a speech and left.
373
If anything, this is actually the better outcome.
374
It would have been way worse if he had actually been giving people real FaceTime and this actually was a venue towards being able to whisper and sort of coerce the president.
375
But yeah, like you buy the token and he gives you a bad stake and leaves.
376
That just feels like he's got completely played.
377
It's a real corruption.
378
Yeah.
379
I think everyone sort of got what they wanted out of it, which is Trump is able to demonstrate to the crypto community that he cares, right?
380
Enough to do something like this.
381
I don't know that he demonstrated that he cares.
382
I mean, cares about what exactly?
383
Cares about the Trump token having some utility in some variety.
384
Okay.
385
Okay, fine.
386
I mean, Justin Sun creates his own utility.
387
Exactly.
388
And the crypto community that went there, I'm sure, clear-eyed and open-minded about what they were getting.
389
I don't think anyone there was expecting that they were going to smoke cigars with Trump and have a run at the golf after.
390
You want to bring back Evgeny next week and get an interview him?
391
I guarantee you that's what people were imagining.
392
Also, there was something about a White House tour, and that did not happen, clearly.
393
Well, that's because people complained about the food, and he just called it off.
394
Well, no, I think it's because it was fucking illegal because he's not allowed to profit from it.
395
Like, that was originally in the description is that they were going to do that, and then they were like, no, no, no, never mind.
396
We're not doing that.
397
We're going to give you a self-guided tour of the public part of the White House, which you can already go to.
398
You don't need anybody to give you permission to go there.
399
So, basically, he sort of realized that, like, hey, what I'm offering is very illegal, and obviously, a president cannot pan away from the office in that area.
400
Emoluments are sometimes too hard of a word to spell for a president.
401
So, I get it.
402
Yeah.
403
So, long story short, the dinner itself was kind of a nothing burger, literally, in that they were failed.
404
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
405
We should really get a guest to come on the show and walk us through the campaign.
406
I don't know that we want to spend more time on it.
407
I don't know that we want to spend more time on this.
408
Yeah, we all need it.
409
It's not that new story.
410
It's not really.
411
But it would be funny.
412
We're already getting blasted for the fact that every story we cover is already old news by the time it's on here.
413
Yeah, we're not the New York Times.
414
The chopping numbers.
415
The chopping the jumpers strikes again.
416
I think at this point, yeah, we might need to change up the game at this point.
417
But the thing is, the way in which this story has metamorphosed into the press, because I think we were calling this for a while, is that anybody who's buying the Trump token, actually thinking you're going to curry favor with the president, is probably out of your mind, right?
418
And the reality is, okay, yeah, this stuff Justin Sun, blah, blah, blah.
419
But Justin's son, first of all, he's bought multiple things from Trump.
420
He's bought Worldly Financial, and he's a single largest holder of Trump token.
421
And remember, Richard Hart's case was also dropped, which means it's not even clear he needed to do anything.
422
Maybe he just would have just.
423
Clearly, that he's all gotten through, very legitimate means.
424
And I think the real story here, which is not the story that the press has picked up on, the story the press has picked up on is, okay, this is this orgy of corruption.
425
And I agree, it looks like that.
426
The reality is that it's even worse, which is that there's no corruption here.
427
The corruption is somewhere else.
428
The corruption is not accessible to the people who buy Trump token.
429
Like the people who buy Trump token are the idiots who are getting played.
430
And the real people who are playing in the corruption, there are grown-up channels for that.
431
It's not buying new coins.
432
It's a new Air Force One that costs hundreds of millions of dollars.
433
Right.
434
Exactly.
435
Exactly.
436
So that, anyway, all right.
437
I think that's as far as we're going to get on this Trump dinner story, but expect this to come back.
438
There's probably going to be a lot more here.
439
And my guess is that there will also be more stuff happening with Trump Token.
440
Somehow, Trump Token still seems to be holding on to quite a lot of its value, even though this seemed like the central thing.
441
I can't imagine there's going to be another one of these dinners after everybody was so disappointed by the first.
442
The other thing that was really funny about this is that there was a lot of stories of people who were present who, I think, Tom, you had mentioned this before, were fully hedged.
443
So they were holding the spot Trump token, and they shorted the futures.
444
And as a result, they had no Delta exposure to Trump token.
445
And so they ended up coming for the grand total of like a couple thousand dollars in hedging costs or something like that.
446
So relatively cheap way to get a crappy dinner with the at present with the president.
447
Yeah, none of us went.
448
None of us went, unfortunately.
449
Okay.
450
So moving on to other news.
451
Actually, last week about Coinbase, but it's kind of still ongoing as people are pulling at the threads.
452
So story about Coinbase.
453
Brian Armstrong came out with a video saying that Coinbase had been basically held ransom.
454
And what was this ransom?
455
There were attackers who said, we have access to a bunch of customer data on Coinbase.
456
If you do not pay us this big, juicy ransom, I believe it was on the order of $20 million, we are going to release this data into the internet.
457
And Coinbase said, okay, you know what?
458
Screw you.
459
We are going to disclose that this thing happened, and we are going to instead offer a counter, instead of paying the ransom, we're going to offer a bounty of $20 million to any information that can lead to the arrest and capture of these hackers.
460
Okay, so the whole thing was immediately greeted with a lot of huzzah and like, oh my God, you know, Coinbase is so brave.
461
What an amazing counterplay.
462
But as more and more data has come to light about what really happened, there's been more raised eyebrows about this whole Coinbase insider breach.
463
So the claim was that less than 1% of users overall were affected.
464
No passwords, private keys, or funds were exposed.
465
This is purely a kind of data, KYC data, as well as customer data, like metadata leak.
466
So basically, they were able to bribe customer service agents, which I believe are mostly in India, and get access to their control panel, look up the accounts of people, and just kind of mess with them, especially when you get these calls that are like, hey, I'm a customer support agent at Coinbase.
467
That's very likely what a lot of these things were pulling on from when they were able to access insider data.
468
Actually, can I ask a dumb question?
469
People were posting all these pictures of Raj, one of the co-founders of Solana's KRC documents.
470
Was that from this leak?
471
No, no, no.
472
No, that just happened.
473
I mean, it's possible that the Coinbase.
474
I believe it was confirmed there was a different hack.
475
I believe it was confirmed there was a different hack.
476
Like some rapper's Instagram got hacked.
477
Migos.
478
Yeah.
479
Yeah.
480
They hacked Migos' Instagram, I guess, to broaden visibility.
481
Because this data is already on the dark web, right?
482
So presumably this is already out there.
483
So, you know, re-ransoming somebody, there would be no point in doing that.
484
So apparently, there was a phishing spike that happened a long time ago.
485
At least $46 million was stolen in March.
486
This hack supposedly was discovered a couple weeks ago, but apparently, in one of the disclosures that was given, I believe in the state of Maine, which in the state of Maine, you have to publicly file some information about a breach.
487
And when you do that, you have to show when the breach began.
488
Apparently, the breach began in December of last year is when this quote-unquote breach began.
489
And it was only very recently that this data actually, or this breach was disclosed to the public, or supposedly that Coinbase discovered it.
490
However, there's at least some insinuation that maybe this was not true because Coinbase recently changed the terms of service such that there's changes in the way that arbitration works and that class actions are no longer allowed.
491
So there's all these question marks about, hey, did Coinbase know about this for longer than they claimed?
492
And there's claims also from Seal and from some of the white hats that have been working with this that they knew that this had been going on for quite a while.
493
That there were a lot of script kitties who had been dropping screenshots and showing, demonstrating on the dark web that they had access to insider information at Coinbase.
494
They had access to customer service panels, and they were able to go in and systematically call up Coinbase customers and demand, basically try to do some kind of social engineering to get them to give up information.
495
So now, to be clear, all this is insinuation.
496
Nothing is totally proven at this point, but there is proof that on January 11th, Coinbase fired 300-plus support staff at one of their customer service support sites in, I think it was India, and rotated to a new site, presumably because of something like this, of some kind of systematic stealing/slash bribery, slash something, something else going on.
497
So, a lot of the conversation about this has been around the regime of a KYC to begin with.
498
Because the reason why this is all a problem is because of the fact that companies like Coinbase, obviously, Coinbase is not the only one.
499
To be clear, this happened many, many times in the past, but Coinbase is particularly vulnerable because of the nature of crypto custody.
500
But it's the nature of KYC in particular: our KYC regime requires every single financial counterparty that you have to own your KYC data.
501
And every single financial counterparty has that data duplicated.
502
It doesn't live in one repository, and everybody asks for it when they need to look at it.
503
Literally, everybody needs to have their own copy of your data.
504
And so, if any actor, whether it's a credit bureau, as it's happened many times before, or you know, a bank or any financial institution or Coinbase, every single one of them has your financial data and has your KYC data.
505
And any single one of them, if they get popped, then that data is going back out there into the wild and into the hands of hackers.
506
So, we're now in a situation where many of the most high-profile victims have their data out there swirling among attackers.
507
What are you guys' thoughts on this story?
508
It seems like, for the most part, Wall Street was kind of ignoring it, and then it kind of thought, hey, maybe this is more serious than we thought.
509
I don't know where things landed.
510
I've been a little bit out of the loop.
511
But Robert, why don't we get your quick reaction to this Coinbase hack story?
512
Yeah, so the hack is unfortunate because there's a lot of risk that has been put onto the users of Coinbase unnecessarily, right?
513
There's been a huge increase in phishing and attack outreach to Coinbase customers.
514
Whether or not people lose money, the annoyance and the threat has gone up to pretty much every single user impacted in this league.
515
So the cost is not just what's already been stolen.
516
The cost is they've hoisted attackers onto a huge portion of their user base.
517
And the information that's out there, it's not just KYC information, it was also Coinbase information.
518
It was your trading history, it was your deposits and withdrawals, right?
519
The users that were compromised in this, you know, sophisticated attackers could sort rank them by how much money they have and where they live, right?
520
Like really scary stuff.
521
Like the physical threat that's been created by this is significant.
522
Almost guaranteedly, someone is going to get killed over this, right?
523
If they haven't already.
524
It was funny that it happened the same week as someone was kidnapped and tortured in New York over the over crypto.
525
Yeah.
526
I mean, that was an Italian tourist, you know.
527
No, no, yeah.
528
I know it was totally different, but my point is, like, it was crazy how the timing was like almost the same day.
529
So I think the real harm of this is actually incredibly high.
530
And I think it's a really, really, really unfortunate event to have occurred.
531
And so much of Coinbase's value comes at the end of the day from trust, right?
532
That they're not going to lose stuff that they're supposed to hold, right?
533
The incredibly important information about their customers is it's bad, right?
534
As a user, it makes me feel really, really, really unhappy and really uncomfortable.
535
So, you know, I think they've handled the crisis comms well, but the fact that this happened in the first place is completely embarrassing.
536
It's bad.
537
Do you think there's like an alternative, alternative regime that we should be contemplating here?
538
Or like, how do you, I just want to stop this besides, okay, Hasib, have you not heard of our Lord and Savior world coin?
539
I'm familiar with it, but that is not going to work for everybody.
540
I'm just kidding.
541
I'm just kidding.
542
But there is some irony that blockchains are built around, like in theory, could be private and do a lot of this stuff.
543
But yet, 99% of users of tokens lose their KYC docs.
544
Yeah, I agree that the KYC complex that's been created over decades of slow evolution sucks, right?
545
It doesn't actually protect people.
546
At this point, it jeopardizes people probably more than it helps them, right?
547
There's now a surface area where hundreds of companies all have to protect your personal information and they're not really in the business of IT security.
548
Yeah, Italian security is the weakest among all the companies you use.
549
And any company can join this fray of like being required through a whole variety of reasons, required to take everyone's personal data and hope that they can do a good job keeping it.
550
And like, if Coinbase can't do it, why do you think that everyone else in the supply chain can, right?
551
And so, you know, I do think it requires a bigger conversation about what's the point of all this anyway and like what's actually being achieved and when do the costs outweigh the benefits?
552
I'm trying to remember.
553
There actually was once an even crazier story that was like this, whereas I forget who it was, Chinese or North Korea.
554
So then they then really act.
555
They were like a third-party consultant, and they did this for like small to medium-sized crypto exchanges who didn't want to do their own.
556
That's crazy.
557
And that was like how a bunch of keys were stolen from small exchanges.
558
This was a while ago, but all I'm saying is, yeah, the KYC stuff is, it has like, it's the most attackable system ever.
559
And it's even more attackable with generative AI now.
560
Like, what I literally can be like, hey, make me a passport photo from this, you know, from this picture.
561
And like, yeah, so I feel like the KYC regime, I don't know how it breaks.
562
I guess maybe what are your predictions on like what happens to it in five years?
563
Because clearly it's like fraying at the seams right now.
564
I mean, my prediction is that nothing changes and things just keep getting worse.
565
Like, I don't give a lot of credit.
566
Thank you, Dr.
567
Doom, for seeing problems.
568
It's just, I mean, it's been just 20 plus years of it just being like this.
569
And I don't think the acceleration, like, there may be like, okay, more and more passports are scannable, right?
570
And they're purely digital, and you can get some kind of the cryptographic, the chip, the RFC chip.
571
You can just, you know, use your NFC scanner and just be like, okay, cool, do this instead of actually sending us a photo of your passport.
572
That clearly is going away, especially with generative AI.
573
That's just trivial now to generate anything.
574
So any kind of eyeballing it as the symbol resistance.
575
World coin.
576
No, World's Coin.
577
We're not showing World's Coin.
578
I think the answer is that nothing changes for a really, really long time until it gets unbearably bad.
579
And it's not a bad thing.
580
But I think unbearably bad is like next year.
581
I don't think it's next year.
582
Or now.
583
We might already be unbearably bad.
584
This is definitely not unbearably bad.
585
If you're not getting senators, then it's not unbearably bad.
586
Well, I agree with Tarun that very quickly people will start stealing the identity of senators and stuff using AI, right?
587
Like you can generate almost anything you want at this point.
588
There's enough models out there that I agree.
589
And I think that means that the security systems for these companies will adapt, but the laws will not adapt.
590
The laws will not change for a long, long time until senators start getting their money stolen.
591
Wow, that's a long arc of lobbying.
592
Like you make an entity that purposely tries to steal a sender's identity to prove a point that they need to write a law.
593
Hold on, I just do that.
594
I do not, that is Tarun advocating that.
595
I said nothing of the sort.
596
I think that was the implication I got from the implication.
597
The implication, you say.
598
Yeah, but I actually don't think that'll work because my hunch would be if a senator gets their identity stolen, they're going to blame the institution that leaked their data.
599
They're not going to say the KYC in general is broken.
600
They're going to say, Bank of America sucks.
601
How could you?
602
Very hard to remove rules in a democracy.
603
It's kind of the way it works.
604
Tom, what's your take?
605
Yeah, I tend to agree.
606
I mean, I do think hopefully we'll move to a system that relies more on cryptography means of verifying identity soon, not a WorldCoin shell, more any document to use.
607
I mean, there's like even ZK passport stuff today, but I agree, like, that is really interesting.
608
WorldCoin does have a ZK passport.
609
No, all right.
610
This episode is sponsored by Super Time.
611
This episode is sponsored by a company that none of the four of us invested in.
612
Hey, not too late, not too late.
613
We'll take some free WorldCoin tokens, though.
614
I want Red Bulls, not World Coins.
615
Come on.
616
Yeah, it's true.
617
Yeah.
618
Maybe it worked.
619
We are formerly, the show is formerly sponsored by Red Bull.
620
Maybe someday again.
621
We just need to mention like F1 more or something.
622
Then maybe we'll get Red Bull sponsors back.
623
I don't know if I can't.
624
The chopping F1 block.
625
Okay.
626
All right.
627
Well, that was a little strange.
628
All right.
629
We're flagging here.
630
We're flagging here.
631
We got one more.
632
Okay, wait, wait.
633
We got to talk before.
634
I know we got a hard limit, so we got to talk about the most important topic of the week, which is James Wynn.
635
James Wynn.
636
Yes.
637
Oh, yes.
638
Finally.
639
I am not.
640
All right.
641
Okay.
642
I've got a little write-up here.
643
I have not been following the story very closely, so I guess I'll just...
644
Robert, you guys.
645
Has he?
646
Okay, James Wynn, UK-born trader.
647
He got $6,000 in ETH from Alameda in 2020.
648
He became an icon for his training in Pepe, later accused of some pump and dumps and random meme coin tokens.
649
In March 2025, he shifted over to hyperliquid, deposited $6 million, and began high-leverage trading, trading with as much as 40x leverage.
650
His peak PL, he reached $87 million in profit, has paid over $2 million in fees.
651
In May of 2024, or sorry, in May of 2025, he opened a $1.25 billion long position on Hyperliquid, lost a very small amount, $13 million after Trump's tariff shock, and then shorted BTC with another absolutely massive billion-dollar position.
652
Right now, his cumulative P<unk>L has dropped to minus $13 million net after some losses.
653
Hasin' you found $13.
654
Haseeb, you're still positive.
655
Hasid, your YouTube crypto trader arc is coming through, the way you read that.
656
You were like, you had another.
657
In total, he's up $9 million.
658
In total, he's up $9 million.
659
Okay, so he's a notional.
660
This is great.
661
This is current information.
662
Yeah.
663
That's crazy.
664
Okay.
665
So, I'm sorry, $13 million net.
666
Nine.
667
It's nine now.
668
Current position.
669
Nine.
670
It's nine now.
671
Okay.
672
Got it.
673
So this guy is just moving markets.
674
He's totally insane.
675
He is captivating the world.
676
Reminds me a little bit of the polymarket trader.
677
I mean, my favorite folks in the P<unk>L.
678
My favorite thing about him is that Suzu was like, this guy is irresponsible and taking too much long.
679
Yes, when Suzu is calling you out publicly for taking too much risk in your trading, okay, you know that you have gone too far.
680
For Suzu to do this, Suzu is probably one of the most risk-seeking traders of all time.
681
He blew up three AEC and lost billions of dollars of other people's money that was fraudulently borrowed slash traded away.
682
For Suzu to call you out and say you're too risky, this guy needs to look in the mirror and listen because that is something.
683
But to Haseib's summary, which is phenomenal, the part that you missed was the Moonpig showing.
684
So he's also the creator of some stupid meme coin called Moonpig.
685
And a lot of people believe that this is simply a marketing exercise for Moonpig.
686
What?
687
How could this be a marketing exercise?
688
Because all he does is tweet about it.
689
All he does is tweet about Moonpig.
690
And so one of the many sort of like half-joking conspiracy theories about this guy is that either A, he is one of the former FTX employees, B, this is actually not trading losses or gains at all, that he's using a mirror account that takes the opposite side of every one of the trades.
691
And there was a really interesting tweet today by, I think it was like the look on chain accounts or something like that that was like, look, we found an account that's like the exact mirror opposite of him.
692
And interesting, interesting.
693
And third, it's that, you know, he's whatever he's making or losing, he's making more on the Moonpig meme coin that he owns a crazy amount of that he's, you know, how big is Moonpig?
694
Good question.
695
Let's look it up.
696
I bet you this is going to be like the lowest market cap coin we've ever talked about on the show.
697
Moonpig?
698
Market cap is 64 million.
699
It's not, you know, that's in the lowest.
700
That's in the range of lowest market cap.
701
It is.
702
I mean, trades 29 million a day.
703
That's not nothing.
704
Right.
705
It's not much, but.
706
So the guy is crazy.
707
On the classic chopping block, hinged to unhinged scale.
708
He is very far out on the unhinged side.
709
Okay.
710
What if it turns out that the mirror account actually is his?
711
Does that change your yeah, then he's more hinged.
712
Actually, then he starts to get into like just rational and cumulative, you know, manipulative tier.
713
Yeah.
714
Yeah.
715
I mean, this mirror account idea is fascinating because it is a very, very capital-intensive way to run a marketing campaign, which is usually not the forte of meme coin boosters, is that they have a lot of money with which to run it.
716
But the beauty of having a public order book in the sense that it's on hyperliquid, you can see everything, is that that becomes the marketing.
717
In fact, Suzu was one of the first, I feel like, in 2020 to really take advantage of this, where like you would just publicly buy a ton of stuff on Suzu.eth, and you just see this trail of people copying all the time, right?
718
And so I think there is some truth to this social trading thing kind of working as well as.
719
Becoming the single bat signal for crypto Twitter, that is powerful.
720
But you can't just buy, you can't just launch a short Bitcoin.
721
You have to actually do something with it besides be like the man of one token, right?
722
If you're just like, okay, moon pig all day long, fine.
723
But if you're like, no, no, no, virtuals, this week is virtuals, and you buy virtuals and you front run your own.
724
That would make sense as a way to monetize becoming the anointed one and having everybody paying attention to your account.
725
But that doesn't seem like what he's doing.
726
That's normally what I see when somebody becomes the main character.
727
You're Suzu, you're Ansom, you're whoever that everybody's copy trading.
728
That's how you monetize that, is by making calls and being early and getting out early.
729
Well, everyone I know is following James Wynn, right?
730
I mean, he doubled his follower account from like $100,000 to $200,000 a day.
731
Right, because for multiple reasons, right?
732
Everyone's following him for different reasons.
733
One is entertainment.
734
It's insane to watch somebody.
735
That's me.
736
Yeah.
737
Like somebody trading a billion dollars against like 20 million of equity is insane, right?
738
Maximum absolute leverage.
739
The second is the, I'm worried about hyperliquid/slash blow-up risk, right?
740
Hyperliquid has been changing its rules of the platform to start to reduce margin as a function of size because he's basically found a loophole in the risk management algorithm, right?
741
And lastly, it's the people that are interested in how he moves markets.
742
I mean, he's literally buying or selling a billion dollars of Bitcoin publicly, pretty often at this point.
743
And, you know, there's a lot of people trying to trade around him as someone who doesn't care about slippage.
744
And he's just like going long or shorter, you harder Bitcoin every time he feels like it is wild.
745
And so, you know, he's picked up a huge amount of visibility.
746
A lot of people have rooted for him to blow up.
747
A lot of people are rooting for him to make $100 million.
748
I just can't.
749
What are you guys rooting for him to do?
750
I'm rooting for him to demonstrate the failure of risk controls of an exchange that lets you trade a billion dollars.
751
You want him to basically blow up hyperliquid.
752
Not to blow up hyperliquid.
753
No, no, no, no.
754
But for everyone to learn from this, right?
755
Like, I actually hope it leads to lessons for all of the analysts to say, like, okay, this is where the risk controls were inadequate, and this is how to improve them, not just for Hyperliquid, but for the ecosystem at large.
756
This guy's Trump.
757
He is a stress test.
758
Dr.
759
What are you rooting for?
760
I'm long entertainment.
761
And like, this guy is like, this is a good thing.
762
So what's the most entertaining outcome?
763
Is the question.
764
I think an HLP blow-up that then somehow gets covered by hype getting like, you know, like some type of, some type of like, some part of the system on Bitcoin, right?
765
If he's just doing Bitcoin, is HLP on the other side of Bitcoin?
766
Not in sufficient size, yeah.
767
But I meant, I meant, you asked what outcome.
768
I'm just saying.
769
I'm just, yeah, it would be funny if like HLP kind of blew up because, like, the HLP liquidator vault actually is way smaller than the overall HLP vault, and that might not be sufficient size.
770
I think it was like 8 million or something.
771
So, like, it could be hard.
772
Although, there's a lot of people, I mean, at the end of the day, it's like, there's like, what's the equity shortfall that could occur?
773
How much demand is there to buy or sell around?
774
This guy, he was partially liquidated last night, like, also, like, FYI.
775
He was partially liquidated.
776
Like, literally, the price hit his actual liquidation price by like a millimeter, right?
777
And he was partially liquidated, and the market handled it quite well.
778
I think it would just be funny to see another version of this, but then also basically see a decentralized exchange recover from such a thing very quickly.
779
Because, like, in centralized exchange lands, you've definitely had this thing where like users have figured out how to manipulate the liquidation engine.
780
FTX, obviously, being very famous for the mobile coin incident, amongst others.
781
But this has happened in multiple exchanges.
782
And how they recover from that is like a sign of how windy the exchange is, in my opinion.
783
And I think if hyperliquid can prove they can recover from that, then it's like it has cemented its position for a long time.
784
Fair enough.
785
Tom, what are you rooting for?
786
I just love to watch a man lose $80 million on a Monday night, you know?
787
But that's entertaining.
788
It's true.
789
He wants him to lose.
790
If he made 80 mil too, it would be great, but we just, we just love the thrill of it.
791
Any giant winner, giant losses.
792
Yeah, it has to just be big.
793
That's all it matters.
794
All right, fine.
795
I'm hoping that we don't have to keep talking about this for multiple weeks because I think the thing that I'm getting tired of is these recurring stories that we come back to week over week.
796
But we'll see.
797
He might be.
798
I hope James Wynn stays the story for me.
799
You hope he stays the story?
800
All right, fine.
801
Yeah, okay.
802
We gotta wrap.
803
Thanks, everybody.
804
We'll be back next week.
805
See you all.
806
That's good.
807
See ya.
