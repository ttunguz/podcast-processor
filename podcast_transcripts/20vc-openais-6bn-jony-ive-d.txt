1
The wars that you choose to engage in dictate what it has to take to win.
2
We have to let go of this vision that venture has to involve fund returners.
3
The only way the math works is if you stuff money into the very best company and you don't end up with a balanced portfolio.
4
You end up literally with one company having 20, 30% of your fund in it, and that company turns out to be the big winner.
5
I think your absolute assumption has to be YC has won.
6
It's the greatest, one of the greatest equity businesses ever.
7
This is 20 VC with me, Harry Stebbings.
8
Now, it is my favorite show of the week, the news roundup with me, Jason Lemkin, and Rory O'Driscoll.
9
Today, we discuss Insights Two Deals, the winner, the loser, Hinge, and Builder.
10
We discuss the IPOs of Mountain and Hinge.
11
What happens to the Chime IPO investors and the later stage investors?
12
Who wins, who loses?
13
Will Elon become the first half-trillionaire?
14
And so much more.
15
Also, Johnny Ive joining OpenAI part-time, the discussion there.
16
This was so much fun to do.
17
I want your feedback on these shows.
18
Let me know, Harry, at 20vc.com.
19
I'd love to hear your thoughts.
20
But before we dive in today, here are two fun facts about our newest brand sponsor, Kajabi.
21
First, their customers just crossed a collective $8 billion in total revenue.
22
Wow.

As an investor, I'm always on the lookout for tools that really transform how I work.
29
Tools that don't just save time, but fundamentally change how I uncover insights.
30
That's exactly what AlphaSense does.
31
With the acquisition of Tegas, AlphaSense is now the ultimate research platform built for professionals who need insights they can trust fast.
32
I've used Tegas before for company deep dives right here on the podcast.

43
What comes to mind when you think about business banking?
44
Probably not speed, ease, or growth.
45
I'm willing to bet that's because you're not using Mercury.
46
With Mercury, you can quickly send wires and paid bills, get access to credit sooner, to hit the ground running faster.
47
I speak to dozens of founders every week, and most of them are using Mercury because they're super smart, and that's what you have to be using.
48
Visit mercury.com to experience it for yourself.
49
Mercury is a financial technology company, not a bank.
50
Banking services provided by Choice Financial Group, Column NA, and Evolve Bank and Trust, members of FDIC.
51
You have now arrived at your destination.
52
Team, I am so excited for this.
53
I love this show.
54
It is that time again.
55
We're going to dive right in to two Insight deals: a winner and a loser.
56
Happens in this game.
57
And Insight had both Builder AI, which raised 500 million, I think it was across rounds, shuts down false projections.
58
I read about they were projecting 200 and they actually got 45 million in revenue.
59
Let's start there.
60
Losing $500 million is a lot.
61
It's over a $100 million hole for Insight.
62
I'm sure more.
63
How did we analyze this one?
64
Because this was a big hole.
65
At first, I read it and I was shocked.
66
You know, it's pretty, it almost seemed like fraud losing $500 million on an AI website builder, right?
67
But then when I read it, it's SVV shut, or whoever held the debt, shut them down because they missed their projections, is what I read happen.
68
That's interesting.
69
Like, Rory, when is that okay?
70
Have you ever had a portfolio company or done an investment where the founders were more aggressive on their projections than the numbers they actually hit?
71
Have you seen that in your story career as a VC?
72
I'm shocked to discover that not every plan happens and not every company has 100% attainment of plan.
73
But let's start with, you know, from Insight's perspective, $100 million, I think the last fund is $12, but it's approximately 1% of the fund.
74
No one likes losing $100 million.
75
Money is money.
76
But in the context of the game they're playing.
77
Does it matter?
78
Is anyone getting fired for this honestly?
79
Stepping back.
80
Does it matter?
81
Of course it matters.
82
Should you get fired?
83
Is the first question.
84
If you do deals, you make investments.
85
If your unit of account is $100 million, which is an impossibly large amount to any of us on this call, still less any of your listeners, but it's just the nature of the checks you write.
86
If you have a plus or minus $10 billion fund, you write $100 million checks.
87
Some of those $100 million checks don't work out.
88
You lose the money.
89
If you lose more than you win, you get fired.
90
The good news is, I think Jeff Horing himself, the founder, was involved, who's made SCADS of money.
91
I think he was a big investor, an early investor in Wiz.
92
I don't think Jeff is going to lose his job for dropping $100 million when he's returned a couple of billion dollars somewhere else.
93
They'll all be just fine.
94
So I'm not spending any time worrying about whether or not Insight will be just fine despite this loss.
95
On the flip side, though, they had Hinge five exits of money, return $400 million.
96
Great win.
97
It is in a $6.2 billion fund.
98
My take on that was like, is that just the nature of the game they're playing?
99
They're never going to have fund returners by nature of it.
100
Or is that just actually a pretty immaterial exit, as awful as it sounds?
101
I think it's the former.
102
We have to let go of this vision that venture has to involve fund returners.
103
I think as the fund size gets larger, the kind of bets that investors make are, you have more bets and a more later stage.
104
I think the probability of any one deal return, quote unquote, returning the fund goes way down.
105
It's not impossible at any level, but at seed, it's almost a necessity.
106
And I defer to you guys on that.
107
You have a better feel for it.
108
But, you know, for example, our model is: we figure we do 20 deals, 30% are bad, 50% are solid and return one to 5x, and 20% for companies return more than 5x with an average of 10, which by definition means about a 0.5x the fund.
109
We've had fund returners, but our mental model is we have to get four of them right, each of them good enough to return half the fund, and therefore you get 2x from your big winners, another one and a half x from your base hits, and there you are.
110
That's a model at our stage.
111
Now, you go to a $6 billion, $8 billion fund, you know, 10x our size, you're probably looking at some kind of model like that.
112
If you're doing roughly equal-sized bets, it just gets harder and harder to assume that a single deal is going to transform the whole fund.
113
So you're left with this dynamic of having to, as you say, make $500 million, have a happy day, and then say to yourself, we're 10% of the way there.
114
Roy, when you look at the historical data, where has your predictions of that value dispersion, where have they been off?
115
Have you had more losses and more higher upside returns?
116
Where has it been off in historical data?
117
It's been pretty accurate overall, but what you'll internalize, and this is where all venture is the same, is if you think about the degrees of freedom there, if you take it, you actually have your six numbers.
118
You have the percentage in each bucket and you have the value of each bucket.
119
The biggest single variable that can influence things is the return in the best deals, right?
120
In other words, that's the thing that can kind of, quote, save you to the upside, right?
121
If you have 30% in losses and you get a 0.5x back in those deals, it doesn't matter much if it's a 0.2 or a 0.8.
122
It just doesn't move the needle enough.
123
By definition, the number of deals in the middle bucket are middling.
124
And so by definition, the middling number can never change anything.
125
So really, the only thing that counts is you have to.
126
I remember a venture guy I knew who's been in this business a long time basically said, you have to have a model something like I just articulated, he said.
127
And then every three funds, something utterly amazing happens that you can't really forecast.
128
And instead of that winner being a 10X or a 15X, you get that 120 or 40 or 50x, and that fund's just amazing.
129
And then, of course, it's a fatal error to assume you're going to do that every time because it's just not likely.
130
But that's kind of mentally how you think of the model.
131
Tying it back to the beginning of conversation, they owned Insight on 43% of Monday when it IPO's.
132
Yes.
133
So today, I hope they get more, right?
134
That's harder today to collect 43% of the next Monday, right?
135
What you're wrestling with here for these large funds, you're absolutely right, Jay.
136
You can run the math, and then you do what the stuff that Josh Koppelman did and said, how likely is it that there are enough exits at that size and stage to allow you to achieve your objective?
137
And when you run that math, you realize, hmm, I need six $10 billion exits in a year, let's just say.
138
And on average, there's only four a year.
139
The math doesn't work, especially if multiple people are doing it.
140
So, what you end up with is the very tippy-top of the tail only works where instead of having 20 equal-sized bets, the only way the math works is if you stuff money into the very best company and you don't end up with a balanced portfolio, you end up literally with one company having 20, 30% of your fund in it, and that company turns out to be the big winner, right?
141
Because there just aren't enough big winners.
142
That's why, as I said, you look at Founders Fund and stuff all the money you can in Anderal, because it's the only way to deploy that capital.
143
Brian Singerman.
144
It's especially true at scale.
145
It's not Jason's enemy.
146
It's not your enemy.
147
Because the truth is, at your stage, you probably don't know enough to have the certainty to put 30% of the fund in one deal.
148
Because let's be honest, at seed, you know Jack.
149
And this is why the game has changed.
150
When you have staying private for longer, the correct way to play the late-stage game is very different than the correct way to play the earlier seed and even A and B where we play game.
151
And that's why, going right back to it, these mental rules of thumb that we have on, oh, X deal has to return the fund are wrong and irrelevant for the game those guys are playing.
152
What they have to do is return that $8 billion in paltry $500 million chunks and make damn sure that there's one deal where they have 20% of the fund invested in it and that gets, you know, two or three billion back.
153
That's the mission.
154
It's a different business.
155
One number that everyone is so focused on, especially founders, they are just so fixated on, and I think a little bit is the Twitter sphere, is the speed to 100 million.
156
We have your macaws and we have your lovables and your bolts and your, ooh, in the race to 100 million an error.
157
And it's this AI wave that is so focused on it.
158
As investors today, how much weight do you put on the speed of time to get to 100 million era or X number AR?
159
You'd be an idiot not to wait at some level, because, you know, we're all traction junkies.
160
Once you move beyond seed, traction is the best proxy for the overall commercial success.
161
But you'd also be an idiot to wait at 100%.
162
It's an interesting qualifying proxy, but it's by no means this positive.
163
It is the kind of boring.
164
My worry today, when I think about that, it'd be nice to say, listen, those are all great examples, guys, but like a company that grows at a great rate, but a saner rate, that is less dilutive and has a bigger moat is a better bet, or just as good a bet.
165
We'd like to think that, right?
166
And maybe it's true, but what I worry about are two things in today's world: are access to talent and access to capital.
167
And there is just, listen, talent has always been a moth to flames with the hottest startups, right?
168
But AI has just amped it up.
169
It has just amped it up.
170
And every smart engineer, every smart kid wants to work at the hottest AI company.
171
They don't even want to work at the best B2B company.
172
They don't even want to work at Dipling or Real, okay?
173
They want to work at OpenAI or Windsurf.
174
And they're just going to say something in their defense.
175
They're right.
176
Wouldn't you?
177
The best advice you can give someone starting out in career is join an amazing company that's going to be at the forefront of things for the next five or 10 years so you can kind of be there, be there at the start, build the connections, build the knowledge.
178
It's not like the kids these days are bad.
179
They're entirely rational in planning their career.
180
Join the wave.
181
Because look, because that wave is going to last them the next 30 years in much the same way, you know, you started out in SaaS.
182
If you think back, starting out in SaaS in 2000, 2000 or whatever, four or five, great call.
183
Gives you a 20-year horizon.
184
Especially in engineering, the smartest people have always wanted to work on the most interesting problems, right?
185
And the most interesting problems...
186
So the problem with the plotting pace, which I would like, is it's hard enough to compete with Real and Dipling, okay, for talent.
187
Because listen, all the best sales talent I know wants to work at Rippling.
188
Half of my old team works there.
189
So you're already competing with Rippling, but poor Rippling's competing with Windsurf and Cursor and Granola and Chinola.
190
And then access to capital, which is, I don't think, 80% of the B2B VCs, like we've talked about, want to touch something that doesn't have a chance at hypergrowth.
191
So if you're not in that category, the math looks great, but you better have your own little ecosystem where you can thrive, your own little world where you can recruit, and you don't need as much capital.
192
And you better be copacetic about it and have a strategy there, right?
193
Agreed.
194
Thank you, Jason, for bringing it quite right to where you started, which was this $100 million, is it meaningful?
195
And I think the answer we're both saying is yes, it's meaningful.
196
It's just a proxy for and a magnet for success.
197
It's not perfect because there will be churn.
198
$100 million with low churn, that's very bloody meaningful.
199
Yeah, but maybe better to be in London.
200
It still shocks me at the employee churn rate at OpenAI.
201
I can't believe how many people leave.
202
You're leaving so much money on the table to go to another AI startup.
203
I mean, you're leaving the, it's not like they have the highest employee retention on planet.
204
I don't know who did it, but that was quite interesting information on the anthropic retention rate being significantly higher than the open AI retention rate.
205
That was just an interesting piece of data.
206
And maybe it speaks to why those investors are taking that dilution.
207
I mean, if you want to, look, because whenever, going back to the comment on dilution, whenever I'm on a board on a comp committee and we start talking about, oh my God, the dilution is too high or too low, what I always say, I want to see two other pieces of data.
208
I want to see attrition.
209
Are we losing people?
210
And I want to see close rate on offers.
211
Are we failing to hire people?
212
Because in the end, forget morality, it's a marketplace out there.
213
If you're losing people a lot, especially for economic reasons, if you're not able to attract the talent, then maybe dilution isn't high enough.
214
Conversely, if you're not losing people, you know, maybe we can manage dilution a little better.
215
In the anthropic open AI wars, I think they're doing what it takes to keep.
216
67% retention rate, employees after two years, 67% versus 80 for Anthropic.
217
Yeah, 80.
218
That's 67% is too much cash on the table.
219
Yeah.
220
Not everyone is as greedy as you are, Harry.
221
What can I tell you?
222
Sort of.
223
I don't know.
224
I mean, greed's complicated.
225
They may think that they're getting more.
226
Some of the problem is if you've been there two years in OpenAI and you made 8 million in tender offers, you might think another 8 is easy.
227
The mindset's complicated.
228
I do want to go back to the Hinge IPO because there was some stuff I was tracking a week ago we talked about and actually got a lot more clarity on in the last week.
229
I think it's super interesting.
230
And it a little bit goes to, yeah, Jason, some of the stuff you circulated about, you know, the state of the unicorns and where they are, right?
231
We've had two IPOs in the last week, Hinge Health and Mountain.
232
One of them a digital health company, Hinge Health, one of them a digital ad for cable TV company, right?
233
Solid businesses, two, $300 million revenue, decent growth rate, wonderful outcomes for the VCs involved, right?
234
And it kind of, and you take that and you take QIIME as well as being on file, it's kind of a proxy for, there's a couple of takeaways here.
235
One is there is an IPO market here right now, right?
236
And you don't have to be $5 billion.
237
Much of the stuff that people said, the comments about you have to be $500 million, which is, I think, a CO2 comment, the comment that the window was going to shut a month ago, both of them are wrong.
238
Deals are getting done right now in the last week that are wonderful outcomes for all concerns.
239
That's the first point, is that $2,300 million, it is no longer $100 million.
240
It's $200 or $300 million.
241
It's growth.
242
It's profitable or near-profitable.
243
But that's what it takes to get something done.
244
These are facts on the ground.
245
Mountain's growing as well, but not quite as aggressively.
246
But yes, solid growth.
247
You're exactly right.
248
And because holding that tall, Jason, it's actually terrifying how few of the unicorns are close to that level.
249
And we'll come back to that point.
250
But the other point that I was just now down in venture weeds, but it really matters.
251
I was trying to figure out is how do all those super high late-stage rounds get processed through the lens of the IPO?
252
In other words, does the last round have a block and therefore can stop a down round?
253
Do they not have a block?
254
Or was the last round low enough that it doesn't matter?
255
And we now have one of each in those three names.
256
Mountain, I don't think, had a prior round that had a block, and I don't think they had a prior round that made the IPO a down round.
257
Perfectly normal, boring IPO.
258
Hinge is really interesting.
259
They raised money at $6 billion in 2021.
260
That money clearly had a block.
261
Not that they could stop an IPO, but that they couldn't make that preferred convert to common as part of the IPO, which in my mindset, and it turns out to be wrong, meant that they could, quote, block an IPO.
262
So what happened?
263
If you look, there's a couple of investors.
264
And if you read the detail of the S1, it's very kind of dense.
265
But what you figure out is CO2, who clearly paid $6 billion for a company that's now gone public at between two and three, did some kind of negotiation.
266
They sold some shares back to the company.
267
They bought some common.
268
So they basically agreed to convert in return for kind of some kind of make-good.
269
So in other words, they were able to get around the block and come to some kind of economic deal.
270
Some of the other preferred investors in the last round didn't come to such an agreement.
271
I thought they could, quote, block the IPO, but it turns out they didn't.
272
The preferred simply stays in place.
273
That preferred.
274
And what this is, is the public market saying, hey, you guys want to go public.
275
You got this preferred on the balance sheet.
276
Normally we'd say clean up the whole balance sheet, but it's like, we're not going to say that here.
277
We're going to get this deal done.
278
The deal priced in the mid-30s, trades in the early 40s.
279
You've still got this stranded $200 million block of preferred that doesn't convert to common until $70 a share.
280
But that's their problem.
281
We don't give a shit.
282
Do they lose money then?
283
Yes, they haven't, quote, this is really funny.
284
They haven't quote lost money because they still have their theoretical, they don't have to convert from preferred to common until the preferred, well, they don't even have to prefer ever, but they don't have to convert until it's $70 a share.
285
So they didn't, quote, lose money, but they're sitting there in a non-interest-bearing instrument that's way out of the money, and the mark to market on that is now clear for all to see.
286
Congratulations, you have a preferred stock that's a 1x, and you don't make any return until the stock gets to 77, and it's now trading at 40.
287
What it does is it to some extent weakens the ability.
288
This is really significant.
289
It weakens the ability of those later rounds of preferred to block an IPO.
290
The market is working.
291
The public markets are saying, we can deal with a bit of noise.
292
We can price this.
293
It's just stuck up there and preferred.
294
And it's kind of a little isolated pile of capital that's clearly underwater because the common price isn't worth it.
295
So it's a 1x instrument.
296
And therefore, on a discounted mark-to-market basis, it's worth less than a 1x.
297
If you're them, you'd rather it was bought for $2 billion by someone else.
298
Absolutely.
299
If you get an MA, you get your money back.
300
But this is what I love about it.
301
And maybe they couldn't sell for $2,000, and maybe the other investors.
302
And what this does is it removes the ability of that late-stage, high-priced round to get in the way of everything.
303
You can't make them convert.
304
They still have their quote 1X, good for them.
305
But you, as the founding CEO, you as the early investors, can go into the public markets and go on, get your liquidity, get your 10X if you're the first one, get your 4X if it's InSight, whatever it takes, and get on with your lives.
306
And that late-stage money is stuck at a 1X, 0% IRR for the next three years.
307
Knock yourself out.
308
It's a really big deal.
309
It's a theme of a lot of these sort of implicit protections we thought we had in venture.
310
To me, the big learning was that acquirers wouldn't buy you unless 98% of folks agreed, okay?
311
Some of these implicit protections are kind of breaking down.
312
So, like one of the worst investments I did, they were only able to get 80.1% of the shareholders to agree to it, to an exit.
313
The acquirer didn't care at all.
314
Whatever the statutory minimum was, okay, the acquired didn't care.
315
Just didn't even care 1%, didn't even attempt to get the votes from the other 19.9%, didn't care.
316
And I think what all these things have in common is the capitalist universe is recognizing that there's $2.7 trillion of privately held assets that are going to have to get public, find a home, and it's going to involve a little more complexity than normal.
317
But the great thing about capitalism is people find a way.
318
In the case of Hinge, they found a way to get it public with a preferred stock.
319
In the case of your deal, they found a way to just close the deal and accept the risk.
320
And I think we're going to see a lot of that because that's what it's going to take to kind of deal with these 600 unicorns.
321
Yeah.
322
Anything you can get around, people are going to get around it to go public or make a dollar, right?
323
But I got interested, as one does.
324
And I pulled a pre-IPO Articles Incorporation.
325
What are the terms right now?
326
And it's super interesting.
327
The last two rounds do not have a block.
328
They can be auto-converted provided, I think, the $6 billion round, above $6 billion, all the preferred converts to common.
329
There's no way for those preferred to remain outstanding, just convert to common at any price above $6 billion.
330
So to answer your question, Harry, in that case, those investors will record an immediate mark-to-market.
331
I had a 1X at $25 billion.
332
Now I have a 0.5X at $12 billion.
333
I've taken a loss.
334
And it all boils down to one little term deep in the bowels of the lick preference, auto-convert terms, which is what Hinge didn't have, what these guys did.
335
So they're going to crystallize the loss.
336
They're going to crystallize the loss.
337
Exactly.
338
In the case of Hinge, the preferred investors are just going to sit there with a 1x in an illiquid instrument in a liquid common stock.
339
In the case of CHIME, they're going to get auto-converted provided it clears $6 billion.
340
And if you are still carrying that at $25 billion, you're going to record a significant loss.
341
If you've written it down already, you're fine.
342
So this is more the great game that we thought it was, which is you get your money back, and then when it pops, you get the premium on top.
343
Absolutely.
344
No, no.
345
There's a whole bunch.
346
I mean, this is my, and I've been, that's why I said, if you zoom out a million miles, this is all about what happens to those 600 unicorns, right?
347
The interesting fact is, and Jason circulated the SVB work, these are the best unicorns.
348
These are the unicorns that can go public.
349
And what you're seeing is some of the late-stage money has protection, keeps its 1x, and has a miserable IRR.
350
Some of the late-stage money cuts a deal and says, I'll roll.
351
And then some of the late-stage money has no damn choice and just gets converted to common and takes a loss.
352
There's a lot going on here.
353
Oh, God, no, no, I'm not loving the Cedars for Suckers anymore.
354
This late stage is hard.
355
That is hard.
356
Everything is hard.
357
Oh, God, that's not nice.
358
If you're in Chime, you're going to crystallize those losses.
359
You're going to lose 50%.
360
Well, maybe not.
361
Maybe it trades at 12 or 15, but I don't know where it trades, to be clear.
362
And I think it could trade much closer to that.
363
All I can say for sure is they don't have a, there is a mandatory conversion where the later stage rounds don't have a block.
364
And if that conversion is exercised, they will be converted to common at whatever the prevailing price is.
365
My only takeaway from this is I want to be Jim Andelman with Mountain.
366
Now you just, we're just circling back and forth.
367
As you say, we hated Seed a week ago.
368
Now we're like, oh my God, no bullshit.
369
I just want to be at Seed in 2013 or 2010.
370
Turns out vintage is the single most important and underrated part of venture capital.
371
Just being there for the good news.
372
Listen, you mentioned the brilliant report that Jason shared.
373
I thought one really interesting element was accelerators and incubators are 24% of all VC deals.
374
24% accelerators and incubators.
375
Does that mean YC has just won this game?
376
How did you guys read that?
377
For the first time recently, there is more competition, right, at the accelerator incubator phase.
378
There's more, right?
379
But YC is four batches and bigger than ever.
380
I do think they've won.
381
And they also did one of the greatest, not only they did two tilts.
382
It's not the same YC as it used to be.
383
First of all, bringing in Gary was a massive change.
384
Obviously, an uplift, right?
385
For sure, a level up, but also just massive change on all levels.
386
And two, I mean, it's obvious, but massively tilting into AI when they weren't ahead of the curve and being a center for it to attract the best talent.
387
It's very fluid, but man, you know, right or wrong, and I'm not into the brands, but people want to go to Harvard, Stanford, and MIT, and the kids want to go to YC, right?
388
And they're doing this massive event for hundreds of the best kids in college, right?
389
This, this, very soon with the best.
390
And, you know, it seems new, but when I look back, you know, all of my first investments were in some sort of accelerator, five out of five, right?
391
So it's not brand new.
392
It's just bigger than ever.
393
I think your absolute assumption has to be YC has won.
394
Look, it's the greatest, one of the greatest equity businesses ever.
395
And I deliberately use the word business as distinguished fund.
396
Think about being a fund, an investor like any of us, is you only as good, as I said many times, you're only as good as your last game.
397
Every day you got to get up, make good new picks.
398
And if you blink and if you get the picks wrong, you're done.
399
You're out.
400
The world doesn't need you, right?
401
There's 600, 700 people funds like you.
402
The beauty of YC is they've got a business.
403
And the definition of a business, if the owner of that business, Paul Graham, can be sitting back in England, walking around the cute little bookstores and the machine keeps humming.
404
That's a damn great business.
405
Why is it so great?
406
Because the world needs one, the valley needs at least one big accelerator like that.
407
Whereas you say, Jason, they'll take in anyone, provided they have the smarts and the nouse, and they can convert those two people from London, those one person from Sweden, those two people from the Midwest, and in the space of three short months, convert them into highly marketable properties in return for a mere 7%.
408
The world needs that product, and it needs it on an industrial basis.
409
And give them credit.
410
Give Paul Graham credit.
411
The original stated intent was make it easier.
412
You can say sometimes it's better run than others.
413
Some CEOs of that business are better than others.
414
The current CEO seems to be doing a pretty amazing job.
415
It's just a great business.
416
And I did the math once and trying to figure out: seed is not what we do, but how much better is the YC locked-in return than a seed fund at the same stage?
417
They basically have roughly a 2X advantage.
418
If you say to yourself, if I look at the deals they do, and then if you extrapolate based on the published hit rates and success rates, if a seed fund investing at that stage with decent picking gets a 3X, they get a 6X.
419
It's a structural economic advantage that's very compelling.
420
It's a great business.
421
And it should be a great business because at the risk of sounding like a defender of free market capitalism, it met a market need at scale.
422
It met it brilliantly.
423
And therefore, they deserve the return.
424
Go, team.
425
Wish I thought of it.
426
For second-time, third-time founders, it's still a niche product, I think, in my ecosystem.
427
For folks that have been around, for every Parker Conrad that wants to do it again at a much better deal, other founders don't get it, right?
428
But for man, for the first-time founders, it's just that and Project Europe are the beacons.
429
Absolutely.
430
I mean, if I have to say, it is astonishing.
431
I mean, this is what gives me hope for Europe, honestly.
432
You know, we have 8,000 applicants of Project Europe.
433
300, 400 of them are pretty fucking awesome.
434
It's amazing.
435
Could not agree more.
436
I mean, it's that kind of thing that just wasn't there.
437
Again, going back to the mission, I give Paul Graham as just one of the clearest things.
438
I've never met the man, read a lot of this.
439
He's just such a clear thinker.
440
And the objective was make it easier for founders to start companies.
441
And that's the kind of thing you're.
442
Most of them will be mediocre, that's life, but some of them can be freaking amazing and cover a multitude of sins.
443
That's the way it's meant to work.
444
So, you know, go project Europe.
445
I think the thing that's so amazing about it is, you know, I always say the future of venture is one by Walmart and it's won by Chanel.
446
Chanel, the incredible brand with a very specific customer base, Walmart, whatever product you want, they've got it.
447
And what I think is so special about YC is it's Walmart and Chanel.
448
They have scale and they've retained brand.
449
That's very still an aspirational brand that has managed to do scale.
450
One of the, let me repeat, I believe it to be one of the great enduring equity businesses in the sense of businesses, there's lots of funds, there's very few enduring brands that occupy a clear niche.
451
And the test to run is, if they went away, would someone else rise to fill the gap?
452
Absolutely, because the world needs that product.
453
If the 600 venture firm went away, we might just stop at 5.99 and say, we're good, thank you.
454
And that's the difference.
455
If we move slightly down the funding spectrum from seed to A, you know, I like to start with some comment that is completely unsubstantiated with data, but I feel like Series A is the hardest place to be investing today.
456
When you hear me say that, do you agree with me?
457
And what's your take?
458
I guess my question then is, if seed is so easy, that's really troubling, the combination, isn't it?
459
I mean, it means we're underestimating the failure rate to Series A, right?
460
Seed is easy because it's Walt Disney versus Jerry Maguire.
461
Walt Disney is telling me the story.
462
There's lots of people that tell a good story and come from great companies.
463
And then Jerry Maguire is show me the money.
464
And there's actually very few people who are showing the money in a way that's actually.
465
Sorry, seed is good and series A is hard.
466
Weirdly enough, I agree with you, despite the data.
467
On the one hand, the conversion rate from seed to A per the Carter data has gone way down.
468
On the other hand, I think what you're saying is correct is for the stuff that's working and in the chosen hot markets, there is mass competition because everyone wants to get the early traction in those AI companies that are just starting to explode.
469
So you are correct.
470
If you are in the chosen sweet spots, almost every venture person is looking at those deals.
471
And yes, those are the very few widely competitive.
472
Look, we competed in a couple of deals in a kind of broadly recognized emerging AI space, poorly competitive, didn't win, I think, got outpriced on one, out-beauty contested on the other.
473
So that's pretty tough.
474
So you say to yourself, first of all, what about the other 75%?
475
The odd thing is, what we're saying effectively is it's hard to invest in Series A companies while 75% of the companies you could be investing in are dying and struggling for capital.
476
So there's a little part of me that says, maybe I need to figure out the non-obvious Serie A and make some money that way.
477
So yeah, it's only tough when you're competing for the best.
478
Because again, back to the, it turns out to be hard to make money.
479
It is hard.
480
It's funny, going to Rory's point of whatever you look at looks harder.
481
I was thinking the other day, Revenue Cat where Harry and I, both, our investors, announced it raised its last round at 500 million, which actually was lowish.
482
They just did a deal in one hour, 500 million valuation.
483
And I invested, I was the first investor in 2018 at seven pre, okay, at seven.
484
That was right before YC.
485
And I thought about a deal I did in the last batch that was probably the same risk profile at 30.
486
So seven versus 30.
487
How does that math work?
488
If the fund size is the same, do I need four times bigger a fund?
489
Am I taking four times higher risk?
490
Help me think about this.
491
Like, because I'm roughly thinking, now, granted, upside has gone up, right?
492
That's the meta point, right?
493
But they're still, I would say they're the same, but at four times the price versus 2018.
494
So do you adjust check size or adjust ownership on entry?
495
I feel like I have no choice.
496
If the round is bigger, you write a bigger check.
497
If the round is smaller, because it's like a YC deal and they don't need as much money, you write a smaller check.
498
I honestly feel like I have no choice.
499
That's not new.
500
That's not, when I invested in RevenueCat, the first investor, I wanted to put twice as much money in.
501
I just wasn't allowed to, right?
502
I could only buy 10%.
503
But that is a question, right?
504
Either way.
505
But like, it's for, where do I get the 4x?
506
Four times the fund or four times the risk?
507
You know, in mild consolation, Jason, I'd probably say it's only around probably 2.5x worse off in the sense of you do have to give some credence for the fact, as I've mentioned earlier, we've just had huge GDP inflation over the last five or seven years.
508
So, you know, a buck 10 years ago is probably 60, 50 cents.
509
Now today on a GDP basis, not just inflation, but inflation plus growth, which is what you got to look at.
510
So it's probably not four times worse, but you are correct.
511
It is probably at least two times and maybe two and a half times as risky per dollar as it was.
512
That's the first thing.
513
And then the second thing is you're exactly right.
514
You do have to expand the check size because the truth is you have to play the game on the field.
515
And we've seen that at our stage, which I think of as typically at least a stage later than you, right?
516
We had roughly the same ownership targets for 50 and plus 10.
517
And that's just the nature of the beast.
518
And I have a slide in our deck when we point it out to the LPs and just say, look, this is the dynamic of the marketplace we're in now.
519
And this is the scary part of the game.
520
Do you guys honestly get 15%?
521
We typically get around 10, 11% ownership, and that's been pretty consistent across five, six funds.
522
So all the way back to 2009.
523
It's a pretty typical median.
524
We don't navigate off ownership targets because, as I tell people, I would happily go later and take less ownership if I could get our target return.
525
But in the pricing environment for the last frankie decade, it's been almost impossible to have clarity on average that a later stage round would give you kind of your target return.
526
Now, obviously, some later stage rounds have given amazing return, and we can come back to that discussion some other time.
527
But on average, probably not.
528
So it's typically being those early revenue, $2, $3 million growing hyper-quick, where you're glad to get 10 and 20 is not on the table.
529
For sure.
530
Everyone gets less ownership than they claim on Twitter, right?
531
Every seed manager is like, we've raised a new $30 million fund.
532
Our target ownership is 15.
533
We're going to do 25 of those in the fund.
534
And the math just doesn't make sense in planet Earth, right?
535
But for me, the bigger learning, Rory, you figure this out.
536
I mean, you'll laugh when I say this, but this snuck up on me is now that companies hold these investments, you hold them for so long, I did not fully understand the compounding nature of dilution.
537
Totally.
538
If you model 6% dilution per year for a portfolio company, for hiring, and you hold this, help me compound it, and you hold it.
539
I mean, it's obviously not 9%, but you're exactly right because it's a descending scale.
540
But no, look, the impact of dilution over time is huge.
541
On the other hand, you can't avoid it because you want to hire this people.
542
No, it's an interesting discussion because honestly, the least, I would say, enjoyable, least rewarded, but most necessary part of my job as a board member is I'm often on comm committees where you're trying to set up policies for companies, not in their first four years of life, but in year seven, eight, 10, where you got to grant new shares, you got to re-up founders.
543
And sometimes I think that's a very legitimate thing to do because you want them incented, but at the same time, you've got to manage overall dilution.
544
And, you know, trying to keep it down probably not to the six, 5%, but the 3%, 4% level and manage that over time is just really important because you're exactly right.
545
6% a year for six or seven years or even 10 years is just a huge impact on everyone, including the founders, including the initial equity investors.
546
So yeah, spending a lot of time on refresh policies for mid-stage tech companies is, as I say, the combination of low-value, low-joy, high-impact work.
547
It's so funny you say that.
548
I mean, I was with an investor this morning.
549
He said, actually, the challenge with LLM investments, and we have one of the best, is that actually the employee stock is 9% a year.
550
It's not the 6%, it's 9% to 10.
551
And so actually, the level of valuation on the employee stock grants is so much higher than traditional that it makes it an even harder venture category to invest in, which I thought was interesting.
552
I think it's gone up.
553
When I just look, I wish I had all the data, but Harry's point, when I just look, my kind of insight, the exits.
554
The dilution, I made up a term dilution profile, which probably makes no sense, but that was the term I made up on SAS a while ago.
555
It was much lower than today in 2021.
556
I look at those exits and I'm like, man, I owned, that was pretty good.
557
What was my if I looked at the companies today?
558
I'm like, I'm not going to own that much at those exits, right?
559
And so they better be much bigger exits because otherwise, man, I'm going to own so much less.
560
So when I go into a deal, I assume 40% dilution from my entry.
561
Is that a reasonable heuristic, or do you think I'm over or underassible?
562
It's too low for seed.
563
For A, it might be okay.
564
Or, no, it's way too low.
565
I think you've got to assume now two-thirds dilution from seed if you don't do pro-Rad at IPO, two-thirds.
566
Well, I think there's two types of dilution, obviously.
567
There's the following line dilution, and then just purely the option dilution.
568
And I'm not sure what you guys are talking about.
569
I'm combining them all to two-thirds.
570
It used to be half.
571
I think it used to be half if you didn't do it.
572
Now I think it's approaching some thirds.
573
Absolutely.
574
I mean, look, there's a very pure test of this, which is with lots of data associated with it.
575
You just look at the Y Combinator because they have a fixed ownership every time.
576
They have 5,000 data points.
577
So if you felt strongly about calculating the answer here, you just look at their ownership on IPO and you have a statistically valid sample and go do the work.
578
And that's why they've dramatically increased their ownership.
579
There are no dummies there at the Y Combinator.
580
I think we should all be.
581
First, moving to post-money instead of pre-money as so-called for the benefit of the founders and then raising their ownership and then having any dilution and then investing more.
582
They're the only ones that have caught up, I think, as YC, the dilution of more power.
583
I want to go back to the foundation model comment because I think it's something that we should internalize.
584
And you better just internalize that's the way the way it is.
585
The important people in the equation are the people with the IQ and the STEM knowledge and the ability to generate these models.
586
And anyone running those companies is going to pay those people what it takes to keep them.
587
Frankly, tough shit on the dilution for the capital provider side.
588
You know, that's the nature of competing in a huge talent war for small numbers of people who can do amazing things.
589
So, yes, you can bitch about it and say, oh my God, that's awful, but it's a cost of doing business, right?
590
And I think it segues.
591
I mean, look, we just had the largest single instance of dilution in a foundation model in terms of the acquisition this week, which is obviously at some level in Aquihire.
592
So, what you can see is it turns out it takes 2% dilution or $6 billion to hire one really great VP of hardware engineering and a solid team under him.
593
The capital providers are along for the ride.
594
You better like the terms of trade and at least internalize them.
595
You don't have to like them, but you have to accept them if you want to play.
596
The terms of trade are being set by the leaders of these companies and their need to attract that amazing talent in a very competitive world.
597
It was funny, I was looking.
598
How do you say it is an MNTN that IPO'd?
599
Is it Mountain Two?
600
They call it Mountain, by the way.
601
MNTN.
602
I should know that.
603
I was looking, you know, founded, I think, in 2009, and immediately, Jim Andelman, who's at Bonfire, who I don't know, he's an OG SaaS investor, I immediately flipped the prospectus and said, How much does he own after all these years, right?
604
Because I think it was probably in Bonfire 1.
605
It was probably a very small fund.
606
We could look it up, 20, 30 million.
607
And he still owned 9.something percent at IPO.
608
And I'm like, that's old school.
609
This is going to be a good deal for him, right?
610
But if he owns 180 million on a 20 or 30 million dollar fund, that's a great outcome, right?
611
Today it would be, today, in a company just like Mountain Today, you don't have that at IPO or less, right?
612
And the fund size might be five times bigger for seed.
613
So instead of a 6x5 or 6x performer, it might be a 1x, right?
614
Sign to the times.
615
You actually had this with Michael Kim at Sandana.
616
He said that Eric 12X DPI'd the fund with honey for mucca.
617
Yep.
618
Returned $280 million to them.
619
I thought it was incredible.
620
Well, would that happen with Honey Today, right?
621
Probably not, right?
622
The thing is, when you look at these old deals, they're great because they were all modeled on much smaller exits, right?
623
And much less competition.
624
So you could get the ownership.
625
And these old school founders, often you don't see the same dilution.
626
Like I didn't, I read through the perspective, I didn't say anything, but I bet the Mountain guys were very conservative, right?
627
There's no way Jim could own 10% over all those years if the founders were giving away 10, 12% of the company a year.
628
I also think, you know, it's, as they say, horses for courses.
629
They were playing a different game.
630
And even today, there are different versions of the game.
631
I think Mountain was trying to build a profitable company in a pretty, I won't say well understood, but a defined space where you're not competing against the gazillion companies.
632
Even at the time, you weren't competing against the largest value market cap companies on the planet.
633
It's very different than if you're building an LLM today and you have, you know, you're competing against Microsoft, you're competing against Google, you're competing against OpenAI.
634
It's the wars that you choose to engage in dictate what it has to take to win.
635
So I think that, and the bigger ha for you as a founder in markets that are significant but by no means the hugeness of the AI Foundation model bet.
636
And Mountain is a great example of that, as is Hinge, the other IPO in the last week.
637
Two really solid companies, 200 million plus in revenue, growing 30 to 50 percent, depending on the two deals.
638
Solid outcomes, multi-billion dollar outcomes.
639
Everyone involves made money, but we'll come back to some nuances on that.
640
Great classic venture outcomes, just a very different game.
641
When you're trying to compete with someone who has publicly stated, it's going to take another approximately half $50 billion to get to cash off break-even.
642
It's just a different game.
643
I do just want to take this a bit in turn because there's so many elements that are.
644
You know, we mentioned Johnny Ive.
645
Obviously, we saw the acquisition for $6.5 billion of his design studio/slash company by OpenAI.
646
Is it a simple aqua hire?
647
And when I say simple, I don't mean cheap, but is it a simple aqua hire bringing Johnny into a hardware play for OpenAI?
648
How did you guys read it?
649
Well, look, first of all, it was really interesting that he's not joining full-time.
650
He's still managing his design firm, which was an important point that I don't know, I'm sure it's been worked out, but super interesting, it was clear he's not joining full-time.
651
He's still managing his design firm.
652
They're just buying the startup that he's a founder of.
653
For the $6 billion, is it $6 billion?
654
Is that what it was?
655
They're not even getting him full-time.
656
They might be getting, I bet they're getting most of his time.
657
Like, I'm sure he's their top client.
658
I thought, of all things, that was a sign of the time that you had to pay $6 billion, but you could get away with not getting the guy full-time as part of the deal.
659
Sam's so smart, right?
660
And he was clear in that video.
661
He's like, I want the third device, right?
662
The laptop, the third device.
663
And at first, I laughed.
664
I'm like, of course, that's what every tech guy in San Francisco, tech dude in San Francisco wants.
665
But then they said, listen, ChatGPT has crossed 20 minutes per day for the average user.
666
So going from 20 to 200 with a device for a small percent of your market cap, so you could have 10x the coverage, 20x the coverage of a life.
667
If this is the right guy and the right team, that might be the best investment they can make to go from 20 minutes to 200 minutes, to 20 minutes to 200.
668
I think we're going to live in a world where our AIs listen to us 24 hours a day, one way or the other, whether it's on our watch or this device or on our screen or in the background, like Granola or Notion.
669
Like it's always going to be listening.
670
And I think it might be a war he has to win to always be listening.
671
Might is, of course, the word here.
672
It's like, it might work.
673
My perspective is every single significant software platform company develops at some point in their life hardware paranoia.
674
The feeling that somehow the hardware guys are going to screw them.
675
And the only way they can stop themselves is by spending a whole ton of money attempting to build a hardware platform.
676
They almost invariably fail.
677
Making sure that doesn't happen to you and kind of scratching that terrified itch is just a part of doing business.
678
I mean, if you look, if you step back, Microsoft, oh my God, Nokia is going to, we should buy Nokia.
679
Oh my God, we should build a surface.
680
If you look at Facebook, it's like, oh, my God, we should build these VR devices because otherwise we're going to lose in the multiverse.
681
If you look at Google, we need to, quote, own the phone so they crank out pixels at absolutely no margin.
682
Everyone does it.
683
So, you know, who is Sam to break this time-honored tradition of spending a lot of money on a hardware device?
684
And then my guess is statistically, the likely outcome just based on the priors of the other companies in the space is three, five years later, it turns into.
685
It will launch in a year.
686
It will be massively subsidized.
687
So, it'll be 20 bucks for this device.
688
Okay.
689
They will figure out the form factor.
690
I don't know what the right combination is, whether it's embedded in your ear, like the barista, the cool coffee guys wear, or it's that lid you wear backwards.
691
And within a year, we will be living all day long in AI, and the timing will be perfect.
692
This is great because we now actually have something that we can track and disagree.
693
What you're saying, I'm saying I don't think it'll produce anything meaningful or significant revenue driver, but it's okay to do.
694
I'm not saying it's dumb.
695
I'm simply saying it's an itch that every platform vendor has to scratch.
696
What you're saying is you believe that we will look back two or three years later and go, wow, they shipped a meaningful device with meaningful hardware revenues as part of the overall open AI business model.
697
I think he said he's going to ship 200 million, and I don't think that was a throwaway comment.
698
Here's the difference between us: one difference, though, is I spent almost two hours a day in AI already.
699
Yes.
700
Four months ago, I didn't.
701
I spend two hours a day in AI between our AI, AI tools, everything.
702
Okay, I don't do anything without AI anymore.
703
And so I could already see it.
704
Listen, I'm scared about it.
705
I'm scared that ChatGPT will now rewrite itself to not shut down.
706
I don't think that's a joke.
707
I don't think it's a joke that Anthropic Opus 4 is threatening researchers with blackmail for affairs.
708
I don't think it's a joke.
709
But I'm already in two hours a day for AI, all day long.
710
I mean, literally at a SASTRANIAL this year, one of the folks that helped put us on, he rewrote the best summary of the day that day, of his day.
711
He led an entire day.
712
He hosted our chief customer officer summit, John Gleason.
713
And then that day, he wrote the best summary of the entire day.
714
How did he do it?
715
He just had granola running on his phone 24-7.
716
Granola just runs, Granola and the new feature from Notion are pretty cool and pretty creepy.
717
They run at the hardware level.
718
You don't know it's a note-taker.
719
You can't see anything.
720
It's recording every minute of the day.
721
Agreed with all that, Jason.
722
But actually, the key sentence for 200 million consumers is it ran in the phone.
723
How many people are going to be willing to spend $200, $300,000, $400 for another device and then make it part of their daily lives?
724
It'll be $20.
725
It'll be $50.
726
And it'll be cool.
727
The thing is, Johnny Ive will make it cool.
728
If it's cool, it's the elusive next device.
729
And I think all Sam needs is for it to be cool and to work, right?
730
Just think about the Ray-Bands, like the connected Ray-Bands that everybody has.
731
It's wildly successful.
732
But going back, my first comment is: I think it's okay to try that because when you're at the stage, those, you know, OpenAI is that, you should make those bets.
733
And it gets right back to the comment on dilution, even, right?
734
Just think about it.
735
Two people got 2% of OpenAI in the last three months.
736
One of them wrote a $6 billion check.
737
Have any of us ever seen $6 billion?
738
Have any of us ever had it in our account?
739
No.
740
And then the other one signed a part-time working deal and sold his 55-person design studio in and got the same amount of money.
741
If that doesn't show where the capital providers stand in the hierarchy, in the great AI race, nothing does.
742
I'm sitting there as soft bank or someone like that.
743
I just wired you $6 billion.
744
And you effectively took that $6 billion and gave exactly the same ownership to a 55-person startup.
745
I think we will need to remember that Sam will need to go out and raise more money.
746
He says he's need to spend $50 billion.
747
What this enables him in terms of a storytelling narrative is unbelievable.
748
Now he's got a hardware.
749
The Saudis will give him more money than he needs with this new chapter, this new challenge that needs funding.
750
It's a great story.
751
Absolutely.
752
20 minutes, 20 minutes to 24 hours is a great story.
753
That would be my slide.
754
We're going from 20 minutes a day to 24 hours a day.
755
If Chat GPT could be monetized per minute and then per human, that's a lot more revenue.
756
20 minutes to 24 hours.
757
That's a lot.
758
That's maybe the strongest PowerPoint argument that ChatGPT is underrated, right?
759
But I think without this, to get another 20 billion for another next model, that's hot.
760
It's a good insight.
761
It's a good insight.
762
I probably missed.
763
Totally agree with you guys.
764
In terms of storytelling, this is the kind of thing you do.
765
And that's the thing in these hyper-growth markets where almost nothing is certain, you would far prefer to take the dilution and cover the base than be wrong and get sideswiped.
766
But right now, making that kind of bet totally makes sense.
767
It's also 2% of market cap.
768
It's not a Hail Mary.
769
And Harry, I can say it is the Hail Mary.
770
You're sitting back there in England and you must look at Johnny Ive and go, oh my God, if every STEM and design graduate from every high-quality London college isn't figuring out how to get on a plane and go to San Francisco, I don't know what they're thinking.
771
$6 billion.
772
What I'm thinking, Roy?
773
I'm thinking, ha, Americans still have to buy Europeans to get some taste.
774
You know, the other thing I did kind of like that.
775
You're exactly right, Harry.
776
That's why Europe has one very rich entrepreneur who does taste, Bernie Arnaud, and we have the other nine who does tech and have all the money.
777
So knock yourself out with your taste.
778
Taste you can buy.
779
Years of trying.
780
You guys create fuckable enterprise value.
781
We have a Russian in London who creates a $100 billion behemoth that makes chime and everyone else look like kids play.
782
I want to go back on that.
783
I didn't realize you're going off on that tangent.
784
That partly, I'll tell you very directly, that's partly because you have a mediocre incumbent banking sector there, and thus there's a huge amount of surplus value to be extracted.
785
It's just like, what's the guys in Brazil?
786
I'm sorry, Nubank, right?
787
The crappier the existing banks, the bigger the opportunity for fintech.
788
And broadly speaking, in the United States, with a few exceptions, some of these comes, these existing guys are pretty efficient.
789
So you're right.
790
There wasn't the same idiocy to kind of attack there.
791
So the market cap, so the opportunity for fintech, it was a tougher business to get to scale.
792
Now, you had the countervailing fact that you have kind of the visa and interchange revenues, which are pretty exciting in the U.S.
793
So that's been an advantage to the U.S.
794
over Europe where they're more capped.
795
But yeah, I don't think attributing success in fintech in London to the greater entrepreneurial qualities of Russians living in the UK is perhaps the most logical analysis, Harry.
796
I agree.
797
We should instead look at a Swede who creates Spotify and changes the music industry and creates a $100 billion company.
798
You're right, yes.
799
Look, I'm delighted to see you guys have some wins.
800
Genuine comment.
801
It's wonderful to see Europe have some wins.
802
But unfortunately, the data just shows the vast majority of market cap in technology is being created, first of all, in the United States, second of all in China.
803
And then Europe is a far this and third.
804
It would be good for the United States if Europe would get its act together and have amazing technology companies, but for some reason, you just don't seem to be capable of doing it.
805
Wow.
806
Sorry, that was harsh.
807
This wasn't even on the agenda, Harry.
808
This wasn't even on the agenda.
809
So we're missing it.
810
No, I don't disagree.
811
Actually, Harry, can I ask you a question about a vibe check?
812
Because I'm curious, right?
813
I mean, I've been coming to London for years and done a lot of Euro to US, but the pull of SF for AI is so powerful, right?
814
We can argue over France, but it is powerful to founders.
815
Is it powerful in the entrepreneurs that you meet in Project Europe?
816
I mean, EF is hybrid now, isn't it?
817
I mean, EF is basically I'm going to get in trouble for this.
818
EF sold itself out by going to San Francisco.
819
It's a complete sellout.
820
To your question of like, actually, you know, one, we have a huge amount of people who say you can only build companies in Silicon Valley.
821
And so people are.
822
And I'm not one of them.
823
I'm not one of them.
824
It's very, very aware within the founder communities that it is incredibly hard to retain great talent in SF.
825
It's incredibly expensive.
826
And you're competing against Open AI and Anthropic.
827
And so, yes, it has the allure of Hollywood for our industry.
828
But I think when you dig beneath the surface, the smart ones are going, actually, I can get better people for cheaper in London, where DeepMind is, where unbelievable AI talent is.
829
Absolutely.
830
It's just that the reason I asked about the Vibe, absolutely, you can't afford anybody in the Bay Area, right, as a startup.
831
The inflation is so high to our point.
832
But the SF area is not what it was pre-2020.
833
Okay.
834
In some ways, it's smaller.
835
In some ways, it is smaller.
836
But if you're a solo founder, if you don't know anybody, if you're an outsider, but the sense of community in AI that you get in the Bay Area, the sense of community is so powerful.
837
In 2019, I would tell founders to come to the Bay Area because if you're in B2B, you walk down the street, you're going to see everybody because we're all working in an office.
838
But it's more this community.
839
I underestimated the power of sitting in Dog Patch, seeing every YC founder, seeing Sam Altman on the streets, seeing everybody.
840
The density is actually higher than 2019 for AI, only for founders, not for SDRs, not for marketing managers, not for everybody else, but for founders, it's not so the density.
841
It's a smaller community for sure.
842
But that actually makes my life easier because we have three companies which are crushing and have created an ecosystem just in themselves, which is 11 Labs, Synthesia, and Granola.
843
And all three of them have created a mentality that you can build amazing AI businesses in London.
844
And so it's actually easier for me because it's a much more concentrated supply of great AI talent that's not as distributed as the Bay.
845
And so as long as you're in the hackathons and as long as you're hanging around 11 Labs and hanging with Matty, you're kind of a near greatness.
846
It's easy.
847
But do you feel?
848
Do you feel as a founder?
849
And this is going to sound facetious, but it's not.
850
Do you feel in London with Granola and 11 Labs and Synthesia, right?
851
I'm fans of all of them, right?
852
Do you feel like you're failing every day as a founder?
853
Because that's the special part of being an SF.
854
You feel like you're failing every day compared to everybody around.
855
If there's only three, I might feel like I'm doing pretty well.
856
It took me a while to internalize what you're actually saying.
857
It wasn't, I thought you were saying, are you failing in London?
858
What you're basically saying is the core San Francisco value prop is a feeling of depression, is a feeling that no matter how well you're doing, someone else is doing better and you just got to compete more.
859
I'm not joking, even in me, I feel like a failure every day in the Bay Area.
860
And sitting here in the beach where I am for one week, I'm feeling like I'm a success story right here, right now.
861
I'm not being, I'm not kidding.
862
I feel like, you know, I haven't been full-time in the Bay Area other than this last year, and I felt like a failure every day.
863
The YC company, it hasn't announced yet that I did, right?
864
The one I compared it to, right?
865
The founders, pretty good AI guys.
866
Like, I'm 26, I feel like a failure.
867
I had one small exit, I'm falling behind everybody, right?
868
Literally works seven and a half days a week.
869
He's at me, and it's just that failure feeling, I think it's bigger than ever.
870
And I just think it drives founders.
871
You know, I yell at some of my founders to feel like you're failing sometimes.
872
I yell at them.
873
I'm like, you should feel that way.
874
Listen, my mother would argue that I have too high an opinion of myself, but I have a high opinion of myself.
875
I'm a fucking machine, and I am not motivated by an external person.
876
I'm motivated by the internal of me.
877
And the greatest founders that I know are motivated by the internal fire.
878
And being in London, I push myself every day to be better.
879
Yeah, everyone around me is relatively mediocre in terms of London, generally speaking, generally growing population-wise.
880
I didn't need them to feel for failure.
881
I will push myself.
882
And the best founders push themselves.
883
I don't think that the London versus San Francisco thing is a function of that, to be honest.
884
I think anyone who's built a successful company, like the tweet you mentioned, Harry, the truth is, the drive that it takes to do that in a country where it's not the norm, in my view, speaks to something even more powerful and entrepreneurial than those entrepreneurs, right?
885
Because over here, it's almost like you go to Stanford, you drop out, you go to Y.
886
Whereas for someone having been an entrepreneur and frankly failed in London, in the UK, and gone bust, it's incredibly hard in Europe to be entrepreneurial.
887
And therefore, the people who do it have something really determined and awesome about them.
888
So, I do believe that at the human level, those guys, I'm not worried that those guys aren't competitive enough.
889
I don't think that's the issue.
890
I think the real issue is not, yeah, because I generally find people are roughly the same the world over.
891
I think what is true is the systems to become successful are way more powerful in the Bay Area than in Europe.
892
And you'd like those systems in Europe to be better, but just as an objective statement of fact, your ability to bounce back from failure, your ability to get capital a second time, it's all the other things that make it a lot easier in the U.S.
893
to be successful.
894
In fact, to make this very concrete, I always used to say to people talking about Europe: exceptional people rise to the top anywhere in the world.
895
The strength of the United States economic system is we can take mediocre people and make them down successful.
896
That is the secret superpower of the U.S.
897
free market economy.
898
The truth is, the mediocre people in Europe can often drift off, government jobs, whatever, safe sinecures.
899
In the United States, the free market system keeps the whip on everybody's back, and as such, a lot more people have to strive and become successful.
900
I don't think there's any lack of genius in the UK, in Europe, just as there isn't here.
901
I don't think there's any lack of drive in the senior people.
902
It's just the systems to transform that individual talent and drive into a successful ecosystem are just so much stronger here.
903
We mentioned you, Alingo, there, and we kind of go forward on this.
904
Jason, you're always procluding that, you know, AI is going to replace all of our jobs, all of our jobs, and then we've had a pack.
905
So the question is: are leaders getting way ahead of their skis and then walking back?
906
And is this going to be a continuing trend?
907
You know, I thought when I read that, it sounded to me like every backstage conversation I had at Saster Annual this year with public company CEOs, which is they're trying to guide folks to a truth.
908
Not everyone can say what Fiverr said, right?
909
And so he got there really fast.
910
Listen, we're going to go AI first, and we're not going to hire anybody we don't need to.
911
AI can do better than our contractors, and we're only going to hire people when we have to.
912
And I think CEOs for public companies are trying to prepare their teams for it, but the backlash was too strong.
913
So I just think he had to walk it back to 70% of the truth.
914
We still need the same number of employees.
915
In fact, they all say, in fact, we're hiring.
916
That's what the public companies always say, whatever they say, in fact, we're hiring, because that seems to take the edge off.
917
But I think they're just walking back the fact that everybody knows they don't need 30, 40% of the team they have today.
918
Everybody says this.
919
Not just everyone past, you know, not if you're 50 people like Granola, but everyone with 500 employees and up that I talked to off the record, including public companies, says, I don't know what I don't need 30 to 40% of my team.
920
I think we're going to see mass layoffs in the next 24 months.
921
I think the net headcount is going to stay flat, right?
922
But I think he just walked it back because it's too hard for people to hear.
923
It's too hard.
924
And there's only so much honesty you can get from the CEO.
925
Just for some stats, in 10 years, they made 140 courses with humans.
926
In a year, they made 140 courses.
927
So 10 years of work took them one year with AI.
928
I think actually on this one, I think Jason's 100% right.
929
I think you see every one of the CEOs kind of oscillating between two extremes on AI.
930
One extreme is, it's going to make us widely efficient because I'm sucking up to Wall Street.
931
And I probably over-promise on that side.
932
And you saw Klarna do that and have to walk that back.
933
And then on the other side, when you kind of do the AI is going to change everything, and we're going to save a whole bunch of people, then your other constituents, your internal constituents, which are your employees, kind of lose their shit and you have to walk that back too.
934
So what I think people are going to evolve to, as Jason said, is the very bland statement, which is, you know, we're going to adopt AI.
935
It's going to make everything better.
936
I'm not going to threaten mass, quote, mass layoffs.
937
And I'll come back to that in a second.
938
It'll just make things better.
939
Oh, and by the way, we're hiring.
940
Jason nailed it exactly.
941
We have evolved to standard corporate speak for how you talk about AI.
942
It's going to make us efficient, Wall Street, wink, wink.
943
People, no one's going to get fired.
944
We're just going to, you know, you're just going to do more interesting things.
945
That's the current state of the lie.
946
The good news, I think, separate comment is: I think it'll be just fine.
947
There will be efficiencies and there will be jobs that would have existed in the absence of this product that won't exist now.
948
So there will be tension, but I don't think, Jason, it translates to mass layoffs.
949
And, you know, we've had this discussion iteratively.
950
I think it'll take a lot more time to adopt.
951
Some companies, especially tech companies, kind of at the very forefront of this, will see significantly reduced hiring.
952
And I saw that LinkedIn executive who posted on, you know, graduate hiring is pretty screwed up right now in part because people aren't sure how many graduates they're going to need in computer science and all this thing.
953
So I do definitely think there's going to be an impact here.
954
I don't think it'll be, quote, mass layoffs.
955
I think it'll be more of a steady grind of 2% or 3% less hiring per year.
956
Tweak at the margin on the organization.
957
You're going to keep trying to move it forward.
958
It's just going to take time.
959
Parna was just what everybody wants to do.
960
They went first.
961
They went to the extreme.
962
But all it is is.
963
The thing we're in consensus in is Jason's kind of articulation of how to manage the messaging here.
964
The messaging from corporate America will be bland with a slight hint of upside on the stock, but not being so direct that it alienates all your employees.
965
That is going to be corporate speak for the next two years.
966
Totally agree.
967
What we don't agree on, you're exactly right, Jason, is it 12 to 15 months, in which case it could be a significant change in terms of employment, or is it my theory, 60 months, five years, in which case it'll be more gradual?
968
Good to go.
969
Okay, so this is Cauchy Quick Fire.
970
Again, Cal She is a prediction market race.
971
Our team freaking love it.
972
And they are always doing this on me every morning.
973
And so they've chosen some of their favorites.
974
Okay.
975
When will OpenAI achieve AGI?
976
Before 2030 or after 2030?
977
That's easy.
978
It'll achieve Open AGI whenever it suits Sam Altman in his negotiations with Microsoft over the Open AGI term in that contract to declare it to be AGI.
979
Because it's a meaningless, ill-defined term that will be used for economic leverage.
980
Go team.
981
That's it.
982
There's two separate, I mean, just stepping back, because maybe listeners don't know.
983
You have the whole big-assed AGI discussion: when will it happen?
984
What does it mean?
985
No one can quite define what it is.
986
No one can quite define what happened.
987
And then, oddly enough, there's a term in the Microsoft OpenAI relationship which now appears to be quite contentious that says, I think, I'm trying to remember when AGI is achieved, I can't remember which way the leverage moves.
988
I'm willing to predict that that term, that will be exploited by one of the two parties to get their, someone now finally has an economic reason to give a shit what open AGI what AGI is and when it can be activated.
989
So my guess is the determination of what it is will be driven by that contract rather than any theoretical BS kind of fear to the world kind of stuff.
990
Listen, I think Elon Musk calls the ball, but he's just always optimistic about when exactly that it's going to launch across all his companies.
991
But he always calls the ball, right?
992
I mean, he founded OpenAI too, right?
993
I mean, the guy's pretty good.
994
All the trillion-dollar-ish ones he founded, right?
995
He said 2026.
996
So what I think, and again, I'm not extra, what I think is it will feel like AGI in 2026, and the really smart guys will agree we're there around 2028.
997
This is just me, I think he's right.
998
He's so good, right?
999
So I'm betting 2026, it feels like it.
1000
In 2028, we agree, unfortunately, we're there, right?
1001
It's a nice one.
1002
It's an over-under.
1003
So I'm not under 2030.
1004
I'm with Jason on that one.
1005
Okay.
1006
Will Trump cut corporate tax this year?
1007
No.
1008
Easy bet if you read the docs.
1009
Basically, if you look at the one big beautiful bill, I can't believe I said that without laughing.
1010
The corporate tax rate was changed permanently in 2017.
1011
So there's no need to touch it now.
1012
It's 21%.
1013
It's not going to be changed.
1014
And I think the current version of the bill doesn't include another change in the corporate tax rate.
1015
There are some minor second-order changes to corporate tax around international taxation, guilty, all the stuff that makes your head hurt when you even try and understand it.
1016
There's no change to taxation rate, and there's no need to, because unlike the personal income tax changes in 2017, the corporate tax was a permanent change.
1017
Yeah, certainly my taxes are, Rory and I taxes are going up, though.
1018
VC's taxes are going way up under the Trump bill because we can't deduct California taxes anymore from federal taxes.
1019
So our taxes are going way up, just like they did under the first Trump.
1020
Under the first Trump, they got rid of salt.
1021
So our taxes went.
1022
So Trump just don't care about California, nor probably should he, right?
1023
Nor probably should he, right?
1024
How much are they going up?
1025
Just for me to know.
1026
A lot.
1027
You'll be fine, Jason.
1028
You'll be fine.
1029
No, no, but it is interesting.
1030
It's just, listen, I'm not into politics, but it is interesting that under both Trump regimes, my taxes have gone way up.
1031
Absolutely.
1032
Way up by Trump, because he doesn't care about California.
1033
If you run the demographics as wealthy inhabitants of New York and California and you look at their voting propensity, I'm sure there was some guy in the House Ways and Means Committee when they realized, ooh, this really sticks to those rich guys on the coast.
1034
It was like, this is the only damn tax cut we're ever going to support.
1035
Let's push it through.
1036
So yeah, I hear you, man.
1037
But what will the taxes go up?
1038
Horori's better than me, 6%?
1039
But that's true.
1040
I don't have a sense of personal idea.
1041
Because the pass-through entity, you'll no longer get a pass-through entity tax deduction in California.
1042
So I think our taxes will go up.
1043
Plus, California is raising it another 1.something percent.
1044
So I think our taxes are going to go up another 7%.
1045
Not that 7% out of the 100%.
1046
Not 7% higher, I'd be cool with it.
1047
It's another 7% we're going to be paying this coming year.
1048
Hooray.
1049
First of all, no one's going to cry for us, and California is still a great place to live.
1050
So we'll figure it out.
1051
Final Cashie quickfire.
1052
When will there be a half-trillionaire?
1053
So someone worth $500 billion?
1054
Will it be before 2026 or after 2026?
1055
I'll take after easily.
1056
I mean, isn't it just tied to how the stock market essentially performs over the next year, right?
1057
If you think the stock market, if you're really bullish on the market, then there's a chance that it happens next year, right?
1058
Will we need to see?
1059
We need to see a return to that double-digit growth rate, right?
1060
I think this, listen, I think this poll is actually pretty good, the 38%.
1061
That's my gut.
1062
What are the odds that we return to the great growth rates overall in NASDAQ that we saw, you know, before this instability?
1063
38% sounds about right, right?
1064
That's what my gut, right?
1065
But I'm making a bet.
1066
I'm actually making the bet it's higher.
1067
I'm all in on the market.
1068
So I'm betting your 2026 number, even though it's not really consistent with reversion to the mean for gains of public equities, right?
1069
We can't have this growth rate forever, can we?
1070
Wow.
1071
One caveat, I thought this was bullshit when we started it a week ago, but now I'm thinking of making a bet on Calci, which just shows how easily it works.
1072
My bet is it's well after 2027 for exactly the reasons you articulated, Jason.
1073
I think it's hard to assume.
1074
Look, from 2010 to this year, it's been an amazing stock market for 15 years.
1075
Now, when you look, it's just hard to extrapolate medium-term, continued same level of growth.
1076
And I think one of the things you learn in the data is it's almost impossible to predict the stock market over one month, six months, 12 months.
1077
But over five or 10 years, the correlation between entry valuation and ultimate return is pretty high.
1078
Entry valuations are high.
1079
So statistically, I mean, Vanguard published great work on this.
1080
Over the next 10 years, your default assumption on the equity return from the United States stocks should be much lower than it's been for the last decade.
1081
If you take that into account, then you're right.
1082
None of these guys, there isn't going to be a half a trillionaire by 2027.
1083
And then they're stopped.
1084
The only caveat to that entire sentence is: the only person who can sprint their way to a half a trillionaire in the middle of the year.
1085
And our ability as private, the ability of the private markup, private, sorry, the private market to mark up investments is as yet untrammeled by any form of reality.
1086
So when you own a slug of SpaceX and you own a slug of X and you own a slug of Twitter, it is entirely plausible that someone gives you such a big step up that you have a paper net worth of north of a half a trillion dollars in the next two or three years.
1087
I don't think Microsoft or any of the public stocks are going to compound your way to the same level.
1088
Final, final one: 646 U.S.
1089
tech unicorns.
1090
How much are actually unicorns in reality?
1091
I thought that was really, that was again from Jason's paper, let's give him credit from the Silicon Valley Bank work on unicorns.
1092
I think the data there says 20 to 30% max.
1093
In other words, which of the meet, if you say you have to be roughly $100 million, roughly growing more than 20% and vaguely at or near profitability, what they were saying is that percentage is mid-high 20s, early 30%.
1094
So yeah, I think that's exactly correct.
1095
And what it means is 70%, and it goes back to the same discussion: 70% of those unicorns aren't worth a billion dollars plus.
1096
They're worth something, but they're sub-100 million, sub-scale, sub-growth, sub-profitability.
1097
So they're probably not worth a billion.
1098
And the overall return from the entire 2.7 trillion of equity will be driven by five or six, not just DecaCorns, but I can't remember what 100 coins is, whatever it is.
1099
Because if they don't compound their way out, the average unicorn ain't going to get you there.
1100
I certainly agree.
1101
What's the question?
1102
The exact question here is going to ask you.
1103
Stays 46.
1104
How many are actually unicorns?
1105
You know, it's worth a billion dollars in hard cash today.
1106
Here's what I'm worried about.
1107
And so 20%.
1108
It's smaller than the markdowns that GPs have taken, right?
1109
The only thing I would say is I'm just, I know we've talked about this.
1110
I hope we do one of these and it changes.
1111
I'm just worried there aren't as many exits for these folks as there should be.
1112
And so I'm worried the number is half.
1113
Whatever the number is, whatever we calculate it to, I'm worried in practice, it's half of that.
1114
When in 2021, it was twice that, right?
1115
Because there's so much liquidity for PE and others, right?
1116
Jason, you're exactly right, which is why it's this quantity, 646, and then you circle back to two good IPOs.
1117
Let's say we had two good IPOs a week for the next year.
1118
That's 100 good exits, right?
1119
If they were all going to make it, that would take six years to clear the total balance of unicorns.
1120
It just brings it home.
1121
There will be some value from this.
1122
But the bar on exits that's now knowable and achievable is $2,300 million plus 30% growth.
1123
It's a relatively small number of the 646 and the herd that's going to make that.
1124
The only thing I would say, in 2021, at the peak, we had an IPO a day.
1125
So if the revenue, like clearly the markets can absorb it, right?
1126
So if these companies all reflated to growth, we've already done this, right?
1127
2021 was, it sounds crazy today, it was an IPO a day.
1128
In 2021, it was an IPO a day.
1129
You couldn't even keep up.
1130
It's a great point.
1131
TechFrench said in 2021, we won't even cover companies at a billion.
1132
It has to be $2 billion and up to write a post, right?
1133
It was so crazy, right?
1134
That's actually an excellent point.
1135
I shouldn't have throttled it at two a week.
1136
Two a week would be great.
1137
Yeah.
1138
If the appetite comes back, which is why it's really good that both of these companies are performing.
1139
If the appetite comes back, more of them can go public.
1140
It isn't a question of is the liquidity there.
1141
It isn't a question of is the ability of bankers to get transactions done.
1142
To your point, Jason, the real question is: how many of that 646 meet the new profile of 200 million plus, 30% growth, and profitable?
1143
And that's where the culling of the herd will take place.
1144
Boys, I always love this.
1145
You have been fantastic.
1146
Thank you so much for joining me.
1147
It's slightly earlier, also.
1148
God, I love you, Californians, doing early mornings.
1149
Okay, get back to Jason's point.
1150
We work over here, dude.
1151
Sorry, that was me.
1152
You're a traitor.
1153
You're a traitor.
1154
You're Irish.
1155
How could you do this?
1156
You mean leave England?
1157
Let me explain.
1158
I could give you 800 years of history and explain why, but let's not, we don't have time for that, Howie.
1159
I can do it just fine.
1160
Oh, we miss you in the UK.
1161
We miss you.
1162
That's a longer subject.
1163
I know you don't.
1164
Boys, you're amazing.
1165
Thank you so much.
1166
Take care.
1167
All right, Rockon.
1168
I've said it once.
1169
I'll say it again.
1170
Those are my favorite shows to record.
1171
Rory is a master.
1172
Jason is a friend.
1173
We just have such a good time doing it.
