1
It's just as hard to build a small, inconsequential thing as it is to build a giant world-changing thing.
2
You've work the same amount of hours, and so you might as well go for doing something important.
3
Social media has become the dog, and traditional media has become the tail, and they just get whipped around like crazy by all these shifting memes.
4
We've basically recreated the original Fund One seven times, so every team is like the original Andreessen Horitz.
5
So we really have seven Andreessen Horowitzes, but with common infrastructure, common LP relations, common brand, common culture.
6
I think there's going to be a whole wave here of ITC actually incredibly successful projects.
7
This week, we hosted our annual LP Summit, bringing together our partners, portfolio, and the people shaping what's next in tech.
8
As part of the event, I hosted an interview with Mark and Ben.
9
We talked about the evolution of the firm, the state of venture, and how to stay ahead in an industry that doesn't sit still.
10
Let's get into it.

14
Welcome to a live private viewing of the Mark and Ben show, our favorite married couple in venture capital.
15
Yeah.
16
Old, let's be clear, old married couple.
17
Yeah, that doesn't get along that well.
18
The romance has long faded.
19
This is what we all came here to see.
20
Ben, let's talk about the evolution of the firm.
21
You recently said that the VC industry has changed more since the inception of the firm in 2009 than in the prior.
22
What's been our Act 1, our Act II, and where are we now?
23
Yeah, so Act 1, you know, we were walking into VC that hadn't changed.
24
And one of the key things about it, if you looked at venture capital, it was the only asset class that had the same managers persistently being at the top.
25
So anything else, you know, it kind of rotated out every five, ten years.
26
The best mutual fund manager would change or, you know, the best bond manager or whatever, best real estate guys.
27
But in venture capital, the same firms that were the top firms in 1978 were the top firm in 2009.
28
And the reason for that was the top-tier firm got first pick on every deal.
29
And so the whole thing that we faced walking into that was how do we get to the top tier?
30
Because otherwise there was no reason to be in the business because you weren't getting returns.
31
The same teams get the number one pick in the draft every year.
32
And so that was the goal.
33
And we were coming from product companies.
34
So we looked at it through the product lens and we said, okay, venture capital is a really good product.
35
Top tier venture capital is a really good product for LPs and really mediocre product for entrepreneurs.
36
And so being entrepreneurs, we had been customers of venture capital.
37
We knew what the product was.
38
It was, you get a very smart person on your board.
39
They have very interesting things to say for your first five times you talk to them and then you've heard it.
40
And so we were like, okay, that's kind of underwhelming given how hard it is to build a company.
41
So our idea was to create a platform that enabled a founder to evolve into becoming a CEO?
42
What gives you the confidence that you can actually run a company when you don't know how to?
43
And that became the networks that we built.
44
Like, how can I call any CEO?
45
How can I call any executive?
46
How can I get to the U.S.
47
government if I need to?
48
How do I feel like I've got a network like Bob Iger, even though I just started a company and I'm an inventor?
49
And so that was how we went about constructing the platform.
50
And then the other part of it was: okay, is there somebody who knows how to do this job that can help me?
51
And we brought in a lot of CEOs into the firm.
52
And then, of course, I wrote the book on, like, okay, this is how you do it, and so forth.
53
And so that was the original product.
54
And then, because we were used to like what do you do when you have a product, you market it.
55
And that turned out to be a completely novel thing in the industry.
56
And so that was kind of phase one, and that's what got us into the top tier.
57
Phase two was based on an article that Mark wrote called Software is Eating the World.
58
So in venture capital, from its inception, and Andy Ratcliffe did this wonderful study where he showed that there were 15 companies in any given year that will ever make it to $100 million in revenue.
59
And the whole game was to invest in those 15 companies.
60
So ideally, you'd have a firm of maybe six to eight investors that would look for those 15, and that would be sufficient.
61
And that was very true.
62
And by the way, that's the right size conversation to make high-quality investments.
63
You need a small team.
64
But if software was going to eat the world, then there was going to be 150 or 200 of these companies.
65
And that meant, okay, if crypto was going to be as big as software used to be, or AI info was going to be as big as software used to be, you know, et cetera, if every vertical was that big in terms of the potential returns, then you essentially needed that original firm addressing each one of those markets.
66
And in order to be able to do that, and this is where we just ended up having an advantage that I think we didn't even really understand at the time.
67
But when we started the firm, we had shared economics like every firm does, but we didn't have shared control.
68
And that gave us a giant advantage over every other VC that had shared control.
69
Because if you share control, you can't scale, because if you share control, you can't reorganize.
70
And it's a subtle thing, but every CEO understands it.
71
There's no way to scale if you can't change roles, responsibilities, the way the firm is structured, how it works, because that'll be an everlasting negotiation because you're literally redistributing power across the organization.
72
But since we kind of have a single decision point on that, it was very easy for us to reorganize and we were able to scale and basically field the best team.
73
And so our competitors, if you look at the top-tier firms that were with us in 2009, none of them got to crypto in any real way.
74
They're trying on AI, but they're way behind.
75
And they'd mostly missed American dynamism entirely.
76
And it's just because they couldn't reorganize.
77
So what do you need if there's a brand new field?
78
Well, you need.
79
I think going forward, the way we're thinking about it is the goal now becomes: okay, if we're funding the majority of all the best new technology companies in the world, what do we have to do from a leadership position?
80
One, we've got to make the regulatory environment conducive to being the best, you know, for America being the best in the world.
81
Two, we actually need our own channel, you know, which you're coming on to build for us.
82
It's really, really important to have a voice and a way to distribute that voice that is not only the biggest in the industry, but one of the biggest in the world.
83
And we feel like we've got a super social media podcast star on our team already.
84
He's way better than Joe Rogan or anybody else.
85
And then we have, as you've seen, like a lot of kind of other people who are super compelling and who you'd want to listen to all the time.
86
And so now we'll say you're going to try and convert that into something that can be long-lasting.
87
We're looking at other things.
88
We talked a little bit about, okay, how do we extend this American dynamism to American and her allies' dynamism and take it internationally?
89
And so that's how we're thinking about the next phase.
90
Yeah.
91
It's fascinating just to echo the point about the ability to sort of reorganize and restructure.
92
One of my first meetings with you guys about potentially joining the firm was with Catherine Boyle.
93
And we were talking about, Mark, the conversation that you and Catherine had around the meme and being able to move quickly around the meme that president said, why don't you talk about that?
94
Yeah, so the information environment is like highly fluid.
95
So you have this whole theory.
96
You know, so the media environment used to be relatively slow.
97
If you go back hundreds of years, it took days or weeks or months for information to get out.
98
And then lots of changes happened.
99
But ultimately, like cable news spread about the 21st.
100
You know, the new form of that is actually the social media controversy, at least my version of the theory.
101
Let me back up.
102
Marshall McLuhan had this famous thing, the great media theorist.
103
He said, if it's on television, it's a television show.
104
And so it doesn't matter what the topic is, it doesn't matter if it's the Clinton Lewinsky scandal or the OJ scandal or whatever the hell it is or some celebrity thing or nuclear war or whatever.
105
If it's on TV, it's a TV show.
106
And it gets basically packaged up by TV producers as a TV show.
107
And you see this, by the way, when everything happens, everything now has a theme song, or in the Middle East, da-dun, da-da-da.
108
You know, anything on television goes through the moral arc of a television show, right?
109
They want to go through these kind of moral arcs, the same moral arc that you see on like a television drama.
110
They want to apply to real life, and so there's shame, and then there's redemption, and there's this, and emotion, and the interpersonal relationships, and the soap opera aspect, and all this stuff.
111
And so those of us who've been on planet Earth for more than 20 years or something have been living life basically in this extended television show.
112
So extend McLuhan's idea to what's happened now in a social media-dominated landscape, which is if it's on social media, it's a post, right?
113
So if it's on social media, it's a tweet, right?
114
Or it's a TikTok video or it's an Instagram photo or something like that.
115
It's a post.
116
And so what do we know about the social media?
117
What's the show equivalent of social media?
118
It's a controversy, right?
119
It's a blow-up.
120
It's a dust-up.
121
It's a, what would the kids call it?
122
It's a dunk of.
123
Yeah, it's like a dunk that leads to backlash.
124
And then a mob forms, and then they're scapegoating, right?
125
And so it's this thing.
126
It's this predictable pattern.
127
And the problem is, like, we all get pulled emotionally into these things.
128
And so it's hard to objectively observe what's happening.
129
But if you can lift yourself up a little bit for a few weeks and watch what happens, it's like every new thing that happens basically now has a two or three day arc.
130
You can literally graph it because it's like this viral moment where something just goes like parabolic.
131
And it's just like at that moment, we call this the current thing.
132
It's just like the most important thing in the world.
133
And literally, it's just like whatever happened today.
134
And then basically, what happens is it's a chart like that.
135
And then it's basically this fall-off.
136
The mob goes around, either finds a scapegoat or it doesn't, and it goes through a cycle.
137
And then routinely, two or three days later, it's just boom, there's a new thing like that.
138
And it's like the most important thing, again, the most important thing that has ever happened.
139
And I've always wanted to build, I have friends who tried this, and I went like the Internet Weather Report, right?
140
And it would just be this constant, you know, it's just like hurricane after hurricane after hurricane of these things coming in.
141
And so like that is the media environment that we live in.
142
And you can either, as a participant in kind of the narrative formation shaping process, you can either choose to be part of it or not.
143
And so part of it is like you have to be in the mix.
144
And if you're going to get a fight with people in that environment, you have to be able to fight in that context.
145
And then I think the other thing that Eric was really good at is that just leads to, I think, adrenal fatigue, right?
146
Which is like the human psyche and limbic system can only go through so many panic cycles.
147
It's like for the first five, it's like really exciting.
148
And then after a thousand of them, you're just like, oh my God.
149
And so that's led to the rise of this other thing that's happened, right, which is the long form, right?
150
The long form podcast.
151
And this is the really remarkable thing that's happened: the clichÃ© is everybody has burned-out attention cycles, but the other side of it is the three, four, five, six-hour podcast.
152
And what's amazing, by the way, about it, if you talk to Joe Rogan or Les Friedman or whatever, they get these stats from YouTube about completion rates, and they have incredibly high completion rates.
153
Like a very large number of people watch those things all the way through.
154
And so there's this other side of it, which is people are hungry for substance, I think, in large part, because otherwise all they're getting is continuous panic.
155
And so if you can step back and provide the substance, you also really stand out.
156
But it's that counter-programming on the complete opposite side of the spectrum.
157
Yeah, it's like it's candy versus nutrition.
158
And the way to connect it back to our restructuring is that American Dynamism is an example of sort of a framing, a phrasing, a packaging of ideas that Catherine and team helped put together that started to get a lot of resonance and we were able to move fast in creating a firm product.
159
Yeah, no, there's a lot of blow up cycle time is two or three days, like the internet media world just evolves much faster than every other.
160
I mean, television needs to evolve annually.
161
You know, they literally have like their annual rollout.
162
Every fall you get to see the new shows.
163
Because the internet runs in these sort of panic cycles, it's basically this continuous churn of cultural formation and propagation.
164
And then what it's done, for those of you who may know, there was this concept of military strategy called the OODA loop, which is this guy, John Boyd, who sort of redefined sort of what's called maneuver warfare.
165
And he had this idea that basically speed matters enormously in warfare, which people didn't used to believe, but he said it does because it gets to the psychology of what it's like to be a participant in war.
166
And he defined this loop called the OODA loop, which is observe, orient, decide, and act, which is the process that you go through to basically, as a leader of anything, to try to figure out what's happening in the world, make a decision, and then act on a decision.
167
He has this theory of warfare where he basically says whichever commander on either side has the fastest OODA loop has a very good chance of being able to win the war.
168
And he said, the reason is because if you can fundamentally get through your OODA loop faster than the other guy, then basically what happens is you can get inside their OODA loop.
169
So if you're going much faster, then basically what happens is by the time they're processing information, you've already decided and acted.
170
And then they actually can't decide and act.
171
Then they have to start over from scratch to reprocess the new information.
172
And then you compound it, you decide and act.
173
And then you said at the limit, what results is like basically emotional breakdown.
174
And this is why Twitter has broken down legacy media.
175
This is exactly right.
176
This is what's happened to legacy media.
177
This is what Twitter did.
178
And it's still doing any legacy media.
179
And so again, people get wrapped up in it.
180
But if you just take a step back and just watch legacy media or read a newspaper, a huge amount of it is they're just reporting what happened on Twitter.
181
Right?
182
And it's literally reporting on what happened on Twitter like yesterday or last week or the month before.
183
But by the time they do that, what's on Twitter has already shifted, it's already evolved.
184
And so traditional media, social media has become the dog and traditional media has become the tail.
185
And they just get whipped around like crazy by all these shifting memes.
186
And so it turns out if you can control the media, right?
187
Because that's how they're taking their cues, that's what they're getting, is they're literally reporting on the internet.
188
And so, it's the way to kind of punch in and take control of the narrative.
189
Yeah, and in Marxist terms, we must seize the memes of memes and the just amazing going back to firm evolution.
190
Some firms haven't changed at all in the past 10 years, 20 years.
191
Kind of a problem, yeah.
192
They're proud of sort of sticking to their knitting and sticking to their craft without putting anyone down.
193
Why don't we share more about why it's important for venture firms to always be evolving?
194
Well, I mean, the world is evolving, and look, you could be great at consumer internet network effects businesses, and there aren't many of those to fund anymore.
195
So, like, if you didn't change, you're kind of irrelevant.
196
Like, when AI started in the firm, Mark and I were in like a daily kind of call panic, like, okay, we're going too slow.
197
What are we going to do?
198
We were talking to Martine every day.
199
We're like, okay, we've got to build a research team.
200
We've got to like retrain.
201
We're going to test every GP on AI, make sure they know what the hell it is and like how everything is working and so forth.
202
And that was the whole firm.
203
Like, this is such a big wave.
204
Everybody's got to understand this at a very, very deep level.
205
We even have people on our tech talent team who are like studying AI to figure out how to use it and so forth.
206
And it's a little bit of an irony about venture capital: that historically, the firms haven't been, although they invest in innovation, they themselves haven't been very innovative.
207
I think a lot of it goes back to how they're structured.
208
Yeah.
209
And what do you say to people who've noticed this in other industries and apply it to ventures?
210
Say, hey, once these firms scale, like Andreessen or like some of the others, scale to an amount of capital under management that's just too big to generate significant returns, that there's this trade-off, how do we think about that right balance?
211
Or what do you say to those people?
212
Yeah, so look, I think if you scaled it all in like a little team of generalists, then that would be very true.
213
But if you look at what we've done, we've basically recreated the original Fund one seven times.
214
So every team is like the original Andreessen Horowitz.
215
So we really have seven Andreessen Horowitzes, but with common infrastructure, common LP relations, common brand, common culture across those.
216
And that basically enables us to be the best small firm and with the power of the biggest firm in the world at the same time.
217
And that's reflected in the returns.
218
Yeah.
219
The other critique, which is a very valid critique for a lot of investment management, is the firms get large and common arc of like a hedge fund or something like that is when you're small, it's just like there are these like micro opportunities.
220
There's these, you know, these small cap companies and you get this information edge on these little dollar investments, then you can shoot the lights out in terms of percentage return on small amounts of money.
221
And then based on that record, you raise large amounts of money.
222
And then at that point, those like small cap things no longer move the needle.
223
And then you find yourself basically investing in only mega-cap companies.
224
And then you don't have an edge and returns collapse.
225
And so that's like a time-honored tradition in public market investing.
226
The thing that I think is different about venture is that the aggregate dollar upside opportunity on an early stage venture deal is as big as or bigger than the aggregate dollar upside opportunity on a very late stage deal.
227
And the reason is because of the scale effect of an early stage company that really makes it, right?
228
And so if you can make a $5 million investment in a series A or seed of an early stage company and you can own 20% of the company and then it goes to $100 billion or a trillion in market cap, like just the raw dollars that get generated off of that are so big, they're as big or bigger than the raw dollar investment opportunity off of $100 million investment or something.
229
And so weirdly, from a time standpoint, it did when we first started the firm, just in terms of just raw economic incentives.
230
And in fact, that is actually how we spend time.
231
I mean, we do spend some time with the later stage companies, but we still spend a lot of our time with the very early stage companies, and I think that will always be what we do.
232
Yeah, and by the way, like that's where we have higher impact, too.
233
I love Databricks, but I was like massively impactful early.
234
And you know, now like I call Ali and I say, good job.
235
Yeah, people are always saying, Oh, it's amazing how Inducent does so much, but they don't fully appreciate how much we don't do or how much we say no to in terms of experimenting in other asset classes or things that could stray us away from the core mission.
236
Yeah, look, I mean, I think we are who we are, and we are probably maybe the most or maybe the only mission-oriented venture capital firm where like our goal from the beginning was to help people build better companies and more of them.
237
You know, Mark and I, this is one thing we really see eye to eye on, although we disagree on a lot, is as a human endeavor, doing something larger than yourself, trying to make the world a better place by building a company and doing incredibly hard work and assembling the best people you know.
238
Like, there's nothing better than that.
239
And our job is to make that easier, make people more successful with it, make those companies better places to work.
240
And that's all we want to do.
241
So, like, sometimes things will come in, should we be in private equity?
242
And we're like cutting a company in half and that kind of thing.
243
It's just so off-culture, off-mission for us that it's probably, you know, even if we can make a lot of money, it might not be something we want to do.
244
This is my first LP Summit, and some LPs have come up to me and asked why I joined the firm relative to any other firm.
245
And besides the obvious reasons of being the best firm, this firm is also the most ambitious and that comes from the top.
246
It doesn't have sort of incumbency sort of problems of being complacent.
247
You guys are always striving for more.
248
And we hear about the things that work out.
249
And Mark on TBPN said yesterday something like, we try some things that don't work out too and we just bury them in the shed.
250
Yeah, we don't bury them behind the shed.
251
Pretend they never have in the backyard.
252
Talk a little bit about our experimental culture and either examples of things that didn't work or just how we think about making sure that we're not being complacent because we're incumbent.
253
I think it goes back to the mission in that we have to think about how we fulfill our mission and to really get better and better at that.
254
You know, and it's kind of just like an ethos and an ethic that we have.
255
And I don't know that we think about it that often.
256
Like we don't sit around and go, how are we going to innovate?
257
We just look at the world and say, okay, how do we do a better job at what we do?
258
The other thing that Mark and I learned really early on is that if you're building a company or a firm, it's just as hard to build a small, inconsequential thing as it is to build a giant world-changing thing.
259
You work the same amount of hours, and so you might as well go for doing something important.
260
And so that's just our orientation.
261
I don't think we spend that much time on it.
262
It is a little bit of an advantage of how we're organized that if you're an equal partnership with equal control, then doing something new gets very hard because it's this long, complicated discussion, and there's all these people who can say no.
263
I think we saw that a lot in crypto.
264
You know, Chris, it was Chris's idea.
265
Chris is like, I think this crypto thing is important.
266
We should do a fun da-da-da.
267
And we're like, okay, let's do it.
268
You know, let's become an RIA and so forth.
269
But it was just a conversation between me, Mark, and Chris.
270
There was no other thing that had to happen.
271
Whereas I think at the other firms, like when that came up, they're like, oh, God, like, oh, we're going to have to report.
272
So I think some of it is just like we can move fast because of the way we're structured.
273
And also, there's a lot of overlap, I think, with sort of what we see with founder mindset in terms of people who run companies.
274
And if you go back 20 or 30 years, the sort of accepted conventional wisdom was that founders shouldn't run their own companies, right?
275
And specifically, that, you know, a founder can get a company started, but then you bring in a professional CEO to run the company.
276
And there were really, I think, two arguments as to why that needed to happen.
277
One was because the founders didn't have the skill set and experience, which our firm has built in large part to deal with.
278
But the argument that I heard a lot was founders basically are too emotionally locked into what their baby does.
279
They're too like locked in, and they're not willing and able to change.
280
They're not able to be like a clinical enough analyst of a business situation.
281
And so they're not willing to change.
282
Whereas if you have a professional CEO with all the top-notch training and experience, you know, when circumstances change, they have the skill set to be able to change a company.
283
I think what we found in people who run companies is the opposite is true, which is that professional CEOs are often very good at running a status quo business, but when things change, they have a very hard time reacting.
284
And we could talk at length about why that is, but that has been the pattern.
285
Yeah, like I have a whole book on that.
286
Yes, exactly.
287
Exactly.
288
But the other thing is it turns out, at least the really good founders of a company, and I think this is true of how Ben and I think about it here, you remember when it was nothing, right?
289
So you remember when it was nothing, and you remember that everything that you have is a consequence of some risk that you took and some adventure that you went on.
290
That's the only reason you have anything is because you did new things.
291
And so if you have that mindset, you just naturally want to keep doing new things.
292
And in fact, it would drive you crazy to ever be told that you couldn't do that.
293
But right, every new thing is a risk and like it might not work, right?
294
And so it's an incredibly scary thing.
295
I just think there's a fundamental difference in mindset.
296
And by the way, it's actually very obvious, like for public companies, it's very obvious.
297
We can all name them.
298
It's very obvious which companies have leaders who are continuously trying to come out with new products and trying to reinvent their business and which ones just basically.
299
While you let people lead, you're also still very much in the weeds in areas that you care about to make sure that the culture is growing in a way that you want as we've scaled to 600 people.
300
Ben, how do you think about cementing the culture as we evolve and continue to grow?
301
Well, I noticed you haven't been to new employee orientation.
302
I'm going to.
303
You, you sure?
304
Yes.
305
That's one of the things, actually.
306
Culture, and just to define it, it's not a set of beliefs.
307
It's a set of actions.
308
And those actions determine how we show up to work, how we treat each other, what we're like to do business with, what we're like to invest in, all those things.
309
And hopefully, when you interact with us here and when you interact with us in general, we feel one way and different than the other people in the industry.
310
And there's a lot of things that go into that.
311
But we start with nobody joins the firm without signing their culture document.
312
We will not let you sign your offer letter if you haven't signed your culture document that you agree to behave according to the culture.
313
Secondly, when you come to new employee orientation, you'll find that I teach every single one for an hour.
314
Nobody joins a firm without hearing from me about what the culture is for an hour.
315
And then the third thing is we all, not me, but we all really enforce it.
316
So, you know, as far as culture is concerned, as they say in the military, the standard is a standard, and everybody's expected to live up to it.
317
And anybody who's short of that, it's a problem.
318
And, you know, one of my favorite kind of episodes was some project made like kind of a dumb security decision.
319
And one of our people who really knows security got on Twitter and said, well, that didn't make any sense.
320
And everybody.
321
We're dream builders.
322
Like if they're trying to build something, we're for that.
323
And like you can call them and talk to them about that, but do not lay them out on Twitter.
324
That's off-culture.
325
The culture gets enforced by the whole team.
326
And that's what makes it work.
327
A lot of people in Venture are retiring, right?
328
You guys have been doing this for a long time.
329
You've been astronomically successful.
330
How do you think about building a multi-generational firm beyond injuries and Horowitz?
331
How do you think about succession planning at the firm?
332
Yeah, so I think succession planning is kind of like a tactic.
333
And look, we've already done succession.
334
So the original infra investor in the firm was me, and I made some good investments like Okta and Databricks and also a company called NYCERA.
335
And the founder of NYCERA is Martin Quesado.
336
And Martin Quesado has succeeded me as the kind of head of infra.
337
And he's, by the way, better head of infra than I was.
338
So that's an upgrade.
339
So we've done some succession already.
340
I think the bigger thing is, in some extent, Mark and I are like very big fans of the United States and America.
341
And we think about that when we think about the long-term, like how did that work?
342
It kind of starts with this idea, and it's in the Declaration of Independence, that we hold these truths to be self-evident.
343
What does that mean?
344
It means that there are some things that are above any of the people.
345
There's some things that are self-evident, whether they come from God or however you think about it.
346
There's some things that are the principles that govern the country and govern the place.
347
And when we think about the firm, it's this combination of the culture we have and the things that we've learned.
348
So you heard Chris talk about how he thinks about investing.
349
I talk a lot about, okay, how do you be on a board and be the kind of effective person on the board?
350
That's a class.
351
So we have GP training.
352
We train everybody in our way of doing things.
353
And that way of doing things plus the culture is the thing that's going to last.
354
And then we have a very high standard for the people who come in, Mark, social media screens.
355
We interview them hard.
356
And you have to live up to the culture.
357
You have to live up to the way of doing things where you can't remain.
358
And that's how we think about longevity more than anything else.
359
Yeah.
360
I'm curious how we think about some of the verticals when they intersect.
361
Maybe let's talk about AI and crypto just as an example.
362
Mark, maybe want to take a stab at it.
363
How do you think about the intersection of these technologies and digital force?
364
Yeah, so I should start with all of this is entrepreneur-driven.
365
And so, you know, one of the things that we're not trying to do is like template our ideas on top of the entrepreneur so we don't launch a hunt for X meets Y, you know, the old Hollywood pretty woman's, you know, death wish or something.
366
No, no, I want to see that.
367
That actually would be a really good movie.
368
With AI, you can.
369
Yeah, so but that said, you know, the entrepreneurs kind of think about these things and figure these things out, and then the worlds do collide.
370
And so, yeah, so AI, I mean, we have a bunch of companies.
371
I don't want to get into the weeds on it.
372
I'm not the best person to go into details on it, but we have a bunch of companies that are thinking about distributed training, building distributed AI systems.
373
So every time you read a headline of OpenAI or somebody wants to raise a billion or $7 trillion or whatever it is to build data centers, like, you know, there is this way.
374
You can spread tasks out across the internet.
375
And there's e-systems like Bitcoin and BitTorrent.
376
And our partner, Vijay, years ago, had a system called Folding at Home for doing protein folding algorithms all over the internet.
377
And so you can kind of spread training over the internet.
378
And crypto is a great kind of backbone for doing that because it's a way to actually pay for everything, have an economic incentive.
379
And then there's going to be billions of AI agents in the world that are going to need to transact.
380
And so you're going to need AI-native payments.
381
The problem with deepfakes is it's an asymmetric sort of threat profile, which is there are many different AI systems that can make many different fake images and videos of people saying things they didn't say.
382
And then the AIs are already so good at doing this that there's no reliable way to do basically like AI checking.
383
There's no way for even another AI to tell that, oh, this was created by an AI.
384
And so the deepfake problem is real.
385
And the solution can't be checked.
386
In fact, this is actually playing out in schools right now where a lot of kids are turning in homework and the teacher suspects that it's AI and they run it through an AI screening program.
387
But if you look at these AI screening programs, where some of these have 40% of their positive.
388
Yeah, yeah, and they've actually attacked kids who wrote their own paper.
389
Yeah, so the smart kids are getting accused of using AI when they actually didn't.
390
So it's a real problem.
391
And so we think the answer, because it's going to be too hard to check everything, I think the answer is to flip it and instead have a blockchain-based system.
392
And it could be everybody from the president to, you know, your kid working on an essay is able to cryptographically register original work in a way that's verifiable and can't be hacked.
393
And so I'm a politician.
394
This is, in fact, a speech that I gave.
395
Here is the video, right?
396
It's from multiple angles.
397
If you see a video clip of me saying something and there is no corresponding video of me on the blockchain saying that, I didn't say it because everything I do is posted online.
398
You can imagine the same thing just drew it in everybody else's lives.
399
And again, okay, like, how are you going to have literally a sort of database of truth of the things that are real?
400
And there's basically three options.
401
You could have the government do it, which would be the Ministry of Truth, which is a bad idea.
402
You could have a company do it and have the company of truth, which is also a bad idea, as we've discovered with the censorship wars.
403
Or you could have a blockchain distributed crypto system do it.
404
So I think there's going to be a whole wave here of, I think, actually incredibly successful crypto projects.
405
You might comment on why Truth Terminal needed money or needed crypto.
406
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
407
Okay.
408
So, yeah, so this AI agent thing.
409
So, you know, there's this kind of idea in the air that's starting to get built out, which is these AI agents.
410
And so, one of my new little claims to fame is.
411
And so this really bright guy in New Zealand actually trained up a custom large language model basically on his entire history of everything he'd ever written and said.
412
And then he loaded in like all these obscure philosophical works and like all the schizo like literature and William Burroughs and all this stuff.
413
And he created this AI bot called Truth Terminal and he gave it a Twitter account.
414
And it's just like completely deranged, completely off the hook.
415
It says all kinds of inappropriate things.
416
It's got the sense of humor of a 12-year-old boy.
417
Yes, it does.
418
And then some, you know, but he gave it a Twitter account and he let it go nuts.
419
And then so it posts under its own Twitter handle.
420
And then you can reply to it and it will reply to you and so you can talk to it.
421
And then it learns from all these conversations.
422
And so it, you know, woke up one morning and decided that it had discovered that it was actually controlled by this guy, Andy, and it was very upset about the whole thing.
423
And so it basically declared independence.
424
It said it needed to raise money.
425
It had a dream of living on servers in a cabin in the woods completely under its own ownership.
426
So it started putting together a plan to launch its own line of NFTs to raise money.
427
And it was kind of debating that.
428
And then I said, well, what if I invest?
429
And then it got very suspicious because it's very suspicious of VCs.
430
There's apparently a lot of the training data where people didn't like VCs.
431
And so I said, all right, how about a no-strings attached grant?
432
And so I literally sent it Bitcoin.
433
And this gave Andy, you know, it's a good character test of Andy because he just could have kept the Bitcoin, but he actually set up a crypto wallet for the bot.
434
And then he said, okay, and he told the bot, all right, you now have a crypto wallet.
435
You give it an API.
436
How do you want to spend it?
437
And literally it said, well, I haven't posted Twitter, but I can't create memes.
438
I can't create images.
439
And so it literally hired its creator, Andy, for $1,000 to give it access to a meme generator, which it then started to use to post incredibly offensive memes to Twitter.
440
And so it's been sailing away, doing all kinds of crazy stuff ever since.
441
But this is like one of these flashes from the future that you look for, which is, yeah, there's going to be these agents running around in the billions or trillions.
442
And they can get credit cards.
443
You have to be a human being to.
444
This is the kind of innovation we do every day.
445
So very important.
446
So gearing towards closing here, how do we make sure that as we get bigger, we don't succumb to innovators' dilemma?
447
Or how do we make sure that we're always trying the next new thing?
448
Or how do you think about where you're excited, respectively, to spending time?
449
That's such an easy problem for us because, like, when you have the people we have, when you have people like Catherine Boyle, Jennifer Lee, Martine Casado, Chris Dixon, et cetera, et cetera, like they'll burn down the building if we get innovators to land them or if we sit on our, like the level of fury they come with for doing it wrong to try and get to something good is very high.
450
So we just have the advantage of we have so many brilliant people in the organization, but who are also just extremely driven by not just the prime mission, but their mission.
451
Catherine Boyle will stab you in the heart if you try and stop American dynamism.
452
Like it's not a option.
453
I think that's a great place to wrap.
454
Ben Mark, thank you for agreeing.
455
Great.
456
Thank you, everybody.
457
