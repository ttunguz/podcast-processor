1
Something I speak about frequently on Invest Like the Best is the idea of life's work.
2
A more fun way to think about it is that I'm looking for maniacs on a mission.
3
This is the basis for our investment firm Positive Sum, and it's the reason why I'm so enthusiastic about our presenting sponsor, RAMP.
4
Not only are the founders, Kareem and Eric, life's work-level founders, certainly maniacs on a mission, they have created a product that is effectively an unlock for founders and finance team to do more of their life's work by streamlining financial operations, saving everyone their most precious resource, time.
5
RAMP has built a command and control system for corporate cards and expense management.
6
You can issue cards, manage approvals, make vendor payments of all kinds, and even automate closing your books all in one place.
7
Speaking from my own experience using RAMP for my business, the product is wildly intuitive, simplistic, and makes life so much easier that you'll feel bad for any company who hasn't yet made the switch.
8
The RAMP team is relentless, and the product continues to evolve to save you time that you would never have dreamed of getting back.
9
To me, there is nothing more interesting than technologies that reduce friction for other entrepreneurs to be able to build the thing that they want to.
10
So much attention has gone to cloud computing, APIs, and other ways of making life easy for founders.
11
What RAMP has done and is doing is build yet another set of tools in this category.

My guest today is John Zito.
46
John is the co-president of Apollo Global Management.
47
In our conversation, he shares how they quietly built one of the most important financial institutions of our time, originating over $250 billion annually.
48
John's thesis on the convergence of private and public markets and Apollo's positioning to capture 100% of client portfolios rather than just alternative allocations offers a fascinating glimpse into where institutional investing is heading.
49
We discuss the cultural and strategic elements that drive John, Apollo's merger with Athene, the idea of artistry at scale, and the evolution of capital markets.
50
Please enjoy my conversation with John Zito.
51
John, I've been really excited to do this with you.
52
Me too.
53
The main reason I'm excited is I don't cover this style of investing all that much, credit.
54
Apollo is one of the emerging most important financial institutions.
55
I don't think people appreciate how it works.
56
And to set it up properly, I would love you to talk about the stakes as you see them in capital markets today, because just the whole world of capital markets, which has been one way, very U.S.
57
dominated for a very long time, is shifting around.
58
And it's not going to move fast, but it's changing and it's really important.
59
And I think you have a very unique seat to see not only through Apollo, but just the whole global capital markets picture.
60
And I would just love you to give a state of the union on what you think matters and why.
61
First off, thank you for the comments.
62
I think I go back to the beginning of my career when loans were not even going to be something that traded and all of a sudden they were all on bank balance sheets and people thought it was just complete lunacy that you would trade a loan.
63
And today you're issuing 500 billion of CLOs today.
64
I worked my first job out of college.
65
I sat on a trading desk and the guy next to me was launching a $5 million credit hedge fund.
66
And I used to get in early.
67
I didn't even know what a bond was.
68
And I would read up and down I was reverse commuting to Greenwich and I was learning the difference between bid, ask, yield, how to calculate bond yield all on my own.
69
I went to Amherst College and it wasn't really a finance heavy education.
70
It was much more about thinking outside the box and being much more liberal arts education.
71
All learn on the job and he ended up hiring me as a second employee to start this hedge fund.
72
And in 2002, 2003, he ended up raising a billion four.
73
A guy named Jim Casper, who had run Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's high-yield business for a long time and J.H.
74
Whitney's high-yield business for a long time.
75
But a billion four was massive in credit, just massive.
76
The whole ecosystem of alternatives and going into institutional products, and it was such a new thing.
77
And the design of the CDS market, very new.
78
The design of index products, very new.
79
And this isn't that long ago.
80
That was 22, 23 years ago.
81
And you look at today, we're just under $800 billion asset manager.
82
A vast majority of our capital is in credit.
83
We're growing at $150 billion a year.
84
We're writing anywhere between a billion to $2 billion of annuities per week.
85
We originated $260 billion of investment-grade product last year, investment-grade and private asset product last year.
86
The scale is crazy and hard for people to believe, but it's been a complete retooling of the way that capital markets even function.
87
What we're trying to build is probably something that, first off, no one's really tried before.
88
For us, we have this very large traditional asset manager.
89
A traditional asset manager is: okay, we take your money, we invest it the best of our ability, we take some sort of fee, but it's not our money, we're investing your money.
90
And three years ago, we really said we think the future of asset management is being aligned with our clients in a way that no one else is.
91
So we merged with our insurance retirement service company called Athene.
92
And with that, we brought on close to half our balance sheet, just over $300 billion today of our own balance sheet, which we're investing every day, 95% investment grade, 5% alternatives.
93
We'll write an annuity at 4% or 5%.
94
We'll invest that money at 6.5%.
95
So we're guaranteeing you that income and we're keeping the balance.
96
But we switched the whole model on its head where we're not only an asset manager as a third-party business, asset light, capital light, but we are also a principal.
97
And we're creating an alignment that I think in all times, people will know whether or not they believe we're doing a good job making good investments, they'll know we're aligned.
98
We're aligned with effectively a very large first-loss position in our retirement service business through a theme.
99
We're the biggest investor in a vast majority of our products.
100
That's one big technology shift in terms of how you think about asset management.
101
We're building effectively a more merchant-focused, principal-focused, not agent-focused asset manager.
102
And we think that model is going to win.
103
People who question the model, I think that's one of the big bets we're making.
104
The second thing is just how does all of this long-we're about to go through this generational shift in power, infra, defense, spend.
105
In Europe, it's been completely underspent and is needed.
106
Globally, everybody needs more compute.
107
I don't think there's a debate on that.
108
The question is: how should it be funded?
109
Should it be funded through more traditional sources, which is bond, listed bond equity, or should that be with matched, longer-duration capital?
110
So, the beautiful thing about annuities is it's long-duration liabilities.
111
Beautiful thing about retirement, long duration in terms of the life, 10, 20, 30, 50 years in some cases.
112
That matches really well with long-duration infrastructure projects.
113
So, the natural shift is to go from a more bank-funded, shorter-duration product that is how things were historically funded, whether it's a QSIP bond or an on-balance sheet bank loan in Europe, to a more duration-matched, more retirement insurance-related product, and using that capital in a way.
114
And that's what's happening.
115
You see what's happened with us with Intel, with MBEV, very large transactions that no one in the world ever thought Apollo would be leading.
116
And so, we're in the middle of this.
117
The traditional relationship between investor, asset manager, bank asset manager, SP 500 issuer, and private alternative firm that is deemed to be more of a private equity investor, really stepping in and being a more private credit safe lender.
118
So it's been really fun.
119
I want to come back to Athene and tell that story in detail because that's like a huge innovation and change in how a firm like yours is structured.
120
But I want to also ask first about your perspective on the U.S.'s, the America's role in global capital markets, maybe like in your whole career, and how you see that might change perspectively with what seems like more of a schism in capital markets, in geopolitics, in all these sort of big things.
121
Yeah, look, right now, it's obviously a big focus.
122
I think all of the discussion is around tariffs.
123
I worry much less around tariffs than the public narrative.
124
And I'm hyper-focused on just our position in an effectively monopolistic position in capital markets.
125
We've been the beneficiary of so many things by having the biggest equity market, the place everybody goes to go public, the best venture capital market.
126
If you want to do a growth company, you're coming to the valley.
127
You're coming to the U.S.
128
to get a term sheet.
129
I went and met with a company that actually does pre-seed rounds last week.
130
And they said, we have all these Europeans that are founders, great founders, really smart founders.
131
They send out a business plan in Europe.
132
They get a term sheet back in two weeks.
133
And they send a term sheet out in San Francisco.
134
They get five the next day.
135
And that's the amazing thing about our entire capital system.
136
We are super entrepreneurial, very hungry.
137
And all of that's a function of several hundred billion dollars a year.
138
Every dollar that left the country in any form was coming back because this is the place to invest your capital., everybody is over-indexed generally in their strategic asset allocation to the U.S.
139
It's an amazing thing.
140
It creates a growth vector that's higher than any other global company or European, Asia-based.
141
Our growth vector is just higher because we have a lower cost of capital, we get better talent, we get better companies to go public, we have a $50 trillion debt market.
142
Just amazing tailwinds.
143
That flywheel, we don't want to take a precious asset.
144
We don't want to take that for granted.
145
And why does that happen?
146
Rule of law, really easy to come do business here, understanding of the rules, and a very clear talent density.
147
Yeah, talent density, but also just very clear rules of the road on how things operate.
148
And the thing that worries me a little bit, and there's no place really to put money now.
149
There's no real capital market big enough.
150
But with all the uncertainty going on, you do see new changes in Europe, potentially changes in securitization rules.
151
We have a $15 trillion securitized market here in the U.S.
152
There's a 500 billion securitized market in Europe.
153
The economies aren't that different in size.
154
We're 30 trillion here.
155
We're 24 trillion in Europe.
156
Multi-trillion dollar opportunity to take assets out of the banks into private credit and create tons of liquidity to fund all these growth projects with Germany and France and the rest of the Eurozone need to do because they've underspent on lots of infrastructure and defense.
157
We're creating an incentive and all the global pools want another option other than the U.S.
158
now.
159
And so we just have to be sensitive to that.
160
We trade it because of all the benefits of us growing faster and having better companies, bigger talent pool, that resulted in.
161
That is what really benefits our entire system.
162
And I'm hopeful that we make sure we keep that intact because we've really benefited over the last 20 years.
163
One of the beautiful components of the U.S.
164
system is also innovation in types of financing.
165
And I'd love your perspective on like the key hash marks on a historical timeline for these key innovations, going back 50 years or something like this, maybe junk bonds in the 80s is like the first notable thing.
166
Yeah, we can start there.
167
I think about more distribution function, ETF market, how do people package and consume products, innovation in products?
168
Where's there been product innovation where there hasn't been product innovation?
169
You look at the ETF market, started in 1993.
170
We got to a trillion-dollar ETF market, probably 09, and then we're north of 10 trillion today, sector-focused, every access point, tax advantaged, you name it.
171
Every delivery function through ETF has gotten pretty innovative.
172
You look at the fixed income market.
173
I don't think the daily liquid fixed income products have changed once in 25 years, which is pretty stark.
174
And I think for us, a pretty cool opportunity, right?
175
I think we look at our business and we always joke the fixed income group is the brown suits and bologna sandwiches.
176
This just literally has not changed at all.
177
That's my internal, I created like a brown suits and baloney sandwich picture on AI.
178
And that's like our joke for like, we're not going to be this.
179
And you look at what we've done in our credit business.
180
When I joined Apollo, I was joining Apollo to join Apollo for what Apollo's brand is as the known as just the place when things are dislocated.
181
We have some of the smartest investors and we're going to figure out a way to win and just tenacious in terms of underwriting, work ethic, all the great things that if you're competitive, you want to go work in a place that's going to be work really hard and typically be on the right side of things.
182
When I joined Apollo, that was what I was stepping into.
183
And really, I was pretty intimidated about that.
184
And over time, what's been unique is we've taken a lot of people that are wired that way, that are super competitive, super smart, know the entire capital structure from a loan to a bond to a PREP to an equity, which there's not many people in the market.
185
Typically, people are very narrow.
186
They don't look at the whole capital structure.
187
And we've taken those people who typically worked in opportunistic, high-octane, high-returning vehicles, and we've taken a lot of the most creative people and put them on investment grade.
188
Which you think about innovation is how do you take a deal for like an Intel, $11 billion deal for Intel and structure it in a way that's north of 30 years, really equity-type capital, but where we feel like it's more debt-side protected.
189
You have to have some creativity to do that because it's not something you go to a bank or you go and you just get it off the shelf.
190
It's highly structured, highly creative, working with the company to actually execute on that.
191
And because we put all of our people, we put our best people on that stuff and we have full open architecture.
192
What does that mean?
193
So, what is the directive to those people?
194
Is the directive do the best risk return?
195
Most firms are set up by fund.
196
They're set up by, okay, go buy, go find a company or a preferred or a debt instrument that's going to make 15% rates of return.
197
And we're set up, let's assess the company, let's assess the best solution for that company.
198
And we have pools of capital from 5% to 20%.
199
It could be a buyout.
200
It could be an investment-grade solution, regular way bond deal.
201
But just understanding.
202
They're not incentivized by a single fund.
203
They're incentivized.
204
For us to originate $250 billion a year, you have to have a culture of wanting the issuer to do business with you again.
205
And so we have lots of repeat issuers that say, oh, we may give them an investment-grade bond today, but in two years, it may be in a different situation.
206
They may need a prep rescue or something, or we're in COVID and it's a totally different environment.
207
But because we were in the capital structure, we did something appropriate before, they're more likely to work with us later.
208
This point is, I don't think, as understood that this narrowness by fund, narrowness by business.
209
We have no walls.
210
So our private equity team.
211
There's a pool of capital.
212
There are funds that are different below.
213
But the investment teams, we have discussions across.
214
I'll talk to our private equity team, to our credit team.
215
We can all talk to each other around, okay, maybe we should do this and maybe we should do that.
216
Maybe the company, maybe it would be better to structure it this way for this pool of capital because that's what makes sense for the issuer as opposed to the investment.
217
So there's no hammer looking for a nail.
218
Yeah.
219
Having that and the flexibility to have all parts of that capital changed our business dramatically.
220
Change our business dramatically.
221
That's why you're sure.
222
Maybe if you think about the history since you joined in 2012, maybe now it's time to talk about a theme.
223
Why is that such a massive innovation and how did it happen?
224
Where did that come from?
225
Whose idea was it?
226
How did it get executed?
227
Why haven't others done it to the same degree?
228
We were pretty early.
229
Mark and really brought on Jim Bilardi in really in the middle of the financial crisis.
230
And the idea at that point was that you had very widespreads for investment-grade credit because we were coming out of the financial crisis and you had access to very long-duration.
231
And the asset management side of those businesses and traditional asset management for insurance had not been as sophisticated of going into other things like structure products or just other products other than the traditional QSIP liquid business.
232
And so the core of the business is to originate excess spread, similar rating, and fund the business with super long-duration liabilities.
233
And that there was no one really running it as a growth business.
234
They were running it because a lot of the public stocks traded at a discount to book.
235
So if you look at how much equity capital has been raised in the last, since the GFC, we're over 50% of total equity capital raised in retirement insurance businesses.
236
And we've been the biggest beneficiary of that because we've been very active in growing both our asset side and our liability side.
237
When we started to realize that the business was going to scale, we had to do two things.
238
We knew that we were going to be short origination because how are we going to service our own balance sheet?
239
So from 2014 to 2022, we spent just under $10 billion of our own capital buying our own origination, PK Air, Aviation Finance.
240
We built our own non-qualified mortgage business called NuFi.
241
We bought the CS warehouse business called Atlas.
242
We built and hired in those businesses 4,000 employees that originate assets on behalf of our balance sheet with companies that you don't know are Apollo, but they're Apollo capital.
243
And with that, we never really were building that on behalf of our third-party credit business because most of that's investment-grade, tight spread, collateral.
244
No one would have built a business.
245
Rates were zero.
246
From the financial crisis until 22, the clear trade for anybody who was managing money was.
247
Finance at the cheapest level possible, term finance.
248
So, what do you do?
249
Go into infrastructure, go into real estate, finance it very aggressively, build other alternative products, but don't build a credit business.
250
Why are you going to build a credit business?
251
You can't make no money.
252
You're making no money.
253
And I joke because I feel like it's not a great analogy, but rates went up 500 basis points, and I felt like Lieutenant Dan on the ship.
254
You know, you're like on the ship.
255
Let's go.
256
It was all in all of a sudden because we were now over-indexed to origination.
257
We never had really built out third-party institutional business on that side.
258
We had done it all for our own balance sheet.
259
And we crossed the Rubicon where all of a sudden we're actually originating more than can actually service our own balance sheet.
260
And that's been the last three years.
261
So now, all of a sudden, we can build fixed-increases that are innovative that actually invest side by side with our own retirement business.
262
And now you see everybody trying to get in the business.
263
It's very hard to MA your way into the business because there's a origination culture that's been built here for 15, 20 years just in credit.
264
And to align yourself in a principle way and to actually origination isn't just having a bunch of sorcerers finding risk.
265
Origination is also the understanding what fits our balance sheet and how we think about risk and reward.
266
Very hard to scale if you haven't worked with those people and really have a clear understanding and clear narrative about what works and what doesn't work.
267
A lot of people can originate lots of bad risk.
268
If you wanted to go buy a bunch of stuff, you theoretically could.
269
Probably not a good long-term strategy.
270
We've really built it organically with very little MA in the last several years.
271
So I don't know, now we have tons of our own origination.
272
And Net, we feel like that business is going to do well for a really long period of time.
273
Can you just lay out what Apollo looks like today?
274
So if you just think about the $800 billion, where is that $800 billion allocated in terms of what types of investments and also through what kinds of vehicles?
275
I just think it's like an interesting.
276
Yeah.
277
So the surprising thing, people like half of our 65% of our balance sheets are investment grade.
278
Now, when you look at the business in credit, take credit as a just under $700 billion.
279
You have slightly over $300 billion, our own balance sheet.
280
The other balance is third-party investors investing in our products.
281
Almost all of the investors investing in our products are in sub-investment grade, high-returning credit strategies, direct lending, asset-backed, and high-returning credit strategies.
282
We're going into the more fixed income replacement investment grade solution, business in third-party.
283
We've never really raised any money there.
284
The other half is just our own balance sheet, which is 95% investment grade, 5% alternative, where we're making a spread.
285
Our equity business is predominantly our private equity business, but we have secondaries.
286
We have a climate business.
287
We have a hybrid business, which does everything outside of performing credit.
288
Those businesses have done well for a long period of time.
289
Our private equity business has had top returns for over 35 years.
290
And our hybrid business is effectively the space between performing credit and private equity, everything in between.
291
And that's been a really fast-growing segment for us at just over $80 billion.
292
Can you talk about fees and the business model of asset management, which, as you said in the beginning, historically it's been, you give me some money, I charge you some fees, I charge you a percent of the profits, maybe above a hurdle or something.
293
These are so interesting because, in some cases, these are extremely high-margin businesses, especially like the 2 and 20-driven ones.
294
What do you think about that model?
295
It's persisted for a long time.
296
Do we need innovation there?
297
Where do you think it goes?
298
Yeah, I think it depends on asset category.
299
I think it's really specific on asset category and the ability for you to show outsize returns.
300
If you show outsized returns, you can charge it if you want.
301
Yeah, and people will do it.
302
You look at some of the multi-managers, I mean, they're charging pretty high fee.
303
They can charge it because they've had great high-net returns with Low Vol.
304
And if you can do that over long periods of time with large costs of capital, people will pay fee because they feel like it's differentiated.
305
As you get into products or other things that get more commoditized, and you've seen that happen in parts of the really investment-grade, take investment-grade liquid credit, fees go down a lot.
306
We're really around the more privately originated IG that you can't get elsewhere.
307
And the reason that we've created this platform business is to control all that collateral where no one else can really get it other than unless you own those origination machines.
308
So we feel like because we have those 4,000 people just originating assets that are completely diversifiers to the rest of anyone's credit portfolio, we should get compensated in some form.
309
Where the fee settles out, it'll be somewhat dependent on overall rates and everything else.
310
When rates were zero, it felt like fees were going to collapse.
311
When rates go higher as a percentage of your aggregate return, if you're making 10%, you can charge fee.
312
When credit was making 4%, fees collapsed because the net excess relative to the total return ended up being a lot.
313
In alternative products, you've got to deliver the artistry.
314
If you don't, if the client doesn't feel like they're getting something opportunistic or special, and they don't feel like they're getting either, there's been tremendous push on Co-Invest, which effectively has been a fee reducer, fee reducer, not from headline fee, but effectively a mechanism to fee reduce.
315
You need to partner with clients now in a completely different way than 10, 15 years ago.
316
They've fully built out their own, many of them have built out their own fully capable, very productive, very smart teams that are willing and want to co-underwrite risk with you.
317
And so it's much more of a partnership approach than it ever has been.
318
I'd say I joke because there's always headline in the banks are getting upset with the alternative managers.
319
They're stealing deals from each other.
320
On one hand, we've built out our own origination, but we're still partners with them in so many ways that it's still working.
321
The same thing's happening with the LPGP relationship.
322
They've built out their investment capacity, and so we've had to pivot our business as well.
323
So the whole chain is pivoting their business to be more partner-like and figure out the appropriate Venn diagram on how we work together.
324
I don't know why this is happening, but I laugh that you go meet with venture guys and they all want to get into private equity.
325
Talk to the private equity guys, they all want to get in hybrid.
326
Talk to the hybrid guys, they all want to get in credit.
327
Talk to the credit guys, they all want to get an investment grade.
328
And I'm like, wait, what's going on?
329
I can't actually figure out.
330
I don't know what's happening.
331
I think because markets have been up for so long that these businesses, who's very narrow in whatever they're doing, they're trying to go into bigger asset categories with less binary outcomes and just broader TAMs.
332
And I'm like, but I didn't put it all together until I was like, I don't know what the theme is of that other than like everyone's trying to go bigger market and broader market.
333
I'm really curious to understand how you think three different groups think about Apollo today and then how you would like them to think about Apollo, say five years from now.
334
So the groups.
335
It's not just retail institutions use it too, but people that want to put money in and earn a rate of return on the money, and then shareholders of Apollo, the business.
336
So, maybe starting with issuers.
337
How do we make some progress?
338
I think we did a deal for InBEV in 2020, and I think I got 10 calls, people telling, John, great, it's COVID.
339
You'll never do a deal for an SP 500 company again.
340
Set the stage for that.
341
Why was that?
342
Why does that represent such a change from what the history was prior?
343
Investment-grade companies really never accessed private credit in that way.
344
If you were an investment-grade company, you accessed capital through the bank channel.
345
It was a very narrow view of the world.
346
I need to build a plant, or I'm going to go to a bank, I'm going to raise bonds, or I'm going to raise equity.
347
It was very simple.
348
Like asset allocation was like, okay, I'm going to do 60-40 bond and equity.
349
No privates was involved.
350
And still to this day, 401ks don't buy privates, which we can have a idea that we would be able to do a multi-billion dollar deal for an SP 500 company through private credit and through that was investment-grade rated was something very foreign to the market, very new.
351
And you look now, we've done deals for BP, Air France, Venovia, Intel.
352
The pipeline there is very large because people are realizing that they can get, first off, if you have $100 billion of debt, you're an investment-grade company, doing a $5 billion deal with Apollo is just a diversifier.
353
It doesn't mean it's not a negative conotone anymore.
354
So that's gone away.
355
And two, there's more flexibility we can do with our funding.
356
We can give more flexibility.
357
We can go much longer duration.
358
We can do it attached to a certain asset or some sort of structured.
359
It does not by any means means that the traditional funding sources are going away or that it'll completely change and that it'll all go private, but it's another option.
360
It's here to stay.
361
If you take one of those examples, Intel or BP or whatever, they have options for how they're doing their financing.
362
They chose you.
363
These are big deals.
364
What are the features of the financing from Apollo that are attractive to them relative to the traditional way of doing things?
365
What are the variables that matter to them typically?
366
It's typically off-balance sheet.
367
It doesn't go against their existing debt quantum.
368
So it's typically off-balance sheet, typically longer duration, typically flexibility in some sort of coupon.
369
And when it ramps, if it's a project that's ramping, we may give them a couple years at the onset that you probably couldn't get through a traditional debt market.
370
So really working with the issuer and saying, okay, what are we trying to solve for?
371
Customization.
372
It's all customization.
373
And so we'll work with an issuer six months, nine months, 12 months to work through exactly the customization.
374
And we have the teams that are capable of doing that, which is just very different than the traditional syndicated market.
375
So the perspective from companies today five years forward would be you've evolved as this like personalized lender.
376
Yeah, I hope that's the case.
377
Look, it's gotten a lot better.
378
The more big branded companies we do and the more they'll do it.
379
And the more repeat issuers that we do, the more that it will happen.
380
And we've made a ton of progress in the last five years.
381
But I'll go to certain areas or certain parts of the globe and they're like, aren't you just an equity investor?
382
Aren't you a distress?
383
That still happens every once in a while.
384
Is that our problem?
385
It's just by and large, listen, we have an incredible history of generating fantastic returns, sometimes in more difficult situations and sometimes stepping into situations that no one else would step into.
386
And so people still have that perception of us, despite the business being in a completely different place.
387
Can you comment on just the state of expected rates of return across asset classes today?
388
You mentioned the zero rates for so long.
389
The expected return was nothing, and so people weren't interested in it.
390
Equities have come off a period of extremely strong returns since 2009.
391
We now have this group of people that have had real long careers that didn't experience that drawdown and have seen nothing but like awesome returns to the SP 500.
392
What's your assessment of the landscape today?
393
Just looking perspectively, there's all these people.
394
I don't want to talk about the innovation, 401k, annuities, retirement, et cetera, in a minute.
395
But there's all these people, all these pools of capital that want a rate of return.
396
They're interested in credit again because there's a yield.
397
What's your sort of like state of the union on what returns could or might be, how you're thinking about it for the next 10 or 20 years?
398
So we created a whole alternative universe based on zero rates.
399
Most of the product design was based on zero rates.
400
And it is still yet up for debate on how much of your return during that 15-year period was from just really low subsidized interest rates or actually from operational excellence.
401
And we'll see that over the next couple of years as we start to try to monetize some of these assets.
402
But buying an unlevered asset at 5% or 6%, which is infra-real estate-related activity, and funding at zero, as I mentioned, makes a ton of sense.
403
It works.
404
Funding at six or seven and buying an asset at five, six, or seven, that's good.
405
That's good.
406
So I think it's going to be harder.
407
I think it's going to be harder.
408
You're taking more risk.
409
It's a different risk profile.
410
I think those assets should be matched more with IG long-duration product, not levered product, because the leverage is too expensive.
411
There'll be other times where the leverage is cheap, but right now it doesn't make all that much sense.
412
But we've raised all these pools of capital under a construct that all of these alternative products should make 15% plus rates of return in all different environments.
413
Private assets generally, private equity generally has made net returns 13 plus across the board.
414
You've seen packaging and secondaries grow, access points are going to grow.
415
I think that's a pretty good place to be in just generally private assets.
416
I'd say broadly speaking, we have a high-level view that all assets are going to get more liquid over time.
417
And so the question is, what's that going to do to returns?
418
And what's that going to do to volatility of those returns and the perceived riskiness of those assets?
419
Can you say a lot more about that?
420
I think that is like such an interesting topic.
421
It also seems to be like the topic of the moment with some of the stuff going on with endowments.
422
There's an incredible amount of money in private credit and private equity, and lots of it has been illiquid for a really long time.
423
And off-ramp and liquidity are really interesting questions.
424
What do you think is going to happen?
425
This is back to the market structure conversation, which is you've historically had a market structure where institutions and actually probably 20 or 30 institutions controlled or dominated the private markets and defined private markets as private equity in all asset categories, private equity and infra real estate and true corporate.
426
And now you have the evolution of the wealth business and 91% of private wealth clients don't have an alt.
427
And that's growing at very fast rate where people are trying to get access to private assets because most companies have gone private and don't go public.
428
And so to get access to the whole economy, you probably need to own private assets.
429
The structure of those vehicles in evergreen form versus the traditional drawdown form where you call capital, you're going to have lower headline returns, IRR versus actually evergreen returns.
430
Now, I think I told you about this, which is, I did this comic where you have the two people at their 10-year reunion, and one person says, I've saved 100 grand.
431
And the other girl, Susie, says, I saved 100 grand.
432
Let's make sure we invest it well.
433
And then they showed the 20-year reunion and come back, and he's got this nice suit on, and he says, I've absolutely killed it.
434
I invested in all these private and I made 32%.
435
Next frame, she has this like really sad face.
436
And she's like, I invested in all these evergreen strategies and made 13.
437
And she's like, just curious, like, how much do you have?
438
And he says, I have 180 grand.
439
She goes, I have 330.
440
I don't understand.
441
I explained that story to my friends, my in-laws, people who aren't in the business.
442
It's still not understandable.
443
It's not understandable to them that somebody could say they made 32% a year and someone made 12, and somehow one of them has more money than the other because of the compounding elements of it.
444
And I know that you get it, but as you go down the distribution channel of more evergreen products, you're going to see a much more normal risk reward where equity is making somewhere between high single digits and low double digits.
445
And then credit, depending on where we are in the rate cycle, will make high single digit, low double digit, whether it's levered or unlevered.
446
But the compounding element and the income orientation in a more high-rate regime is more valuable.
447
International assets have traded historically at lower growth and lower multiple.
448
And if some of this foreign direct investment changes, could you see with Germany really powering the printing press for the first time in a decade?
449
Could you see a normalization of multiple and a bit more higher growth regime in Europe?
450
Everyone has a hard time betting on that, but it feels like the stars are aligned that potentially you see a higher growth regime in Europe for the first time in a decade.
451
So how do you think we get pricing, liquidity, interesting new ways for people that have put all this money into these vehicles and want to get it out?
452
I think that there's going to be secondaries marketplaces.
453
I think the secondary business is going to change dramatically.
454
I think private asset exchanges will happen.
455
We've obviously started.
456
You're going to do it.
457
Who will build those?
458
I think there's going to be new.
459
First off, I think there's going to be a need.
460
Two, I think that the more that wealth wants equity product and private equity type products, the more that they're going to need a liquidity lever and a need for this private marketplace.
461
And so, how that's designed is a question.
462
You see us experimenting.
463
And one of the things I love about our place is we experiment with a lot of different things, and we're experimenting with market making on private IG.
464
We've experimented with doing partnership with State Street and Lord Abbott.
465
We're experimenting with what we listed our first fund on blockchain with five different protocols, and we're tokenizing the fund where I think funds will actually trade.
466
And even though they're quarterly liquid, they'll trade every day.
467
365, 24-7.
468
Coinbase saying that they're going to list a token that's backed by their stock.
469
You can see what's happening, which is this evolution to this 365, 24-7.
470
It's such a strange thing to imagine, I don't know, an LP interest in a normal private equity fund trading when the amount of information available on the fund, let alone the underlying companies and holdings and all that detail.
471
It trades in secondary pretty liquidly.
472
There's a pretty big bit.
473
You look at the volumes going through the secondary business every year.
474
It's extremely liquid.
475
If you want to get out of it in most market conditions, you can get out of it at some price not that far from 90, 92, 96, depending on the fund, depending on the design of the fund, the second.
476
The more you pool assets, the more likely you'll get more liquidity, to your point.
477
So, the more that you can call it diversified beta, the more likely you'll be able to.
478
More that it's deemed to be private markets beta as opposed to single-name underwrite, the more likely you can actually move the risk.
479
And that's happened in the fixed-income market where portfolio trading is happening.
480
You can trade a pool of investment-grade bonds at three basis points, but if you want to trade a single-name bond, it's half a point to a point-wide, which is just vastly different in terms of cost of execution.
481
What do you think happens in the wealth market?
482
Like, that seems to have become a huge driver of new capital coming into industry.
483
It's hard to say it doesn't grow.
484
People are just under-indexed to private.
485
It's not that dissimilar to the story I said about 2003, a billion dollars was a really big credit fund.
486
And by the way, I was 24 years old going to Geneva.
487
I'd go there, they'd send me, I'm like, they should not be marketing this product.
488
I'm like not prepared to do this.
489
I'd go over there, I'd read off my list, I'd prep myself for what the marketing pitch was for a long short credit fund.
490
And we would raise 50 to 75 million dollars on one meeting.
491
Now, I'm at Apollo with close to 25 years of experience.
492
It takes us two or three years to raise a dollar sometimes.
493
People want to know, I'm right, on repeat, the gestation period to raise money.
494
It's completely gotten out of it, it's so much longer than it ever was.
495
In wealth, it's the early days where they need product, they need to get more indexed, they want to go with big, high-quality managers, they want to go with someone they know they trust, et cetera.
496
But there's only a handful of brands that can do that, and they're all short product.
497
So, the tailwinds there are going to be hard to see them not continue to grow.
498
For any shareholders listening, I hope they love us.
499
We are extremely, generally at our core, we are pretty unsatisfied generally.
500
We try lots of different things.
501
We have probably one of the smartest, most strategic leaders in the marketplace.
502
And that really powers the culture of the place.
503
We have a set of people who are really, it's pretty flat still.
504
You'll have principals and associates and analysts are not afraid to talk to me or anybody else.
505
And we like it that way.
506
If you have a good idea, bring it up.
507
We don't really have all the hierarchical stuff of a traditional, what you think of as an $800 billion manager.
508
To me, it still feels pretty flat.
509
And we want to keep that feeling.
510
There's the played football at Amherst, and there was this game that we lost my senior year against Wesleyan.
511
We lost 24-17.
512
We were definitely not supposed to lose.
513
Anyone on Wesleyan, you weren't supposed to win.
514
It was like Sunday, the day after the game.
515
We were all sitting there.
516
And the coach came out.
517
He was like, thumb guys, finger guys.
518
Don't blame anyone else.
519
Don't be a finger guy.
520
We're all thumb guys.
521
And the point was: take the accountability yourself.
522
Stop trying to blame everything else.
523
And when things go wrong or we're trying to create something, people take it on themselves.
524
And we have that just embedded culture of just owning that ownership of both successes and mistakes.
525
But really on the mistake side, people aren't always looking to blame other people.
526
And we've surrounded ourselves with those people.
527
We do that with our people, but that just emanates the whole place.
528
Such a cool, amazing concept.
529
If everyone did that, I think a lot of companies would be a lot better.
530
I have sort of like a two-part question.
531
In addition to the fingers versus thumbs thing, I'm curious how you think about the culture first as a participant in it.
532
And the second part of the question is, how you navigated what has been, you're fairly young, like a fairly meteoric rise inside of Apollo from managing 130 million to the position that you're in now.
533
Thinking back on that, why do you think that happened?
534
What did you do to do that?
535
Everyone part of it, you always have to bifurcate seat versus person.
536
Part of it, I was like, Mark drove a theme.
537
Credit became powered by an internal pool of capital.
538
Our teams did an incredible job of navigating, creating new asset classes, being innovative.
539
But listen, when you have tailwinds like that and you're one of the leaders of those businesses and help architect that business, that obviously helps.
540
But we have an incredible team, incredible people, but also the leadership across the board.
541
They've always let, if we have an idea, they've let us run with it.
542
You know, in 2018, 19, we did a billionaire deal, direct lending deal, and no one was doing multi-billion dollar deals.
543
And we did it with not a very big direct business.
544
When we wanted to go to the Middle East and partner with Mubadola to raise a $12 billion balance sheet, no one had raised a large cap direct lending.
545
This is 2019.
546
No one had thought of really raising a balance sheet to commit to distribute and hold and have our own balance sheet that were effectively 50-50 with Muvadola.
547
No one thought about those things.
548
Creating asset-backed businesses, our platform business, all of these things into products.
549
If it was a good idea, pure meritocracy and pure just engagement with the entrepreneurial spirit, despite us getting bigger, we haven't lost that.
550
And that starts with Mark and goes down to Zelter and Kleinman and just an acceptance across the board.
551
And the team has just been amazing.
552
And so that part has been fun.
553
I'm.
554
So I have to work on that because even when things aren't supposed to change, I like the change.
555
But the industry has changed a lot.
556
I have tried to be really market-oriented around what is the appropriate equilibrium of where the market should sit, both in product design, fee, and asset category, and really question how to disrupt ourselves.
557
I'm okay with that discussion.
558
There's many people who are not okay with that discussion.
559
I love that discussion because I'm like, okay, well, then let's do it.
560
I want to go, someone's going to disrupt it.
561
I'd rather just do it ourselves before letting anything else happen.
562
And I think you build trust by having that mentality.
563
The other thing is, I oversee a really big private credit business.
564
That's how it's viewed from the outside.
565
And really now I oversee a big private markets business.
566
But I grew up in a public markets DNA in a job that was literally: here's a draw of very small nominal dollars.
567
Eat what you kill.
568
If you lose money, you won't have a job.
569
And that's like a different thing.
570
It's a different thing.
571
You have to be all over all of the risk all of the time.
572
That's hard to untrain.
573
Part of that training, though, was create with very little capital.
574
I worked at a $500 billion, $3 billion fund.
575
What you had to do in that is you had to design the skill of having the idea, going and creating the idea, getting other people to believe it's another good idea, having the banks in some cases finance that idea.
576
And so I was constantly training ourselves and our team with small pools of capital with no brand.
577
We were small brands, Braincourt, these places were small, not in Apollo, where I learned how to do things without that business card, that seat.
578
I learned to do it with very little resources.
579
And so now when you have the resources, all of a sudden you're just like incredibly empowered to do things and you can do the whole deal yourself.
580
Having that public spark of DNA in the context of a big privates manager, that really differentiates ourselves from a lot of different people out there.
581
I also love this idea you've talked to me about before, that historically Apollo and firms like it are attacking the alternatives sleeve of someone's portfolio, maybe the 20% allocation they have to alternatives, and that the future might be much more about attacking all 100% of a portfolio.
582
How do you think about that shift, making that happen, making that possible?
583
It's a very different approach.
584
First, you have to agree that privates and publics become one.
585
Overwhelming thesis that most assets get more liquid over time.
586
So let's just assume that assets get more liquid over time.
587
So what was seemingly perceived to be less liquid before will be more liquid and more accessible and more acceptable into those portfolios.
588
There are certain states today which will take a rated private asset and a rated IG private asset, and it eats against their private equity bucket because it's deemed private.
589
So by definition, we are all wired, and we've talked about this a lot.
590
We were wired to think that private is risky.
591
But if it's an Intel bond with a 20-year guarantee from Intel, is it riskier or safer than the Intel QSIP bond?
592
And you're attached to the asset.
593
So you actually have a double claim in some ways.
594
So that part we think will over time go away, particularly for start with private IG.
595
Let's just start with credit to start, which is you have a third party saying that this is rated X.
596
SP is saying this is rated triple B.
597
S P is saying this other asset's rated triple B.
598
So you have guideposts.
599
If you have the guideposts, when you look at your credit allocation in a 60-40, shouldn't you just be optimizing for return with your credit allocation?
600
And will that go into equity pools, both private and public?
601
Should there be diversifiers to the SP 500?
602
These are, I think, real questions.
603
If you look at market structure, if you look at how capital pools are growing, they're telling you that's what's happening.
604
When we talk to a client in the future, I don't think we're going to be talking about the 20.
605
We're going to be talking about, okay, what's the best risk-reward?
606
And by the way, we're organizing our business with no walls.
607
So the earlier comment on risk-reward, it's the same thing when you talk to an issuer.
608
What are you solving for?
609
Here are all the things you can do in credit, public, private.
610
We do all those things.
611
By the way, we do them on our own balance sheet.
612
Let's compare notes.
613
Okay, equity.
614
What are you looking for?
615
Public, private?
616
Okay, we do all those things.
617
We understand exactly that.
618
Okay, here's the solutions we can provide you.
619
And by the way, let's put it all together.
620
There's a whole other ecosystem around private assets and data and exactly who owns what information you get from your data set versus public markets data sets, and which I think, again, early days, but I think the broader, bigger, scalable businesses that have more touch points across the economy, particularly when the economy is going more private than public, hopefully we can use that data to make better investment decisions.
621
If I'm an equity investor, I'm a private equity investor or a longshore hedge fund investor or a pot investor or something.
622
What is the value to me to understand what's the most important parts of your world to do my job better?
623
For someone who grows up on the capital structure side, where you have to understand all parts of the capital structure, but as a credit investor, you need to understand the structural dynamics and flexibility of loans and converts and bonds and PREFs.
624
When you're purely equity investor, typically when you talk to them, they're focused predominantly on one thing, which is top line growth.
625
And if you get the three-year top line, no one wants to talk about debt.
626
But now you have venture companies actually building defense companies that are going to be super asset heavy.
627
And now you have hyperscalers that have never had any debt that need a lot, that are becoming now more capital-intensive.
628
So the powering of this stuff is more capital-intensive, but investing in businesses and optimizing for ROE, you can, if you're running a business and you understand all the different flexibility points at different parts of the capital structure on balance sheet and off balance sheet, you're going to optimize and have better shareholder returns over time because you're going to give yourself a lot more flexibility.
629
And in some cases, have much cheaper growth capital than you think you probably do than just raising equity.
630
If you understand credit and you're an equity investor, typically you understand all the option value.
631
You are long when you issue debt and you just create lots of optionality for yourself that maybe if you didn't understand that, you wouldn't price it into your stock.
632
If you were teaching like a HBS class or something on the class was called How to Build a Great Origination Platform.
633
You work with a lot of origination platforms.
634
You've bought a lot of them historically.
635
It's like a really key feature of everything that you do.
636
You have to originate these things.
637
What would be the curriculum or the syllabus of that class?
638
Number one, have very clear credit box, very clear rules of the road on what you buy and what you don't buy.
639
When you're not clear on that, it can create lots of issues.
640
And so the more clear you can be up front, if you're clear with someone about what you're willing to buy and what you're not willing to buy, what are the parameters and bookends of what you're willing to buy and not buy, that empowers your origination machine.
641
If you're not clear, if you're not clear on your decision making, if there's not a clear point of accountability, it creates way too much noise in the channel.
642
So the number one rule is make sure you spend all the time in the world to define the credit box and be very quick.
643
If you don't want to do stuff, be quick to redefine that credit box and be clear with your communication to anyone who's originating on your behalf.
644
That's the rule number one.
645
It sounds pretty simple, but you'd be surprised how hard it is to execute at scale.
646
Do you have a favorite example of an origin of a great, what you view to be a great origination platform?
647
Just like tell a little story about what one of these things might look like.
648
So CS was going through some changes and then ultimately bought by UBS.
649
Atlas was the structured products business at Credit Suisse.
650
It was the number one profit center for a decade, generating a big percentage of CS's earnings for a long time with effectively no losses.
651
They had a $45 billion balance sheet.
652
And what they do is they provide warehouses to originators all over the world.
653
And they would let those originators write a bunch of small loans.
654
And when they get to a certain quantum, they would securitize those loans and distribute those loans through a distribution mechanism.
655
Because CS stock was trading at such a discount to book, they needed to, if they could sell it at book value, it was actually accretive.
656
But what was, this had every, this was the classic Apollo deal.
657
It had mortgages, it had solar, it had commercial real estate, it had consumer.
658
To underwrite all of those things was almost impossible for anyone in the market other than us because you had to have the full suite of the team and you had to bring on the full OpEx of the business.
659
So you're talking about 300 people.
660
In 22, when rates moved, they sent 2 million wires for margining.
661
Okay.
662
You have to know all these asset classes and you have to have the experience of being able to take on a team culturally, integrate the team, all those things, and then execute on a plan.
663
So it got down to the wire.
664
I remember sitting here, we were sitting here.
665
It was like midnight or 1 a.m.
666
and I was eating Chinese food with one of the analysts and the deal partner.
667
I was like, this is fun.
668
Like, I love this.
669
But we're back.
670
Let's do this again.
671
And that's what it's like.
672
We were all on the floor having fun, and we ended up winning that deal.
673
We ended up taking on 28 billion of assets.
674
We brought in three partners, including Mass Mutual, to partner with us on the equity, two sovereigns as well.
675
And now we're on pace to grow that to, I think, 50 billion.
676
And our long-term goal is to grow that to a $100 billion warehouse business.
677
We've hired 180 people into that business, completely, we'd have to restaff it with its own CFO, CRO, entire operations as a real company.
678
We rebranded it Atlas, and now we control 280 separate warehouses.
679
We're one of the go-to places to provide across all these different asset categories, and we control the front end.
680
That's just right down the middle of the fairway, everything about Apollo, where it's working.
681
What deal that you have been an intimate part of has been the most fun for you out of all?
682
I'd say the most time and attention the last five years I had to deal with was probably Carbona.
683
And I know you know, Ernie, that situation went from us being down half a billion dollars to up a billion dollars, probably in a matter of six months.
684
It went from us being a lead order in a JPMorgan syndicated deal in 22 to all of the bonds a year later trading at 30, having bought another 750.
685
And I think every single investor, every meeting I went into, I was like, I will never do this again.
686
Every single meeting I went into, I was getting questions like, what's going on?
687
And it sounds like it was a big position for us.
688
But in the context of all of our funds, even with it at 30, we had, we were up 8% or 9%.
689
So we took 100 or 150 basis point loss by vehicle.
690
But just because it was in the news, it was so much headline for meme, the whole thing.
691
And, you know, I kind of sensed that there was going to be an issue.
692
I think probably in November of 22, about six months after we did the original deal, every time I started going out to California to go to the Athene offices, I would email Ernie and say, hey, I'm going to be in Phoenix.
693
We need to catch up.
694
And he'd be like, okay.
695
I'm sure you can tell.
696
He was like, who's this guy?
697
First off, who's this guy from Apollo?
698
And what does he want?
699
There's not a problem yet.
700
And then bonds keep going down.
701
I'm texting him.
702
I was looking at my text last night and I was like, wait, how am I going to tell this story?
703
And you look at the text from the beginning and he wouldn't respond.
704
He wouldn't engage.
705
He just wouldn't.
706
And it was like, sure.
707
And you could tell.
708
He's like, who is this person?
709
Yeah.
710
I think in November, we caught wind that they were going to try to do.
711
And by the way, I probably did 20 calls in two or three dinners with him.
712
He heard what I was saying, but he didn't.
713
He was just worried that I was trying to do something that was not in his best interest, which I understood.
714
You can get that.
715
They hire Molis, and I catch wind of it prior to it that they're going to launch a super coercive exchange.
716
And this is before the idea of co-ops.
717
Co-ops are where you actually partner with other creditors and agree that no matter what, we're going to take the same deal so that they can't take other lenders and give them a better deal versus us.
718
They say, listen, guys.
719
So it was a five and a half billion of outstanding debt.
720
Coalescing five and a half billion of debt requires you to have known these people for a long period of time.
721
And the credit markets, whether or not you accept it or not, is a cottage industry.
722
Handful of people, I'm friends with most people in the market.
723
I'd like to say I've not done anything wrong to anyone in the market and generally have real personal relationships that have gone for a long period of time.
724
They're deep, real relationships that, because in credit, it's not zero sum.
725
The equity markets are more zero sum.
726
You win the deal, I lose the deal.
727
You typically are in the same bond with them or seem loan, or maybe we'll be on the other side, but I know I'll be in the same side again.
728
And so it's a very different dynamic.
729
So we were able to get 90% of the bonds on board.
730
They launched this exchange.
731
The exchange gets blocked.
732
What is the exchange describing?
733
The exchange is effectively: hey, if you roll into this bond at a steep discount, we'll give you security, but you have to take a big haircut to par.
734
So all of us said no.
735
They launched it.
736
They extended it and no deal.
737
And people don't know this part of the story, but I'm sitting in vacation, like my first vacation, probably a year in the south of France.
738
And I'm sitting there with my wife.
739
And guess who's sitting next to me?
740
Ken Mullis and his wife.
741
Okay.
742
And I'm like, Ken, I'm on vacation.
743
And it's one of these places where you got to stay like a minimum couple nights or whatever.
744
And so Ken's there sitting at every meal.
745
He's there.
746
And I'm like, Ken, can we somehow get to an agreement on this other thing?
747
And he's like, his famous quote of the whole thing is: co-ops are made to say no, meaning that once you guys all get together, you're never going to get to a deal.
748
I'm like, we can get to a deal, reasonable deal.
749
Just get everyone together, send us over something.
750
I'm just encouraging them then to do it.
751
And finally, you realize that, first off, to get these deal done, incredibly hard, very rare to get done.
752
Two, it's probably the only co-op where everything worked.
753
We cut a deal, the stock, and we had bought stock at four.
754
The stock went from four to over to 280 in the next 12 months.
755
The bonds went from 30, you exchanged at 90, those bonds were trading at 120 a year later.
756
Everybody won in this.
757
There's very rarely do you have, in that time short of time period, do you have a deal that's effectively a fair deal, not where we're taking the equity thing?
758
And a year later, everybody's won.
759
Now, we sold the stock at like 15 and it went to 290.
760
So we're the idiots.
761
Here, I'll pull it up now because I was laughing.
762
Ernie and I are both into where he wouldn't reply to anything before.
763
Now we're like personal friends, and I'm like reading through the text.
764
And I sent him this song.
765
I sent him Evening Gown by Nick Jagger.
766
I don't know why.
767
I sent him this song like a year ago.
768
We're both into music.
769
And he goes, If the FBI had to profile you based on your music, they would say you were a 60-year-old from West Texas with an optimistic form of depression.
770
So you go through the channel and you're like, okay, how did this deal get done?
771
It got done because I was just kept going back.
772
I kept being super brutally honest.
773
And despite his lack of, he didn't want to trust, I think part of it was like institutionally or what we were doing.
774
He just didn't want to.
775
Smart people just see through it.
776
Smart people just see through when they actually were.
777
He heard me for the content.
778
And once he got there, you talk to him now, he'll tell you there was no deal without us having spent all that time before and the whole process of me going to Phoenix all those times and actually engaging with him and just keep giving him just feedback.
779
And in most cases, that situation would have ended up in some sort of bankruptcy or some sort of aggressive thing where no one probably would have won, honestly.
780
That one was fun because I feel like Ernie and I are great friends now.
781
And I think we both learned a lot.
782
And you realize that you have to have flexible capital.
783
You have to be willing to actually commit to having a personal, trusting relationship with whoever the decision maker is.
784
And if you don't have that trusting, personal relationship with the decision maker, not only the decision maker, but also your peers.
785
Because in credit, you have to be able to agree that sometimes one plus one is three.
786
It's not zero sum.
787
And that amazing story, and I love having heard it.
788
It's obviously one of the most fascinating capital market stories of the last 20 years.
789
Another story that I've loved hearing you talk about is Hertz, mostly just because it seems to tell the story of what Apollo does and why it's interesting and differentiated.
790
Can you tell that story as well?
791
Yeah, so that story was like 2016 annual meeting.
792
I said that Hertz would file for bankruptcy.
793
I was dead wrong for three, four years.
794
It was like, because I was of the view that Uber, people would rent fewer cars, pricing would collapse, used car prices would go down.
795
That was kind of thesis in 2016.
796
COVID hits.
797
I talked to the management team a month later.
798
They're like, we don't have any plans for anything.
799
Eva does fine.
800
And I'm like, okay, so this is like locked up in my house in Bedford.
801
I'm like, what are you guys talking about?
802
And we bought several hundred million of June insurance and company filed in May, literally a month later after they told me everything was fine.
803
So that was like the start of the Hertz journey.
804
From there, we bought the term loan at 60.
805
We thought that we'd probably own the company at a sub-billion dollars, very different with our company.
806
When we hated it, it was a $10 billion company.
807
We were buying the company effectively at a distress for control, which is again, not really what we do historically, but it was COVID times.
808
And we were like, hey, if we own it here, we don't think it's going to be distressed for control, but if we own it at this valuation, it's worth this.
809
We refinanced to think about the story of Apollo and how it can actually provide solutions, right?
810
From that point forward, we became the largest secured lender.
811
We provided the DIP.
812
We refinanced $4 billion of that summer, $4 billion of their entire used car vehicle financing because they had to, they, because the used cars were collapsed, they needed a refi.
813
We refied $4 billion.
814
The term loan went up.
815
Then we, when the company ultimately ended up exiting bankruptcy, they took out the term loan.
816
In November of that year, they had a lease business, a platform business that actually did fleet finance inside of Hertz that they wanted to sell before they exited.
817
We bought it in our platform business and have merged it with Wheels, which is a specialty lending fleet finance platform business.
818
Then, when they actually ended up being a solvent company where there was value to the equity, Nighthead ends up winning the bid.
819
We provide the $2.5 billion exit financing, which six months later we get taken out at $130.
820
We put in $10 billion into the ecosystem across DIP, secured, securitized product, pref, buying a business out of the platform.
821
Nobody could have navigated that hole over a 12 or 18-month period.
822
You have to have tons of flexibility, creativity, and agility.
823
You can't, you have to think up and down the capital structure.
824
That was the first time I saw the whole platform at work working together from our platform team to our senior team to our hybrid team, all working in.
825
You need a combination of market ball and single name ball for that to happen.
826
But when it happens and you can execute on it and showcase everything, again, being close to the decision maker, the more we did, the more we were getting the first call, right?
827
By providing the 4 billion of securitized products.
828
It's not that, that's a plus 300 business, meaning it's not high returning.
829
But because we did that, guess what?
830
We got the first call on the platform.
831
Then we did that.
832
We were the call.
833
We got a call last minute on that prep from Nighthead.
834
And in 30 minutes, because we knew the company so well, I said, okay, we'll do $2.5 billion a prep.
835
Because we could react that quickly at scale, big and fast, very few firms can move big and fast like that.
836
And when we move big and fast like that, because we know the businesses so well, we follow them well, we have a big balance sheet to be able to commit fast.
837
And we do it in a way that it's because we have, we've invested in five that we're invested in all these companies for so long.
838
I.O.
839
companies don't, they never go away.
840
They either get acquired, they either refinance their debt, so they're back in market every two or three years, or they file.
841
It's never like you do the loan and hope you're going to get paid enough in cash.
842
So they're, these are companies that you follow for a long period of time.
843
I'd love to talk about some of the future categories that you think you'll be most focused on.
844
The obvious one is like U.S.
845
infrastructure build out around AI.
846
AI is, of course, like, you have to ask about it.
847
It's the thing everyone's talking about.
848
I know you've spent some time meeting with some of the young companies, which is so cool.
849
We've known some of the same companies.
850
It's pretty wild to imagine like where the world's going.
851
But when you think about Apollo's role in all of that, one of the things happening is just a massive outlay of capital to update in compute infrastructure.
852
How do you think about something like that?
853
How do you approach?
854
My wife's banned me from talking about AI at dinner because I think it ruins a dinner party.
855
So we don't talk about it.
856
I was like a doomer about it.
857
I'm less nihilist.
858
I'm more excited about it, but I want to talk about it a lot.
859
I think there's three segments of our business that we have to think about.
860
One is the aggregate data, taking tons of unstructured data and structuring it.
861
How do we use that in a way that's attractive?
862
How do we use that in a way that potentially is predictive?
863
Two is all the operations of a financial services company, which I think will just get better, right?
864
The way that just everything from custody to cash transfer, trade settlement, whenever you do a transaction, there's a whole host of workflow that I think will get more optimized and more efficient.
865
And three is the investment process.
866
And really for us, that's how do you co-pilot?
867
How do you create co-pilots to make our risk decision makers better?
868
I think that's going to happen.
869
You have to have people who are very proficient at that to actually train the computer and the system and create the system the way you want.
870
You can create a system that gives you bad advice too.
871
So you want to make sure that it's creating it under the framework that you acknowledge to be the framework that will suit the product's needs or the funds needs or the investment process needs.
872
That stuff's pretty exciting for us because we're very large, which means we have lots of information and lots of optimized stuff that we can do that we haven't done yet.
873
So I'm pretty excited about our future.
874
In that regard, I'm really excited about doing it.
875
It's obviously, you talk to people in the ecosystem, they get a little nervous about what that means for everybody.
876
I think that we're just going to be doing our jobs better and more proficient and be able to do more, which is, I think, exciting.
877
Do you think it affects where you put your dollars, meaning like so much money is being.
878
Do you think you'll be involved in that part of the equation?
879
Yeah.
880
So compute is the center of all of this, and the demands for compute will go up.
881
The sizing of these mega data centers is astronomical.
882
There's not, frankly, there's only a few investors that can finance them with matched liabilities at the scale, and we're fortunate to be one of them.
883
I think we'll be a leader in that.
884
Intel was just the start of that.
885
There'll be a handful of us which will lead that charge, which again, the most important thing for that is that we work.
886
First off, the counterparty risk typically is high quality because the hyperscalers and others that want that compute are typically very well capitalized and growing their earnings really quickly.
887
So the more that we can partner with them to create the most flexible type of capital structure duration-wise that matches with exactly what they need, I think the more likely we're going to be the service provider of that.
888
And I think we are positioned, given just the org design of the liability structure of our business, we're designed to be the provider, one of the largest providers of all that capital.
889
It feels like that and probably defense are probably our largest sectors that are growing really quickly.
890
If you think about young entrepreneurs interested in capital markets amidst this entire shifting, changing landscape that we spend a lot of time describing, where do you think are the most interesting opportunities to start new finance firms, new capital markets firms, new asset managers?
891
Look, I always think there's going to be some level of the core, let's say core credit, core equity businesses are going to get consolidated.
892
So if you're big, you're going to become mega and you're going to distribute and produce products.
893
And I think there'll be consolidation there and you're seeing that.
894
But there'll always be the family office.
895
Like, no one paid attention to me for at least five years.
896
What the hell is this guy doing over there with his long short credit fund?
897
And I did that for 10 years before coming here.
898
So, those businesses are wake up every day, super risk-managed, or in the liquid business, super risk-managed, and every line item, every risk, every night.
899
And you're living and breathing the artistry of that business, whether it's buying small businesses, investing in small businesses, venture.
900
These are just artist businesses.
901
And I think there's always room for the artist in the aggregate asset allocation.
902
So, my thing is: fine, find something that you love doing, find something you're super interested in, create a product around that, and get yourself excited about what you're doing every day.
903
Because if you do that, you're going to probably design a pretty good product and a pretty good investment process.
904
And the clients, again, the clients see through this stuff.
905
They either feel the authenticity of whether or not you care or not, or whether or not you're interested in that or not, in the product that you design, they know.
906
And whether or not they know day one, they'll know.
907
Do you think there's a future for Apollo in sports, financing teams, doing anything like that?
908
In a world where let's go AI abundance and let's go seven night a week.
909
The Ari, we just backed Ari and his the Miami Open and Madrid Open, and hopefully, the some other events.
910
Their thesis is the events business went from two nights a week to work from home, turned it into three or four nights a week.
911
Then you go AI abundance.
912
It's a seven-night-a-week business.
913
People will be enjoying a GDP that's five to 10X, and we're all just getting serviced by robots.
914
Let's go there.
915
AI abundance.
916
And if we do.
917
What happens in asset categories that go up in value really quickly?
918
Take sports teams, for example, when they go up so fast, but it's not so much cash flow, it's more enterprise.
919
Yeah, there's not a ton of lending.
920
So there's this huge gap in specialty finance.
921
And so I think you could see us lending against teams more actively, not so much buying teams, but I could see us doing more things like we did with Ari, where we provide financing and own a little bit of, and we back them through some sort of hybrid instrument.
922
Yeah, it'd be really cool to imagine you applying this to literally every single sector as it matures over time.
923
Yeah.
924
As you do that, what are the things in the Apollo culture that you hope either stay the same or grow or become more true?
925
Just a willingness to try new things.
926
I think everyone realizes the world's changing pretty quick.
927
And if not, the thing they're going to realize, it's just changing fast.
928
It feels like it's changing faster than any of us can even accept.
929
And the people who are closer to it even say, we can't even predict this stuff.
930
So just a willingness to try new things and openness, a flexibility around that.
931
I prefer Gumby.
932
We want people who are willing to test some of those norms and just be outside-the-box thinkers and not just because something worked in the past necessarily is it going to work in the future.
933
And just have fun doing it.
934
We have our Olympics.
935
I try to keep things pretty fun.
936
We do like an Olympics.
937
We had last year at the end of the Olympics, we had this like kind of standard corporate Olympics.
938
It was going to be fine.
939
It was fun.
940
We go out to Randall's Island.
941
But to mix it up, I always do something a little different.
942
I had the team meet us at the fish market at 5 a.m.
943
We got three 50-pound grease cods because when I was growing up in Maine, we'd have this annual greased cod race where you had to get in a fireman's outfit and a 50-pound grease cod back and forth.
944
Didn't tell anyone what the five finished.
945
And then I pulled out the two, three 50-pound grease cods, and it was the relay race for who would win.
946
But we still are trying to have fun here.
947
I'd like to think that most of us, you got to have fun coming to work and enjoy doing it.
948
Where do you find the meaning in all this stuff?
949
And the reason I ask this question is: my wife and I are watching this new John Hamm show on Apple TV a couple episodes.
950
And I find it to be both really fun to watch and also maximally depressing.
951
It makes me like hurt.
952
And it's all these guys who are incredibly rich whose lives could not seem like emptier or worse.
953
Yeah.
954
And I think this is a true thing that happens in finance where like the product literally is money.
955
And therefore, like the world is money.
956
The incentives are money.
957
And the market system is incredibly powerful.
958
And this is capital markets are the centerpiece of it.
959
We talked about that at the beginning, how powerful an asset this is for the U.S.
960
But it seems like there's a chance that you get really distorted by the incentives and the structure of the system as a human.
961
And so I'm curious where you find meaning in it and why you've chosen to do it.
962
I wanted to be a football coach and I was screaming to not come down to New York.
963
It all hit the peak when I was coming in through the, I drove down from Amherst down to New York to move into my one bedroom with three guys on 38th and 1st.
964
And I'm coming in the Midtown Tunnel and my tire pops going into the Midtown Tunnel, moving all my stuff because I had so much shit in my stuff in my bag in the back of the car.
965
And I was like, I cannot believe I'm doing this.
966
And then getting on 4:30, 5 a.m.
967
trains up every morning to beat my boss to work because my stuff.
968
And my first boss, Jim Casberg, he'd get there super early and I couldn't beat him there.
969
And he had just had a fourth kid.
970
He was going to have his fourth kid.
971
The fourth kid ended up being triplets.
972
So they had six kids.
973
And now that I have three kids, I realize he wanted to get there first before anyone woke up.
974
So he, so I was competing with the house.
975
Yeah, I was competing with the six-kid household.
976
Yeah.
977
So that was like too hard.
978
But I went up there and my stepdad's like, just try it.
979
And I met with the founder of the firm and he's like, look, are you competitive?
980
Yes.
981
Are you good at math?
982
Yes.
983
Do you like new things?
984
Yes.
985
He's like, your blood's going to turn green.
986
Just come up here and do it.
987
For me, it was always about having a really good product, making good returns versus other people.
988
I wasn't so outcome focused.
989
I've always been about trying to make sure, like, authentically feeling like I have an idea or a product or something that's just very original and very what we believe.
990
And you can use a fund as a effectively a mechanism to actually take that view.
991
And the thing I loved about it too is that if you have good performance, I've always had the view that if you have good performance over time for long periods of time, that just you will have clients forever.
992
They trust you and you do what you say you're going to do.
993
It's like a pretty good framework for how to operate.
994
And if you can do that consistently for long periods of time, you'll always have it.
995
I didn't realize how much I was going to love the business from the beginning, which is like, where else can we be in the middle of compute, oil and gas, software, healthcare, being in the middle of all these conversations globally?
996
It is the eternal learning center.
997
And I don't think I could do anything else.
998
And then people ask me, you know, you ever going to stop?
999
I don't think I'm going to stop.
1000
So, my wife, she's incredibly healthy.
1001
She also has a great way of finding very special things.
1002
And as like anything that is special, I love to be a part of the building of something special, something unique.
1003
And I like sharing things that are unique.
1004
First is the, every time you order an avocado in New York from Instacart or order in, like half of them are not bad or bad.
1005
There's this guy called the avocado guy.
1006
And he like, yeah, yeah.
1007
And he's like, duh, avocado guy.
1008
You guys can go get it right now.
1009
It's like probably, I don't know, it's probably 50 or 100% higher than a regular avocado.
1010
But every avocado is perfect.
1011
Yeah.
1012
So no matter what, back to your idea on young ideas, anything that is unique, special, solves a problem, you can have a business.
1013
The avocado guy.
1014
Blueberries, my wife found this farm down in Florida that makes blueberries once a year.
1015
Harvests, you can order five pounds once a year.
1016
You got to order it the day of.
1017
You just missed it, everybody.
1018
I actually don't know the name of the farm, but it harvests it once a year.
1019
Blueberry guys.
1020
Duh, blueberry guys.
1021
We get them, and I had them the first year.
1022
And literally, you can't eat other blueberries because they're so good.
1023
And I'm like, okay, you can't.
1024
And then now I started sending them to people on the floor.
1025
So I sent on the Zelda.
1026
The people on the floor are all getting very five.
1027
And then they're like, why are you sending me blueberries?
1028
Just a message around just, it's really unique, really special.
1029
That's how you build relationships.
1030
Anything good.
1031
Anything good is around that.
1032
And I give all the credit to my wife, obviously, on anything health-related, but also just these jobs are impossible.
1033
If you don't have someone at home that's supportive and just full trust.
1034
It's been so cool learning from you over many conversations because Apollo is this sort of monolith that you might think was a private equity firm.
1035
Maybe you thought it was in credit.
1036
It was doing just mid-market sponsor-back deals.
1037
And it's obviously turned into something much different.
1038
And so it's been cool for me to learn about it.
1039
I'm glad that everyone else listening gets to learn about it as well.
1040
When I do these, I ask everyone the same traditional closing question.
1041
What's the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you?
1042
My stepdad, who went to Westborne, we were talking about him earlier.
1043
I was with my mom and stepdad for most of my life, but he said a ton of structure and really always treated me like his own.
1044
Now that I have three kids, it's hard to thank someone enough for that.
1045
Amazing.
1046
Great place to close.
1047
Thanks for your time, John.
