1
Today I'm speaking with Daniel Dreyfus, founder of Borneo Capital, about one of the most important investment stories of our time, the rebuilding of America's power infrastructure.
2
For decades, power demand in the U.S.
3
was flat, but that's changing fast.
4
Driven by electrification, the reshoring of manufacturing, and the energy demands of artificial intelligence, the country's aging grid is being pushed to its limits.
5
To keep up, we'll need trillions of dollars in investment, tens of thousands of miles of transmission, and a comprehensive energy strategy.
6
This isn't just an upgrade, it's a full transformation.
7
Dan has been ahead of the curve in identifying the companies and commodities that will shape this next cycle.
8
In our conversation, we talk about where he sees opportunity, what risks he's watching for, and how to separate real value from hype in a moment that feels both urgent and uncertain.
9
It's a conversation about power, capital, and the stories we tell when we're building something big.
10
Dan, you've said that President Trump's mantra should shift from drill, baby, drill to build, baby, build.
11
What, in your view, is the essence of that shift?
12
I think that shift has happened and is happening, Jawad.
13
If you look at his policies, I think, number one, the whole idea behind the tariffs, the genesis behind the tariffs, the outcome he wants from the tariffs isn't just to raise prices for the consumer and do harm to other countries.
14
The end game here is he wants to reindustrialize America.
15
And it's incredible to look at the history of industrial production in America.
16
Prior to 2000s, for decades and decades and decades, industrial production growth mirrored GDP growth.
17
If it was a stock, industrial production had a one beta with GDP growth.
18
Then in the year 2000, when China entered the WTO, that relationship completely broke down.
19
And industrial production grew at a 0.25 beta to GDP growth.
20
And it stayed that way, really, up until now.
21
And clearly, there is causation here between China entering the WTO and the globalization trend and the offshoring trend that we've all lived through for the past 20 years.
22
And I think it has done structural damage to our economy.
23
I don't think we need to manufacture everything in the U.S., obviously, but there are things that really we should be manufacturing here that we're outsourcing overseas.
24
We should have more semiconductor fabs here.
25
We should have more gigafactories here.
26
We should have way more life sciences facilities and pharmaceutical manufacturing here.
27
It's outrageous that we're importing 60% of our penicillin needs from China.
28, there's plenty of industrial activity that is advanced, high-paying.
29
Americans would love to have those jobs.
30
And I believe that that is Trump's end game, what he's trying to accomplish with these tariffs to incentivize companies to come and build here.
31
Now, the reason I say build, baby, build instead of drill, baby, drill is we're moving away from liquid hydrocarbons to electricity.
32, there's a saying recently that semiconductors are the new oil.
33
Well, semiconductors live in one place, which is a data center, and or electric device or whatever.
34
But whatever you need a semiconductor for, you have to plug it in and it consumes copious amounts of electricity.
35
And so, if you take the oil, semiconductors is the new oil catchphrase one step further, what that effectively means is electricity is the new oil because electric power powers every semiconductor.
36
And if we're entering a world where we're trying to reindustrialize America and we're trying to be the global leader in AI, the problem is, and the gating factor here is that we have such a severe infrastructure deficit in this country that we're going to be unable to bring all these factories back at the pace we want them to.
37
We're going to be unable to build all the data centers that consume copious amounts of power that we want to because we've underinvested in our infrastructure for so long.
38
And now we're at the dawn of a multi-decade reinvestment cycle to catch up and get with the new world.
39
And this is squarely in line with what I believe Trump wants the end game to be.
40
So, yes, drill, baby, drill is a thing of,, it's, okay, boomer, that's a thing of the past.
41
Today, it should be build, baby, build.
42
That's what he should change the phrase to.
43
So, power demand grew just 0.35% over the last 20 years or 8% in aggregate.
44
Electricity is the fastest-growing portion of the energy mix now, as you pointed out.
45
How would you characterize the scale and urgency of the current grid and power infrastructure needs?
46
Red alert.
47
I think we should have been prepared for this and we're not.
48, much industrial production growth, which used to grow in line with GDP and then completely collapsed over the last 20 years when China came into the picture, it's a very similar trend with electrical consumption, electrical power consumption.
49
If you go and look at the 50s, 1950, 1960, 1970, there was an explosion of power demand because we started getting modern appliances, air conditioning, and power demand grew at a 2x beta to GDP growth roughly over that 20-year period.
50
Then, throughout the 80s and 90s, it converged to roughly one-to-one.
51
GDP growth would be X, power demand growth would also be X.
52
But then, starting in 2000, very similar to industrial production, and probably not coincidentally, because industrial production is a large consumer of electrical power, that beta of power growth to GDP growth fell again very similar to industrial production growth, something to 0.2, 0.25 times GDP growth.
53
But there was also something else going on over the last 20 years, in that we were going through a golden age of efficiencies from power consumption.
54
So think of LED lighting, think of smart appliances, think of tinted windows, think of smart HVAC systems, smart buildings.
55
And all of this was masking what true apparent organic power demand was because we were flooding the market with new products that were incredibly efficient from a power consumption standpoint, while at the same time, we were tearing down all our power-hungry factories and moving them to China.
56
And so we went through this 20-year period of effectively no power consumption growth.
57
And the companies that were the picks and shovels and the arms dealers to the power industry and the power producers themselves went through a very, very brutal 20-year period.
58
There was a big overbuild of power in the early 2000s, and then there was no growth for 20 years.
59
And so what that did is it created bankruptcies, consolidation, and really a significant lack of investment.
60
But now you fast forward to today, and we're coming into an era that's going to look very similar to that 1950 to 1970s period where we were introducing to the world all these fancy high-tech appliances that consumed all sorts of power and power demand grew at a two to three beta to GDP growth.
61
Today, we are electrifying intelligence, right?
62
Data centers, we all know, consume huge amounts of power.
63
We're electrifying the transportation fleet, right?
64
Waymo and Uber taxis that are going to be,, they're all going to be electric and there's huge valuations betting on that future.
65
Buildings are moving electric.
66, every building in New York City doesn't want to get the D rating on their air quality, so they rip out the gas boiler and they replace it with a water pump.
67
That's all electric.
68
And so much that 1950 to 1970 period where we saw an explosion in electricity demand because of a one-time invention, a technological advance, in that case, it was appliances.
69
Today, we have transportation fleets, we have buildings, and we have data centers that I think are going to shoot this demand up really significantly.
70
And then you add on the fact that we're going to be reshoring advanced factories semiconductor fabs, life sciences facilities, giga factories.
71
These are all factories that are not data centers, but consume huge amounts of power.
72
This is not spoken about.
73
All people in the power space want to speak about as data center, but this part of the equation is just as important, if not more important, to the power consumption story.
74
And so we are going to be facing power deficits for decades to come because building out this infrastructure happens in geological time.
75
It does not happen in internet time where you press a button and it's done for you.
76
It happens in geological time because you need people, you need equipment, you need permits.
77
And I think this is going to be the bottleneck of our reshoring objectives.
78
It's going to be the bottleneck of our AI data center objectives.
79
And it's going to be a bottleneck to robo-taxis and e-fleets.
80
There was a,, Travis Kalanik was on the all-in pod a few months ago, and they asked him, they were asking about why he didn't go heavy into AVs when he was running Uber.
81
And he says, the power grid can't remotely handle it.
82
If you look at California, and California went 100% AV, you would have to double the power consumption of the state.
83
Now, we all know California's grid is in horrific shape.
84, sadly, half of California seems to burn down every three years.
85
Six years ago was Paradise, California that took down parts of Napa.
86, we just recently went through some really bad fires in LA.
87
And when they do the forensics, when they did the forensics on Paradise, California, they found that that part of the grid that caught on fire, it was over 100 years old.
88
It barely works for what we use it for today, let alone what we need in the future.
89, same in Texas.
90
Anytime there's a little storm and that whole grid seems to go down, you've seen what's happening in Europe now and Spain with air power outages when you start to go and flood the grid with renewables that are intermittent.
91, this is very complicated stuff.
92
When power surges onto the grid and then there's points where power doesn't come onto the grid,, it really can fry the grid, which is really what happened in Europe.
93
And if we get to a certain number of AVs and EV penetration, and everybody comes home at six or seven at night and plugs their car in, the grid in its current state today will be fried.
94
It'll fry the grid.
95
It'll crash and it'll burn.
96
And so, Jawad, there is a lot of work that we need to do to get to where we want to be.
97
And it's going to be very infrastructure intensive.
98
If the last grid upgrade cycle was in the 1960s, what's the state of the current infrastructure?
99
You pointed to some anecdotes, but across the country.
100
It's very antiquated.
101
It is in desperate need of modernization and hardening.
102, we're having more and more natural disasters,, floods and hurricanes and bad storms.
103
The grid can't handle what we need it for today.
104
And I firmly believe that with the advent of artificial intelligence, which is going to make its way into white-collar labor through agentic solutions, it's going to make its way into blue-collar labor through robotics.
105
It's going to make its way into medicine.
106
It's going to make its way into the military.
107
It's going to be so critical to the future that I believe that the success of a country going forward is going to be measured by how much electricity it can produce.
108
And the bad news is that on that basis, China is light years ahead of us.
109
The China National Grid, which is the largest buyer of copper on the planet, has been spending giga dollars modernizing, upgrading, expanding their grid for the last 20 years, while we've spent the last 20 years because there was this illusion that power demand wasn't growing anymore because we were going through some efficiencies and we were tearing down electrical intensive factories, we spent the last 20 years investing zero in our grid.
110
So I think there's going to be a really big catch-up, a really big focus.
111
I think it's going to be completely immune to whatever else goes on in the economy.
112
The U.S.
113
consumer can roll over.
114
Spending on getting to where we need to be in modernizing this infrastructure is just going to be up and to the right, almost independent of what else happens to the rest of the economy.
115
So, in other words, uninterruptible zero-carbon power has become one of the scarcest and most valuable resources on the planet.
116
You break down the opportunity across three areas: hard assets, picks, shovels, and critical materials.
117
Could you elaborate on each?
118
Sure.
119
So, critical materials are the commodities that you need to mine.
120, everything that we touch and use every day has been mined somewhere.
121, you mine really for oil.
122
That's what a well is.
123
That microphone you're speaking into, you had to mine the metal.
124
Agriculture effectively is mining the soil.
125
And we identify the upstream commodities that are effectively mined, or in some cases, mined and then processed, that we see big supply-demand imbalances, large deficits in the future.
126
These commodities, again, to bring this supply on, they come on in geological time.
127
And for a number of them, it's too late.
128
The lead times to build these, bring on the supply of these commodities, of certain of these commodities, is so long and the demand for them is so visible over the next few years that it's very easy to see that the supply of these commodities are going to be a large pinch point.
129
I've been a long time structural bull on copper and I continue to be.
130
I think that the copper price is very undervalued, but there's also other interesting commodities out there as well.
131
I think there's some nickel alloys that are going to be a pinch point and slow down the lines at Boeing and Airbus because you need these to make the planes and there's just not going to be enough of it.
132
I think there's a potential for natural gas to become very, very, very tight or very expensive and slow things down.
133
So we try to find the critical minerals that are really the pinch points in the supply chain.
134
Because if you can identify the pinch point of any supply chain, that's what you want to own.
135
And you get bonus points if that pinch point doesn't cost the manufacturer that much money to pay up for it.
136
It's a small portion of their overall cost because they'll pay up.
137
They'll pay up 2x, 3x, 4x.
138
They don't care.
139
They just want the material.
140
And so that would define our critical minerals vertical.
141
And then the second vertical that we focus on is power infrastructure.
142
And I think we've spoken about that a little bit, but that would include the picks and shovels manufacturers,, the companies that make switchgear, voltage regulators, transformers, that thing.
143
It would be the makers of the combined cycle gas plants.
144
It would be the existing power producers where there's PPE in the ground.
145
And,, ironically,, tariffs is bad for a lot of industries.
146
Tariffs are bad for a lot of industries.
147
For PPE in the ground, whether it's an existing power plant, the third vertical that you touched on is just more traditional infrastructure, oil pipelines, gas pipelines, and so forth.
148
Those in an inflationary environment, existing PPE in the ground, if you have a legacy nuclear power plant or a legacy gas-fired power plant or a legacy oil pipeline or a legacy natural gas pipeline, with the inflation that we've experienced over the last five years, coupled with the inflation that we're going to experience from tariffs, the cost to build a new gas plant has tripled over the past 10 years.
149
The cost to build two gigawatts of nuclear-fired capacity in the U.S.
150
would probably be about $30 billion dollars today.
151
The cost to build a new pipeline,, we have an example of a big oil pipeline that was recently built in Canada.
152
It cost $40 billion.
153
It was,, grossly over budget and delayed, but all of these things are.
154
And what that means for existing PP and E in the ground, PPE is property plant and equipment, by the way.
155
What that means for existing steel in the ground is that becomes just dramatically more valuable.
156
Because in order to green light a new build of a pipeline or a power plant, you need to justify that new build by running your model with a certain power price or a certain tolling fee that you charge to move the gas or the oil over the pipeline.
157
And when the price to build a new build goes up exponentially, 2x, 3x, 4x, then that simply means that the price of the commodity or your tolling fee has to go up a lot as well in order to justify the new build, because if it doesn't go up, you're not going to build it.
158
And we all realize that we really need this stuff.
159
And so the legacy assets that have very long,, useful lives of 50 plus years, they benefit from that pricing umbrella that's going to come their way without any capital outlay whatsoever.
160
And so in a world of tariffs, which are going to be inflationary to build new large-scale industrial projects, existing legacy infrastructure is going to be a big winner.
161
And so, really, when you look at the three things that the Trump administration is trying to go for, reindustrializing America, number one, we have a big infrastructure deficit, infrastructure wins.
162
Winning the AI race, number two.
163, that is incredibly infrastructure-intensive.
164
And then, third, in his policies, he obviously has tariffs, which are inflationary and challenging for a lot of other industries.
165
But that's music to the ears of a company that owns existing PPE in the ground today because they just know that when it's time for recontracting what their infrastructure is used for, they're getting a big price increase for no capital outlay.
166
Zero capex, zero op X.
167
It flows down to the bottom line at 100% incremental conversion ratio.
168
Given the long wait times in project development and record backlogs, how much visibility do you have into how long this infrastructure investment cycle could last?
169
Decades.
170
This is not going to be a three, five-year cycle.
171
This is going to be 20 years, maybe more.
172, I think that delta is going to be a function of how far in we want to go and how much progress AI makes in terms of end use cases, because AI is very infrastructure-intensive and could obviously go on for a very long time.
173, as these inferencing models become more and more useful and the cost comes down, and you can do more with the same amount of tokens,, this is going to consume just copious amounts of infrastructure across the board, which we don't have right now.
174
And because it takes so long, and we don't have the people,, it's over the last 20 years, there's been a gigantic brain drain out of the real economy and into the digital economy.
175
I suspect most of us over the last 20 years would have told our children to go and study coding as opposed to going and studying how to become a linesman or on a production line or a welder.
176
And now I think that narrative might be flipping a little bit because coders are becoming commoditized through artificial intelligence.
177
And,, linesmen and welders,, people who work in the real economy, you should see the compensation packages that are being offered right now.
178
And that's really being compounded by Trump's immigration deportation policies as well.
179
There's a real shortage of skilled labor.
180
So how do you train a whole generation of people overnight?
181
You can't.
182
And this is why it's going to take a really long time.
183
And this is why the infrastructure aspect of it is going to be the bottleneck to both reshoring and AI.
184
Where are you seeing the most persistent bottlenecks, whether it's permits, labor, materials, and how do they shape the outlook?
185
The bottlenecks today are in labor and materials.
186
If you want to get a combined cycle gas turbine delivered to you, you're looking into the 2030s.
187
And that's why we need so much solar right now, because it takes 10 years plus to build a nuclear plant.
188
You're going to have a hard time finding a baseload gas-fired generator, get the parts for that and the equipment to build that.
189
And so we're going to have to build a tremendous amount of solar to bridge us until we can build more structural, stable,, 24-7 baseload power.
190
And that's really where the shortage is.
191, these companies, so many of them, I remember when GE Aerospace about a year ago spun off GE Vernova, the perception was that everybody would sell GE Vernova because this was the unit that nearly bankrupted GE along with their financing division.
192
It was the dog of the portfolio.
193
And it was, it had been bad, so bad for so long that there's been so much underinvestment, both from a human capital standpoint and from an actual PPE standpoint of investment in factories, that that is by far and away the biggest bottleneck.
194
And it's whack-a-bole.
195
Every time you try to find a solution, another problem with the supply chain shows up.
196
So it's clear that we're going to have a big power deficit.
197
So we've got to build as much solar as we possibly can to put a band-aid over this, the deficit that we're going to be going into over the next few years.
198
And then you realize that these photovoltaic cells that you need for,, to build out solar consume tremendous amounts of silver.
199
Now, the silver market is already in deficit and it's being compounded by the fact that precious metals are now becoming a currency again after the weaponization of the US dollar.
200
Countries, instead of putting all their stack in treasury bonds, or maybe putting 90% of their stack in treasury bonds and now 10% in gold, but it only takes a very small amount of allocation away from treasury bonds into precious metals to cause the price of precious metals to go up substantially, just given the relative size of the two markets.
201
And silver has always been viewed as the poor man's gold.
202
So it has a derivative application as a currency at a moment in time when there is clearly a push to diversify a little bit out of the U.S.
203
dollar and treasuries into precious metals.
204
And this is happening at the exact same time where the industrial use for silver is exploding, not just for photovoltaic cells in solar, but also in semiconductors and all these other industrial applications that are growing very, very, very quickly right now.
205
So this, again, the bottlenecks are very real.
206
It's commodities, it's labor, it's factories, and it's going to take time.
207
Public infrastructure assets often trade at a discount to private market valuations.
208
What do you think explains that gap?
209
And how do you see it closing?
210
I think the private equity firms have done a phenomenal job of telegraphing what I'm talking about today: about how there's a very large infrastructure deficit, and they are the right firms to go and help address that infrastructure deficit.
211
And I think that's true.
212
I think there is a huge role for private equity, and they should be raising a lot of money because that capital will see very good returns, very long-duration returns, very appropriate for private equity because a lot of these cash flows are take-or-pay type contracts that don't have a lot of economic volatility and sensitivity.
213
So you can lever them, which is good for private equity to enhance their returns.
214
So it checks all the boxes And their marketing teams have done just a phenomenal job raising money to go and allocate to this space i would say in the public markets i think it's been less effective in in telling the story and raising money for allocating to public securities because i think it's a relatively new phenomenon and importantly though critically the net result of this has been that where we see transactions in private equity being done whether it's a new build or whether it's buying assets from company xyz And And bringing them private everything in private equity land that we see trades at a very significant valuation premium to what we can buy in public equity land and i think that's just a function of there being many many many multiples the capital chasing this idea or chasing this thematic through private equity than there is through public equity and that obviously creates opportunity for those who want to look to to capture this opportunity through public markets because you can own it at a discount to where things are transacting in private markets and you get the liquidity is there any political risk especially with related to federal infrastructure spending i don't think so.
215
I think that,, it's interesting.
216
Transportation Secretary Wright went through the IIJ, the infrastructure Investment and jobs Act, and there was a whole bunch of garbage in that bill.
217
But there was, out of the $1.2 trillion bill, there was $350 billion allocated to modernizing roads, bridges, highways.
218
And Trump saw the bill and the Treasury, the Transportation Secretary said Trump wants to double down on the hard infrastructure, the roads, bridges, the highways, and take the money to double down on it from all the other softer, fluffier stuff that really wasn't tied to infrastructure.
219
So I think there's a directive from the top that infrastructure spending is going to be at the bottom of the list of things to get cut.
220
Now, that's not to say there isn't stuff in the Inflation Reduction Act or the IIJA that are going to get cut.
221, I think hydrogen subsidies are gone.
222
I think EV subsidies are gone.
223
But I think there's a scenario where that money that they're saving from some areas of the bill gets reallocated to accelerating the build out of roads, bridges, highways, the grid, giving tax breaks and more economic incentive to factories to come and set up shop here.
224, you're seeing that from the administration already,, giving tax breaks on cars made in America.
225
I would say they're leaning into this,, as opposed to stepping away, even though they're trying to look for ways to promote efficiency and save money at the federal level.
226
The Constellation Energy CEO Joseph Dominguez questioned the conventional wisdom about dramatically increased energy demand that may outstrip supply and require a new wave of natural gas and other fossil fuel energy sources.
227
He noted that data center operators tend to shop the same data center to different parts of the country to determine whether it could be built most cheaply and with particular energy sources.
228
This can lead to a false assumption of many more new data centers for everyone than what gets built.
229
Have you stressed, tested your assumptions around AI demand not living up to the hype?
230
Yes.
231
So first I'll say to that comment, I love it when CEOs in a given industry are just terrified about overbuilding because that's effectively what he's saying.
232
He says,, some of these data centers might be double or triple ordering, so there's no way I'm going to go and build to orders that I don't have firm visibility on.
233
That's what happened in the 2000s.
234
During the deregulation phase, when Enron was in its heyday, all the IPPs went and built on spec, on speculation that demand would come.
235
And sure enough, people put in orders for demand, but as soon as they built the power plants, they pulled those orders.
236
And then there was a gigantic glut of power, which resulted in a wave of bankruptcies.
237
And a lot of the same management teams that are running these companies today, they've got the scars.
238, there's carcasses on the highway of many CEOs that fell into that trap.
239
And so that institutional memory is very, very fresh.
240
Those wounds are very, very fresh.
241
And none of these companies are going out and building capacity on spec.
242
They're going out and they're saying, okay, we'll build you capacity.
243
But what you have to do is enter into a binding contract where you're going to buy the power from us for 20 years at a fixed rate with some inflation escalators.
244
The most recent, obviously, famously, was Three Mile Island.
245
Remember in 1978, Three Mile Island, there was a nuclear reactor and it leaked.
246
There was a nuclear meltdown, effectively.
247
And they had to evacuate all the children.
248
Any woman who is pregnant had to evacuate.
249, it was a,, that's what gave nuclear a really, really bad name.
250, it killed the nuclear industry for 20 years because everybody said, I don't want one of these things in my backyard.
251
Here we are today, Three Mile Island, same nuclear plant that used to be a dirty word.
252
Now Three Mile Island is brought to you by Microsoft Azure.
253
But it gets better.
254
At the time where they signed that power purchase agreement, that PPA with Consolation Energy, by the way, the owner of Three Mile Island, the forward power curve, power prices in that region in the PGM were trading at around $50 a megawatt hour.
255
They entered into a 20-year take-or-pay agreement to buy power from Three Mile Island at $100 per megawatt hour.
256
That would be if the oil price was trading at $60 today, some company saying, I need oil so badly and I need visibility and certainty that I can get this oil so badly that, yes, I see oil trading at 60 on my screen and the futures are trading at 60 on my screen, but I'm willing to enter into a 20-year contract to buy oil from you at $120 instead of 60.
257
That's exactly what happened with this power purchase contract.
258
That's why I say electricity is the new oil.
259
And there is a panic right now amongst at the boardroom level of all of these hyperscalers about where and how they are going to get their next gigawatt of power to fund that next leg of growth from their AI data centers.
260
But none of the power producers, at least the publicly traded ones, are falling for this trap of saying, oh, we're just going to go and build it and you guys are going to come.
261
Those days are over.
262
The wounds are too fresh.
263
It's been so bad for so long that the only way these companies are building any new capacity is if they get a back-to-back take-or-pay agreement to buy that power.
264
And that's why the market is going to stay very, very tight.
265
And private equity might come in and do some spec capacity builds.
266
I think that would be a pretty risky endeavor.
267
I think it would be a difficult fund to raise money for, by the way, because all people have to do is go into their Grok and say, what happened to power prices in the early 2000s when companies started to build them on spec.
268
But maybe they do that.
269
We haven't seen really any evidence of that whatsoever.
270
So, I think the bear market of the early 2000s really has now come to be a huge asset institutionally for all of these companies because I think it really guarantees that we're not going to overbuild.
271
I'm going to say one more thing,.
272
Remember when the deep seek announcement came out, and there was just outright panic that the cost of compute was going to collapse and there wouldn't be a similar demand response.
273
And so, the demand for compute and the demand for power was going to collapse.
274
And it was a Black Monday style event for a lot of companies in the semiconductor verticals and the power infrastructure verticals as well.
275
It was the bloodbath that day.
276, we disagree.
277
We're in the camp.
278, it's a pretty easy debate that lower costs spur much more demand.
279
And there's some people that say lower cost won't.
280
I'm in the camp that it will, but who knows?
281
Let's put that debate aside for a second.
282
We were invested in all of the power infrastructure companies that we thought were the highest quality well before chat GPT was ever a thing, well before AI became a household name.
283
And that was really based on what we spoke about earlier.
284
We were anniversarying 20 years of efficiency gains, which were going away.
285
We were going to reindustrialize and reshore, which was going to start consuming more power.
286
And the transportation fleet and the commercial building fleet was going to start moving more electric.
287
And just based on that, this is before any AI whatsoever.
288
Just based on that, we saw really significant power deficits and a huge need for investment.
289
Then AI came along.
290
And today,, when you start looking at the needs for the AI data centers, the deficits almost become laughable as you go out into the later parts of the decade.
291
And so when DeepSeek came out, we said, let's just stress test everything and say that from here, there is going to be no AI demand growth whatsoever.
292
Again, a premise we do not believe in, but it was for a stress test.
293
And you could underwrite this whole industry and still generate a very, very attractive IRR, especially after the stocks had sold off really significantly from that node.
294
And by the way, still haven't recovered.
295
So we've seen a significant re-rating.
296
At what multiple level are they trading relative to the historical averages on the power side?
297
So these are long-dated assets where, for example, if you take a power, a nuclear merchant power producer in Pennsylvania, the Susquehanna plant that Talon owns,, they entered into a take-or-pay agreement with Amazon to build the data center and supply power to them at a higher price than where market is.
298
But that takes time to build.
299
And so they're under-earning today because they're not selling that power at the premium price.
300
And number two, the deficits are going to start getting bigger and bigger as time goes on.
301
And so power prices really have to go up.
302
And that's just going to take some time.
303, we to use the mid-cycle equilibrium price analysis for any commodity we look at based on the cost of a new build.
304
And for building a copper mine, given how expensive it's become, we think the equilibrium price for copper is $15,000 per ton, up from $9,000 today.
305
To build a new gas-fired baseload plant that's $2,500 or $2,300 a kilowatt to build, we think the equilibrium power price to justify building that new plant needs to be $75 a kilowatt hour.
306
And so when we put in those assumptions of what we think the right equilibrium price for the commodities should be, the stocks are very, very, very cheap.
307
So in the case of some of the power producers, we're talking about five times free cash flow in 2029, probably should be capitalized at 15 times by then because the deficits are going to continue into the 2030s.
308
If you're talking about an equipment manufacturer, you're looking at 10 to 13 times earnings later this decade.
309
I think these companies should get market multiples because they're very high quality businesses with recurring services revenues and very predictable cash flow streams in operating in effectively holographistic now industries.
310
I think they should get market multiples.
311
So that's the setup that we're dealing with right here.
312
And I would say one more thing that there's upside bias to all of this.
313, we're still underwriting relatively conservative demand assumptions, largely because we can.
314
But if AI really takes off, then I would say there's an upward bias to those numbers.
315
There's a history of build cycles getting ahead of actual usage, right?
316
So you're pointing to the railroads.
317
This era was about opening new territory.
318
Railroads were a game-changing technology back then, much cheaper than horses and wagons, and they made regional trade possible.
319
And the idea was simple: build a railroad, and land along the route would rise in value.
320
New towns, farms, and businesses would follow.
321
Profits came from land appreciation and freight.
322
And as soon as the railroad was planned, spectators rushed to buy nearby land, driving up prices that even before tracks were laid.
323
This cycle of speculation led to repeated booms and busts.
324
And then the telecom bubble in the 1990s was this big belief that internet traffic doubles every 100 days.
325
And so with the rise of the internet, the need for bandwidth exploded and telecom was cheaper and faster than traditional communication.
326
So investors believed that building out networks would unlock feature online businesses.
327
Companies that announced new networks saw their stock prices soar, which let them raise more money to keep building.
328
Raising stock prices seemed to confirm that value was being created until the bubble burst.
329
So to what extent,, with AI and power story intertwined for now, to what extent is this reliant on higher capex leads from the big tech companies?
330
And what,, do you think the big tech companies will keep accelerating their capex, or have we seen peak capex from a sequential standpoint?
331
Or does this continue cloud, where capex is just continued to increase year after year?
332
Well, I think you have to break it down into two components.
333
There's the traditional cloud migration, which I think is very separate from the AI data centers.
334
It's the AI data centers that are much smaller in scale today relative to the traditional cloud businesses that are going to be driving the vast majority of the growth.
335
And that was the whole deep seek moment debate is exactly as you said.
336
Is this going to continue?
337
And if it does, are we going to see a gigantic overbuild and huge amounts of overcapacity, which will require less build, obviously, as we grow into that overcapacity?
338
Or is this a moment where we're going to find so many use cases that it's just going to be up and to the right for a very long time?
339
I am in that camp, but that is not at all essential in any way, shape, or form to the thesis of having to build out power infrastructure.
340
AI is just one leg of a multi-legged stool.
341, don't forget, Jawad, there is a gigantic amount of reshoring going on behind the scenes.
342, we track mega projects that are sanctioned, and we define a mega project as anything over a billion dollars in capital.
343
If you add everything up, and they really started to accelerate post-COVID with the implementation of the IRA and the IIJ, all the stimulus bills, that number now is $1.6 trillion of projects in the queue.
344
Now, the exciting thing is that for the last two or three years, all of these projects were going through the permitting phase and the design phase.
345
Starting later this year and into 2026, and then for the next five years, they're going into the construction phase.
346
And that's the infrastructure-intensive part of it.
347
And this has nothing to do with data centers whatsoever.
348, Intel's building a $100 billion dollar semiconductor fab in Ohio.
349
The phase one CapEx is starting at around $30 billion.
350
TSMC is building three leading-edge semi-fabs in Arizona.
351
And then just recently, they came out and said they're going to add another $100 billion of fabs on top of this.
352
Samson's building a $20 billion semi-fab in Texas.
353, the list goes on and on and on.
354, there's every day there seems to be an announcement of a new LNG plant that's going up, and these consume a ton of power.
355
And so, really, the point I really want to underscore here: you do not need AI growth for this market to stay very good for a very long time.
356
AI is the icing on the cake.
357
And if we do go into an overbuild of data centers, those resources will simply be applied elsewhere to build stuff that we need.
358
I think the risk is simply that it could, it doesn't need for the long-term thesis, but it could just create near-term volatility, right?
359
Absolutely.
360
No question.
361
With the deep seek moment, right?
362
So, are there any early warning signs you're watching for potential overbuilding or bubbles in power or data center infrastructure?
363
We're watching everything.
364, we're looking at what the big hyperscalers are saying.
365
And as of right now, they're saying the opposite.
366
They're saying that they have more demand than they can supply.
367
I think these companies are very credible.
368
I don't think they're promotional.
369, when you cross the $3 trillion market cap, I think you don't need to put on the promoter's hat anymore.
370, you become a real business where I think you tell It is.
371
And we're going to watch.
372
We're going to watch if the use cases continue to increase, which they have been.
373
And we're just going to watch on a very granular level at the micro what's happening with supply and demand, just we do with any other commodity.
374, we've studied commodities and supply chains for 25 years.
375
That's our bread and butter.
376, we know how to look at supply chains and we know when imbalances, surpluses, and deficits start.
377
And right now, I can say with a tremendous amount of conviction that we don't see any potential for a surplus in the next few years.
378
That's not to say that can't happen after that, but right now, things look pretty good.
379
What role do you see for natural gas in the power banks over the next 10, 15 years, especially as renewables scale?
380
Well, renewables are really more of a band-aid solution because, as, they're intermittent, sun only shines part of the day, the wind only blows part of the time.
381
And it's a real nightmare to run a grid that.
382, again, look what's happening in Spain.
383
It's a disaster when you overly rely your old grid on,, over-index to renewables.
384
But we need to build renewables because there's no other solution right now.
385
The supply chains are so backed up for other sources of power.
386
But natural gas is going to be a very significant structural winner.
387
First of all, there is an explosion of natural gas export capacity out of the U.S.
388
to export it to other countries that are short gas.
389
And that serves two purposes.
390
Again, this is something that the Trump administration's policies, once again, are benefiting infrastructure.
391
So, exporting natural gas serves two purposes.
392
One, it allows the countries to buy the gas so they can generate more power to do what they need to do with that power in their country.
393
But, two, and perhaps more importantly in today's world, is these are gigantic dollars at play.
394
These tend to be 20-year take-or-pay contracts to buy gas, a certain amount of gas every year for 20 years.
395
And these are big dollars.
396
And so, what these countries can do when they enter into these contracts to import U.S.
397
gas is they can take that piece of paper that shows how much gas they're going to buy for the next 20 years and how much money that's going to cost, and then they wave it in front of the Trump administration and say, Hey, look, look, we're cutting our trade surplus with you aggressively.
398
Lower our tariffs.
399
And so, this is incredibly, this is a new dynamic in a post-tariff world, post-Liberation Day world, that has just created another driver for the bull case for natural gas.
400
Our analysis shows that demand for natural gas is going to grow somewhere between four to five BCF a day per year for the next 10 years.
401
That's a combination of LNG exports, coal plant retirements, higher exports to Mexico, organic power demand from reshoring and data centers.
402
And we don't really see where the gas ultimately comes from at a reasonable price because there's a lot of gas in this country in these shale plays, but the low-cost gas is going to start to get drawn down very quickly.
403
And then we're going to have to go into the tier two and tier three parts of the shale plays where it's just going to be much more expensive to get the gas.
404
And so our view is if you can own a very long-lived asset in the gas production market that has a long life of tier one production ahead of it, things are going to be very, very good for you for the next 10 years because I think the equilibrium price of gas is going to have to rise to much higher levels than we've seen in the past just by virtue of chewing through all of our tier one inventory into a very large demand pool.
405
Well, macro implications, Salford, it almost makes me think that we need to be watching natural gas prices more than oil prices because that's where you could see, or electricity prices particularly, as causing a pinch of the economy more so than traditionally what we looked at oil prices for.
406
That's right.
407
And perversely, there's this interesting negative correlation between natural gas and oil, because a substantial amount of growth in natural gas production in the U.S.
408
comes from the growth in oil production, because gas is a byproduct of oil.
409
When you drill a barrel of oil, you get a certain amount of gas alongside that.
410
And so as long as oil production was growing, there was this natural supply growth of natural gas that would come to the market almost at any price because the oil producers just wanted to drill the well for the oil and they didn't really care what price they sold the gas at because the oil was the high margin unit from that well that they were drilling.
411
Now in the world we're living in today where global economic demand growth for oil is clearly slowing.
412
Some of it's cyclical and some of it's structural.
413
In China there's a lot of structural demand headwinds.
414 their penetration of electric cars is going gangbusters.
415
And by the way they fuel their electric cars not just with gas but with coal as well.
416
I always to say that there's two types of Teslas.
417
There's one you drive around West Virginia.
418
That's not a green car that's fired with coal.
419
And then there's the other you drive around Quebec that's fired with hydro.
420
That's a green low emissions car.
421
China, they don't really care what they're fueling that car with.
422
They're doing it as a geopolitical tool so that they don't need to rely on oil imports.
423
And so we've seen a structural downshift in demand out of China, which was forever the biggest demand growth driver for oil, along with the cyclical headwinds.
424
While at the same time, Saudi Arabia and the UAE in OPEC are talking about increasing production into a weak market, just they did in 2019, right before COVID.
425
So they have a history of increasing production into weak markets, and they seem to be doing this again.
426
And if all of this comes together, where demand for oil downshifts a little bit and OPEC brings barrels onto the market, we could be in a couple of year period here of rough sledding for the oil price.
427
Maybe the equilibrium price has to go to 50 or maybe 45 in order to have shale production decline a little bit so that the market balances.
428
And that could last for a couple of years.
429
I think structurally the oil price should be higher than that, but I think we're going through a cyclical downturn because OPEC wants to start chewing through his spare capacity and bring those barrels back to the market.
430
Now, if that happens and shale oil production declines, then that associated gas production will also decline at the exact moment that we really, really need that gas.
431
So there's a lot of really interesting dynamics at play here.
432
I think they all align very positive for certain.
433
Certain.
434
You got to be very selective of these critical commodities, natural gas being one of them.
435
It's an interesting framework flip because, again, historically, higher oil prices were negative for the economy, but now perversely, as you're pointing out, it could be that weaker oil prices are negative for the economy because it raises natural gas price, electricity costs, and impsitu discretionary spending to a degree that's a beautiful way of looking at it.
436
Do you renewable stocks?
437
No.
438
There's not enough of a barrier to entry.
439
They're commoditized.
440
China can produce them at will, even with tariffs.
441
And I generally don't to buy industries that are protected by tariffs.
442
We do it sometimes, but as a rule, I to buy something.
443
My favorite companies to own are the ones where I have very significant visibility on what they're going to earn in the next one year, three years, five years, even 10 years sometimes.
444
And I just don't have that with the renewable space.
445
I think demand is going to be very, very, very good, but I think supply will match that demand, if not exceed it.
446
And so it's, to me, I think there's just better places to deploy capital.
447
When you look at the current industrial transformation, whether it's EV or AI, what lessons can we take from past revolutions the rise of the automobile to inform that view?
448
And I'm thinking particularly about your observation around Henry Ford and John Rockefeller.
449
Yeah,, I guess in 1916, Henry Ford built the Model T and demand went viral.
450, there's lines around the block for the Model T.
451
You could get it in any color you want as long as it was in black.
452
And Ford's stock went parabolic.
453
And then a whole bunch of copycats came and started to build internal combustion engines.
454
And then John Rockefeller came along and saw that there was going to be an explosion of demand for oil refined products and pipelines.
455
So he started the Standard Oil Company.
456
And he built this thing into such a giant that it would probably be the equivalent of if Amazon, Google, and Meta were one company today.
457
That's what Standard Oil was back then.
458
It was so big and so powerful that the FTC broke it up.
459
And spun out of Standard Oil Company was Exxon, Chevron, Conoco, Amoco, Arco, Valero, Esso.
460, every who's who of the oil industry today.
461
And you go back and you look over the last hundred years, it's been about 100 years since the Model T was in, since Henry Ford invented the Model T.
462
The Ford Motor Company stock has done nothing for 100 years.
463
Your IRR, your 100-year IRR for owning Ford has been zero.
464
Your IRR from owning Standard Oil Company and all the spin-offs and offshoots has been virtually infinite.
465, they've created trillions and trillions of dollars of wealth.
466
And I think today, if I'm right and electricity is the new oil, we could be at the dawn of something similar to what Rockefeller profited from.
467
You began you created gold mining, Dad.
468
So, how do you think about the upside for gold prices today, or what observations could you share based on your experience?
469
I started covering the gold stocks.
470
It was my first job in the finance area.
471
I studied finance and geology at school.
472
And in 1997, I got a summer internship at BEMO in the research equity research department working for the gold mining analyst.
473
And at the time, gold was trading at $300 an ounce.
474
Today, we're a little over $3,000 an ounce, so it's 11x.
475
But one thing I learned very early in my career is gold tends to track the percentage change of the U.S.
476
federal debt.
477
So, in moments when the federal debt starts to explode higher, gold prices also follow.
478
And it almost tracks it perfectly.
479, right before COVID, I think federal debt was somewhere a little over $20 trillion.
480
Today, it's $36 or $37 trillion.
481
So, it's nearly doubled.
482
And I think right before COVID, gold was around $1,700, $1,800 an ounce, and today it's $3,200 an ounce.
483
It's nearly doubled.
484, it's tracked that almost perfectly.
485
And so I think we're in a world of continued deficit spending.
486
I think austerity is going to fail at the federal level.
487
I think ultimately the way to inflate the problems away and the debt to GDP ratios that are elevated really is through inflation.
488
I don't think there's any other choice.
489
I don't think a democratic society will accept austerity.
490
And so I continue to believe that we're going to be inflating our debt away through spending, fiscal deficit spending, and that should be quite positive for the gold price.
491
Now, the gold price has had a move.
492
I've always believed that the equilibrium price for gold was somewhere between $3,000 to $4,000 an ounce.
493
And here we are in the low $3,000 range.
494
So,, maybe a little bit more upside, but I think we're closer to fair value than we've ever been.
495
And now we can get back onto algorithm and start growing the gold price in line with the federal debt.
496
How important is it to observe what China is doing?
497
Because,, Beijing has intensified its focus on environmental policies, particularly the 15th five-year plan that runs till the end of the decade.
498
The plan will move away from energy intensity tracking towards total carbon emissions.
499
What are they doing that is important for us to consider as we look at the commodity spectrum?
500
They are cutting off supplies of commodities that are going to be critical to our growth.
501
I have been shocked to see what they did with phosphate recently.
502
Phosphate is obviously the mineral of life.
503
You put it in the soil and crops grow.
504
It's a nutrient for the soil.
505
And China historically has been a very large exporter of phosphate.
506
Now, coincidentally or not, their exports of phosphate have gone to zero as this trade war rhetoric has really heated up.
507
And the farmers are really feeling it.
508
Now, what they say is they're making these LFP batteries, lithium-iron-phosphate batteries for their electric cars, which is consuming a very significant amount of the phosphate that they used to export so that farmers in the U.S.
509
and other areas of the world could use.
510
So that could be one explanation for it.
511
The other explanation could be they're holding back on fertilizers, on rare earths,, aluminum exports.
512
You're seeing those exports go down.
513, they put in an environmental policy saying they're going to cap their aluminum production basically at the amount they're producing today, which is a seismic event for the aluminum market because China single-handedly bludgeoned the aluminum market for the past 20 years.
514
They grew supply well in excess of demand, and aluminum has been a terrible commodity for 20 years.
515
But then they come out and they say, we're not going to build any more aluminum anymore because we use coal to build aluminum and there's 17 tons of carbon for every ton of aluminum we produce.
516
You guys in the West should go and build it because with your natural gas, you can do that for four tons of carbon for every ton of aluminum, or better yet, go do it with renewables or hydro for zero tons of carbon.
517
And we're out of that game.
518
And all of this is going to create shortages of commodities that we really, really, really need for what we're trying to accomplish.
519
And coincidentally or not, it's all coming together.
520
Some of it's happenstance, oil just happens to be going down right at the time we need natural gas and oil has always been positively correlated oil production growth has been positively correlated with natural natural gas production growth so i think you have to watch what China is going to do very, very closely.
521
I am in the camp that I think some level of tariffs are very good to incentivize good manufacturing coming back to this country.
522
So 10 to 20%,, I think is the right level.
523
I think trade wars are absolutely terrible.
524, all China has to do is cut off the supply of rare earths and penicillin.
525
And we have a national crisis here in the U.S.
526
on our hands.
527
And I'm worried about the direction this is taking and really hoping that we're going to have an off-ramp here, which I think we will.
528
I'm optimistic.
529
But we don't really know for sure.
530
But don't underestimate the cards, quote-unquote, cards that China is holding.
531
What underpins that optimism?
532
I think that everybody, maybe this is a little bit philosophical, but I think everybody on this planet ultimately wants what's best for their kids and grandkids and a world where we're cutting off critical medical supplies and rare earths to make our economies work.
533, that's just an outright act of war.
534
And I think we're going to avoid them.
535
And if we don't, things are going to get very, very bad.
536
I think there's a gigantic left tail in the market today that didn't used to be there, but is there today?
537
And I'm optimistic that there is going to be an off-ramp and we're going to get down to a level of 10 to 20% tariffs because I think that's the rational thing.
538
That's the rational outcome.
539
And usually, Jawad, over my career, the rational outcome has pretty much happened every single time we've had one of these scares.
540
So I don't think this time is going to be different, but that's a dangerous, or it's dangerous to say this time will be different.
541
So I'm saying this time won't be different.
542
So I think we're okay.
543
In closing, Dan,, energy is ultimately about connection, powering cities, families, dreams.
544
On a personal level, when you think about the idea of building, what are you most focused on?
545
Well, I've got some kids that are aspiring tennis and squash players.
546
And so I've been trying to build their dreams to make it up at the expense of my own body.
547
I tore my meniscus playing with them.
548, they're just beating me up so badly.
549
So I'm trying to build that.
550
I'm trying to build my business and having a lot of fun doing it.
551
And,, I'm turning 50 in November.
552
So I'm turning 25 for the second time is how I look at it.
553
And so I'm trying to build on my health and make sure I make it for another 25 times too.
554
I love it.
555
Thank you so much for sharing your perspective.

It was so appreciated as always.
