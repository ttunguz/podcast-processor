1
During my 25 years of Netflix, that was the dominant non-family thing in my life.
2
I think the big struggle we had in the early days was the contrast of loyalty and what that meant versus performance.
3
And we realized, okay, professional sports teams have a clear bargain of you're playing for your position each season, and it is a performance culture, but the team can be quite close and can be very supportive of each other.
4
And we came to think of loyalty as a stabilizer, but that ultimately it was about performance.
5
And that helped us clarify our own values that we were more valuing growth and achievement.
6
And then when you get that and everybody's working towards the company's success, it's a very powerful force.
7
Welcome to the Knowledge Project.
8
I'm your host, Shane Parrish.
9
In a world where knowledge is power, this podcast is your toolkit for mastering the best of what other people have already figured out.
10
Today's guest is Reed Hastings, mathematician, Peace Corps teacher, serial founder, and the contrarian behind Netflix.
11
In 1997, he mailed a single CD to himself to test a hunch.
12
Over the next 25 years, he led Netflix from postage-stamped DVD experiments to a streaming powerhouse that rebuffed an early Amazon buyout, published the viral 127-slide culture deck that codified radical freedoms and the keeper test, and placed audacious bets from a $100 million dollar commitment on House of Cards with no pilot episodes to greenlighting Squid Games, which became Netflix's most watched series on record.
13
Since stepping back as co-CEO in 2023, Hastings has applied the same playbook to Utah's Powder Mountain, branding it the uncrowded mountain, while doubling down on charter schools and AI tutors he calls venture capital for kids.
14
Throughout it all, he insists that culture is the true engine of scale and resilience.
15
Discover in this conversation how he builds and protects A-player cultures, outflanks giants by rewriting the rules, and ports Silicon Valley principles into brick-and-mortar ventures and classrooms alike.
16
I really enjoyed this conversation with Waureen, and I hope you do too.
17
It's time to listen and learn.
18
I want to start with what you're obsessed with lately.
19
Well, let's see, several things.
20
So, I would say during my 25 years of Netflix, that was the dominant non-family thing in my life.
21
And that was one big thing with tiny little stuff around the edge.
22
And now, my life is more varied.
23
So, I have a big chunk of focus on charter schools.
24
I'm on a half-dozen nonprofits.
25
Been working on charter schools in U.S.
26
education for two decades.
27
A big chunk on Powder Mountain, which is incredibly joyful.
28
And then smaller chunks on a bunch of other philanthropic projects.
29
I want to get into all of that.
30
Let's start with Powder Mountain.
31
You first visited in 2016, I believe.
32
Yeah, that's right.
33
We had a house in Park City for 20 years, loved skiing there, and then it got very, very crowded, as the whole industry has.
34
And Powder Mountain is not in the epic icon ecosystem.
35
And so it was uncrowded and blissful.
36
So it's become a great place for me to both enjoy.
37
So we went there in 2016 and then built a house that completed in 21.
38
And then I retired in 23 and then crazily bought the mountain.
39
How do we make that leap?
40
It's really hard for independent mountains to compete, I would imagine, especially in the era of Epic Pass.
41
And how do you go from casually skiing to buying a mountain?
42, I wasn't looking to do another capitalist thing.
43
It was definitely a save the mountain because I live there expression.
44
And we haven't done it yet.
45
So you're right that Epic and Icon are fascinating because they're great businesses and they've made skiing,, for $1,100, you get a range of options.
46
So it's really popular with skiers.
47
They sell,, 2 million passes apiece.
48
They generate,, a lot of the visitation and they're becoming bigger and bigger.
49
So from a commercial standpoint, it's what people want.
50
So think of it as the Costco of skiing.
51, you pay a fee and then you get great value.
52
And it's been very successful.
53
So I don't really have any critique of it.
54
But there's a sector of the market, maybe more Whole Foods is to Costco, that's a little more specialty.
55
So people willing to pay for uncrowded skiing.
56
And then that's super fun and you get wide open slopes and low lift lines, but it costs a little more.
57
Do you think that that's the future for independent ski hills?
58, you're either going to be one or the other.
59
You're going to be the mass market supermarket almost, or you're going to be niche high-end?
60
Yeah, I think powder and the other independents need to strongly counter-position or just become part of Epic Icon.
61
But you're not going to live as you were because you lose a third of your revenue and all of your profit to the Epic Icon family.
62
And it partially depends where you are geographically.
63
But as a general rule, you've got to counterposition quite strongly.
64
Do you think that that eventually becomes self-defeating?
65, if we walk through maybe a decade from now and you go to the mountain and the lines are too long, the food stations are crowded.
66 you don't have a good experience anymore, not even to mention the skiing.
67
There's no fresh tracks.
68
There's no and so people will opt out of skiing in general?
69
Or do you think that?
70
No,, again, if you're a historic skier and a purist, you might say, oh, Park City is really crowded now, but it's also a great value and you've got this great icon or Epic Pass.
71
And so far, the money does the talking and people are showing up and visitation is continuing to grow.
72
So it's been a very successful model of broadening the skier base.
73
You've always set culture as a founder.
74
So first with Pure and then with Netflix.
75
What's it coming into an existing organization and either changing or enhancing culture?
76
So in Powder Mountain and running that?
77, it's small enough, 150 full-time employees when I took over, that it's pretty intimate.
78
It's not taking over a substantial business.
79
So I suppose it's a little different, but not materially.
80
And what changes have you made with culture with respect to taking your learnings from Pure and Netflix?
81
And we'll get into this a little more later.
82
Sure.
83, for the powder story, we've done many changes on the positioning,, created a private skiing option.
84
We've upgraded the employee compensation, sense of mission, sense of winning, many aspects of it.
85
And have you brought the almost meritocratic focus of Netflix into the culture that you were famous for there in Two Powder Mountain?
86
Yeah, substantially.
87
So at Powder, I would say we've done, in my opinion, a slightly better job of it from the lessons that we've learned.
88
So in Netflix, there was the meritocracy and outsiders thought it was cutthroat, thought it was hunger games.
89
But inside, it really wasn't.
90
People looked out for each other, helped each other quite a lot.
91
But in the words we use to describe it, we're not warm and loving enough.
92
And so it came across as brutal from the outside.
93
And so we were never really able to shake that perception.
94
And in powder, we started with big-hearted champions who pick up the trash.
95
And so big-hearted, of course, loving and generous as the lead word in our employee motivation.
96
Champions,, no, we really do care about performance.
97
That's that meritocracy aspect, very driven, keep or test, all the things that we had at Netflix.
98
And then who pick up the trash is a symbol of self-responsibility and everything is my job.
99
And people really do pick up the trash in both metaphor and actual ways.
100
I always find that interesting.
101
I used to watch people when I worked in the government and they would push down into the trash instead, they would do anything possible instead of literally just taking the bag out of the trash.
102
And they would spend five minutes doing this, right?
103
And things would fall out and they'd pick it up.
104
And I'm just, what is wrong?
105
Just wrap the bag up and put a new bag in.
106
Yeah, everybody takes care of the trash at home.
107
And only some people do that at work.
108
Let's dive into a little bit of culture.
109
But, it starts with hiring, and this applies to Powder Mountain, Netflix, and all the companies and even the schools that you're involved in.
110
How do you go about finding the right people?
111
I would say pretty imperfectly.
112, you spend five or ten hours of interviews with someone and it's just hard to tell sometimes.
113
So I'm pretty open-minded.
114
We'll take a chance on people.
115
And then again, if it doesn't work out, we give them a package and move on.
116
So some people say all the focus should be on the hiring process.
117
And maybe they're able to do that incredibly well.
118
I've found it's hard to differentiate.
119
And so I'm willing to give people chances and let it be a little more instinctual.
120
And then,, then you're with them for months.
121
And then you can really tell their performance as opposed to from the five or 10 hours of interviews.
122
How long is it before you really form that first intuition?
123
Is it with somebody working directly with you?
124
Is it a week, two weeks into the job, three months, six months?
125 at what point are you, okay, this isn't going to work?
126
Well, it's rarely initially.
127
So, you almost always were in honeymoon,, for three months.
128
And then you might see some of the cracks start to appear of things.
129
And,, some of it is coachable and some of it is not.
130
So, you first lean in on that aspect and are communicative and clear.
131
And so, that's tended to work very well.
132
What was the highest value aspect of interviewing people or doing reference checks?
133, what was the one thing that you would say is the 80-20 of that?
134
I would say almost always I'll have a meal with them.
135
And it's how they interact with the service staff, the food,, aspects of humanity and character might be one of the most telling.
136
That's a really good way to do it.
137
A friend of mine also travels with them.
138
He'll go on a trip and see how they deal with the airport and the security line.
139, are they thinking in advance?
140
Are they frustrated by delays?
141
I always think that that's interesting.
142
How do you go about evaluating persistence or character?
143
Mostly by track record.
144, if they've moved jobs,, every 18 months, that's one pattern.
145
And if they've been,, six years and then three years and then seven years,, with someone, you can see that's their orientation.
146
They dig in and try to make it work.
147
So the past, again, for a more senior employee where there's a long enough run to be able to see those makes a real difference.
148
I remember listening to an interview.
149
I think it was even last night, right before I was going to bed, and you had mentioned reference checks.
150
How do you go about doing a reference check?
151
Yeah,, we rarely ask people for references because those are so animated.
152
So then it's climbing through LinkedIn histories, finding cross things, going to quite some lengths to get references that are more loyal to me than they are to the candidate.
153
Because again,, if you ultimately do all that and you end up with a candidate's brother, they're just going to say nice things.
154
So you got to find,, intermediates when you can.
155
Sometimes you can't.
156
Are there any tips or tricks for doing that that you've learned over the years?
157, do you go on LinkedIn and, who do we have in common?
158
Well, for sure.
159
But I'll go to their prior,, generally they're currently employed and that's not a safe place to go for them.
160
So then I'll look at the prior employer and then try to comb through and try to find people who work there who are probably new the candidate.
161
And then I'll reach out,, and try to get a conversation going.
162
And then only after there's a little conversation going, reveal that I'm calling as a reference.
163
Is there any particular question you find yourself asking over and over again?
164
Mostly it's the, would they hire them again?
165
If they wanted to come back.
166
And then once you hire somebody, what's the onboarding process?
167
Not differentiated.
168, we don't try to really specialize in making that great.
169, hopefully they get a laptop and an account and that all works.
170
But it's, I don't think there's much to do right or wrong in that first week.
171, it's just a full-on immersion.
172
And you take or don't, I guess, right?
173
Almost a transplant.
174
Yeah, well, we're very invested once we've hired someone that they do take and their manager is invested in it.
175
But I haven't seen anything really go wrong in the first week.
176
So it doesn't feel very error-prone.
177
I don't know what year you put out your first deck that got released.
178
I don't know if it was released or somebody.
179
2009.
180
I was, man, I want to work there.
181
I was, this is the exact type of culture.
182
So it almost has a selection bias, too, because I imagine people see that and then they opt in.
183
They want to be part of this meritocracy.
184
They want to be part of this culture of no rules and high trust and high agency.
185
Sure.
186
Well, we had an internal slide deck, and I would meet once a month with all the new employees as a group and then go through it.
187
So this is 2006, 2007, et cetera.
188
And most of the time, their managers had well-briefed them before they hired them on what we thought was important.
189
But once in a while, we'd get people who were in total shock.
190
And I realized, oh, it's unfair to this person that they got into something they didn't particularly want and that it would be better to give all the candidates the slide deck, going through the culture.
191
And then we realized, of course, once we're giving it to all the candidates, it's going to get public at some point.
192
So let's go ahead and just make it easy for the candidates by making it public.
193
And that's what led to that release.
194
But the reason it looked so unofficial, it's because it was just an internal comms deck to the new employee welcome.
195
But it made sense to put it out there so people knew what to expect.
196
That's right.
197
And then it had exactly the effect you referred to, which is the people who fundamentally wanted job security over growth were repelled.
198
And the people who wanted growth and willing to trade off job security loved it.
199
And so then we selected a very creative type of person who, again, was into performance and taking risk.
200
I think a lot about systems, how to build them, optimize them, and make them more efficient.
201
But efficiency isn't just about productivity, it's also about security.
202
You wouldn't leave your front door unlocked, but most people leave their online activity wide open for anyone to see, whether it's advertisers tracking you, your internet provider throttling your speed, or hackers looking for weak points.
203
That's why I use NordVPN.
204
NordVPN protects everything I do online.
205
It encrypts my internet traffic so no one, not even my ISP, can see what I'm browsing, shopping for, or working on.
206
And because it's the fastest VPN in the world, I don't have to trade security for speed.
207
Whether I'm researching, sending files, or streaming, there's zero lag or buffering.
208
But one of my favorite features, the ability to switch my virtual location.
209
It means I can get better deals on flights, hotels, and subscriptions just by connecting to a different country.
210
And when I'm traveling, I can access all my usual streaming services as if I were at home.
211
Plus, Threat Protection Pro blocks ads, malicious links before they become a problem.

228
One of the key ideas was talent density.
229
Talk to me about what that means and how you thought about it throughout the organization.
230
Yeah,, I think the big struggle we had in the early days was the contrast of loyalty and what that meant versus performance.
231
And,, everybody wants loyalty and they want performance and they're attention.
232
And so as we sorted through that, we realized: okay, professional sports teams have a clear bargain of you're playing for your position each season.
233
And it is a performance culture, but the team can be quite close and can be very supportive of each other.
234
And so that wrestling with, we came to think of loyalty as a stabilizer.
235
So loyalty gives you,, if you have a bad day, you don't get instantly fired.
236
Or if your boss has a bad day, you don't quit instantly.
237
You think things through solidly over,, a couple months.
238
But that ultimately it was about performance.
239
And that helped us clarify our own values: that we were more valuing growth and achievement than we were, say, lifetime loyalty, which is different than a family company or other relationships that we have, where we value loyalty in our friendships, in our marriage, and other things.
240
We value loyalty over performance.
241
Is it?
242
I remember an interview, I think it was Jamie Diamond who gave it, and he said, I want loyalty, but loyalty to the company first and loyalty to people second.
243
Yeah,, what he's getting at there is not a personal loyalty political factions where you look after,, your boss or something that, but you care about the organization.
244
And I do believe he's right that that creates a very powerful force.
245
And it only works if they see the leader, in that case, Jamie or was myself at Netflix, are clearly willing to sacrifice their self for the benefit of the company.
246
And then when you get that and everybody's working towards the company's success, it's a very powerful force.
247
How do you think about the notion Bill Belichick said,, I'm not collecting talent, I'm building a team.
248
I'm building the best team, not the most talent.
249
What's your initial reaction to that?
250
It's two zero sum.
251
I would say it's a little more of both.
252
But what he's trying to get the point across is building the team is a distinct operation.
253
But if you build the team from a bunch of high school football players,, that's not going to compete.
254
So,, but again, he's saying it dramatically to make a point.
255, it's saying only the paranoid survive.
256
And when Andy Grove said that for two decades, that was the phrase.
257
But it's not literally true because the paranoid are delusional.
258
Okay.
259
And they see everything as a crazy threat and they can't differentiate what's an important threat and what's not and what's reality.
260
Okay.
261
But,, it was a provocative and memorable statement to try to get people to be business leaders, to be more worried about what could happen to them.
262
Talent density isn't just about bringing in talent.
263
It's also about removing people who maybe the role has changed.
264
They're no longer suitable or they were never suitable to begin with.
265
How did you go about identifying and then removing?
266, one of the things that I think you did was severance packages, but you said, and correct me if I'm wrong here, that the severance packages were for managers.
267
They weren't for the employees because it gave the managers almost permission to remove people.
268
Sure, the money goes to the employee.
269
Okay.
270
It doesn't go to the manager.
271
But managers are generally selected because they have good human skills and they people.
272
And so it's very hard for them to let people go.
273
And so, if you are giving the terminated employee a big severance package, it makes it easier on everyone.
274
And so, that's one of the hidden benefits of it.
275
The other is getting a release.
276
So,, Netflix has let go many people.
277
And, maybe there's a few employee lawsuits, but hardly any, again, because the severance package is bigger.
278
And then we generally don't do performance improvement plans, which are a way to document the employee's poor performance so that you can win a suit.
279
Instead, why not just give them a check?
280
And,, there's so few people who get put on a PIP that then,, turn around that it's a, I think it's a false system of legal protections that doesn't work.
281
And again, it's better to give them a generous severance package, have them sign a release, and help them on to their next challenge.
282
Is there anyone that was either on a PIP that of that turned around, or anybody that you had formed an impression of after three months that was, this isn't going to work out?
283
And then it turned out to work out spectacularly?
284
Well, again, we didn't use pips, but I would say, are there people who got into a rough spot and got out of it?
285
Absolutely.
286
And the more someone was a longer-term employee, the more the rough spot was taken in context.
287
And we would try to say, okay, let's see if we can shift them into some other role and see if they can get back to,, being miraculous in that role.
288
You've said, and correct me if I'm wrong, processes can be the death of innovation, yet every company needs some structure as it scales.
289
How do you decide which processes to add and which to remove?
290
Yeah,, that sounds a long quote.
291
I would say it.
292
Let's tighten it up.
293
Look, manufacturing provided most of the GDP growth from the beginning industrial age, so 1800,, through to, I don't know, 1990.
294
Okay.
295
So 200 years, manufacturing is providing the GDP growth.
296
And manufacturing is about consistency, about driving out error, about incredible process attention, replication, perfection.
297
And it's not that they weren't ad agencies,, in the 1950s that were kooky and crazy.
298
They were, but it was a tiny part of the economy.
299
Okay, so the metaphors that we all picked up around process, think of way classrooms are basically organized factories.
300
Lots of things are organized factories because it was the prevailing metaphor.
301
And then the economy,, shifted a lot to, and higher value things were creative work and inventive and intellectual.
302
And for those things that are inventive, errors an inherent part of the process.
303
So think of it as in manufacturing, you want to drive out variation.
304
And in innovation, you want to increase variation.
305
And so process really is the language and model of driving out variation and getting to consistency.
306
And if you're in a safety-critical business, an airline, it's a good thing.
307
And if you're an inventive, creative business where your main threats are that someone else is going to invent something nearby you, then you want to minimize that and maximize The innovation a large part of the ceo's job seems to be rooting out bureaucracy how did you go about preventing that from creeping in well once you have let's take expense policies okay so most companies have policies you can spend 250 dollars in certain cities and more in tokyo and less in omaha and they're trying to save money right and they're trying to be careful with expenses and then you've got to have a whole bureaucracy to administer that to make sure people comply with that to educate them and whatever and we got rid of all that and we just had to travel as you would on your own nickel and i'm sure there's occasionally some expense that gets done that shouldn't be but compared to the cost of enforcement it's 90 so again that's more of our freedom and responsibility approach i that approach better because it treats people adults yes and you in treating people adults you want to set some context of what we mean by that and give some principles and examples but yes you're again it's getting away it's moving from the industrial model to the knowledge worker model and yet many of our corporate forms haven't adjusted fast enough to The basic work how did you go about recognizing good judgment i think people take bets about what's going to work.
308
And if they do end up working, then we say they have good judgment.
309
So I think we recognize it by by them making unusual choices and having those be quite successful.
310
I think of it advantageous divergence.
311
You go against the crowd and you're correct.
312
That's right.
313
And in those moments, do you think judgment can be taught?
314
I think so.
315, I,, to varying degrees.
316, it's music or something, which is everybody can learn some music.
317
Probably only some people become fantastic at it.
318
But you need some teaching in it for sure.
319
It's not just, it's not spoken language where it's so wired into our biology, everybody learns to speak.
320
Let's talk about Netflix for a second.
321
You left the co-CEO role.
322
You're now on the board.
323
How hard has that been to walk away from something that you created and not be hands-on and not be in the weeds and to be sitting on the board?
324
It hasn't been hard at all, partially because Greg and Ted,, were with me for 20 years and they were very ready.
325
And so it was exciting for them to get the opportunity that I had,, to have the responsibility and to manage so much global complexity.
326
So I was excited for them.
327
And,, they've done a great job these last two years, so that helps.
328
And then in terms of my own time, it was nice just decompressing and then spreading my focus,, around these different philanthropic and then Powder Mountain efforts.
329
Can you maybe riff a little bit on the competitive landscape of online streaming?
330
Well, it's,, very broad.
331, everything from YouTube,, to HBO.
332
And then in every nation, it's a little bit different.
333
There's a lot of national networks.
334
And so Netflix earns,, depending on the country, 5% to 10% of television viewing.
335
And so we got a long way to go.
336
And as we say inside, we lose most of the time.
337, we don't win the majority of television screen time.
338
So then it's, okay, what are the types of entertainment that we can do and how well can we do them to earn more time?
339
And is that part of the move into gaming?
340
It's moving into gaming, unscripted content.
341, initially, we were just film and not even in TV.
342
So, yes, we've expanded category by category to see where we can earn more time or,, do a better job than anyone else in entertaining our members.
343
Do you think it's inevitable that live sports becomes part of that?
344
Well, on Christmas, we had two NFL games.
345
So I would say it is part of that.
346
It's one of the things that Greg and Ted have done because I was always very skeptical, not, of course, of the viewing, but that there could be a good long-term proposition there.
347
And they've proven me wrong and have found good models where it makes sense for Netflix, the company, and, of course, for all the members.
348
One of the interesting shows that you guys did about F1 Drive to Survive, is that what it was called, correct?
349
You turned a whole country really onto an industry.
350
And it's so interesting to me because you single-handedly changed the trajectory of F1 across the world.
351
Not that it was bad before, but you definitely increased the slope of adoption and interest.
352
And you captured so little value of that on a value basis.
353 billions of dollars accrued to F1.
354
And I'm positive you guys didn't make billions of dollars out of that show.
355
How do you think about that and your role in driving eyeballs and attention?
356
Well, look, F1's been working hard for 50, maybe 100 years,, building up.
357
So they deserve that lion show that it is certainly true that when we set a show in a context and then the show works as Drive to Survive did, then it popularizes that thing.
358
But if we, it doesn't bother us that they profit from it any more than if we did a show that was set in farming and,, and then all these people are growing apples.
359
It's, okay,, in other words, we're looking to have incredible entertainment and F1's an incredible context for that.
360
So it doesn't bother us that they bet on us and then we delivered.
361
I guess where I was thinking about that is, do you envision any future in the next 20 or 50 years where maybe you buy a sports team or a franchise or you could have bought F1 before this and then made the show and then captured that advantage to you, also had exclusive broadcasting rights and all of these other things and they tie together.
362
Well, you'd have to ask Greg and Ted about that.
363
They will be the ones trying to figure out: does that make sense in our continued growth and stimulating entertainment or not?
364
The other show that I want to talk about is the Dave Chappelle, caused a lot of controversy.
365
How is that handled internally inside Netflix, and how do you see your role in terms of what you err or don't err?
366
Sure.
367, back in 2018, 2019, let's see, we probably did our first Chappelle special in 2015 or 14.
368
So we had a great relationship with Dave and had done a number of his stand-ups, and they were super popular, some of our most popular stand-up shows.
369
On the same hand, we were trying to be very inclusive and to have many people be able to thrive at Netflix's employees, including our transgender employees.
370
And so the tension became: we said to our trans employees and their allies, hey, we're very trans friendly.
371
If you're fantastic at your job,, again, it's great.
372
And we're an inclusive place of work.
373
And then some of them felt that in doing the Dave Chappelle show, which had some trans jokes, which I don't believe that Dave is anti-trans, but he definitely takes on some of the issues, that they were being undercut as employees.
374
We were creating a hostile work environment, which got them to protest internally.
375
So that was the storm in maybe 2019.
376
And it was good for us to realize that we were not resolving this conflict between customer entertainment and employee values.
377
So, for example, in many of our shows, people have guns and blow people up and shoot people.
378
And yet we don't want a workplace that's filled that.
379
And so we realized entertainment is an escape where various things get said and done that are not endorsing that as workplace behaviors.
380
But we hadn't really clarified that.
381
And so we sat down and we did an amendment to the culture memo and tried to really explain that entertainment is not always going to be stuff that you love or that you emulate or is admirable.
382
There's lots of stuff in entertainment that's not admirable.
383
And if you don't want to be in the entertainment business, that's fine.
384
But if you do, this is a core part of entertainment.
385
And then because we clarified all those expectations,, a few people left, but for the most part, everyone understood that makes sense, that's the rules.
386
And we move forward together.
387
Maybe just riff on how you see the inclusiveness, DEI playing out in the workplace and how it could be better incorporated or, because there seems to almost be an anti-DEI movement at the same time now that's going on politically or within companies where people are questioning whether people deserve their roles just because they might be a minority or underrepresented.
388
And how do you think about all of this?
389
Yeah,, there's certainly the U.S.
390
federal government is leading this anti-DEI push.
391
I don't know how much it's affected Netflix.
392
Again, you'd have to ask Greg and Ted about that.
393
But I would say, in general, for us, we always focused on inclusion.
394
We never called it DEI.
395
For us, we want everyone who's a Netflix employee to be able to contribute at their highest ability because that's in our commercial interest.
396
So perhaps we can go as far out on a limb as,, some companies did.
397
But our inclusion efforts have remained strong.
398
And again, we want people to feel comfortable so that they can contribute at their highest level.
399
Most mornings, I start my day with a smoothie.
400
It's a secret recipe the kids and I call the Tom Brady.
401
I shared the full recipe in episode 191 with Dr.
402
Rhonda Patrick.
403
One thing that hasn't changed since then: protein is a must.
404
These days, I build my foundation around what Momentous calls the momentous three: protein, creatine, and omega-3s.
405
I take them daily because they support everything: focus, energy, recovery, and long-term health.
406
Most people don't get enough of any of these things through diet alone.
407
What makes Momentous different is their quality.
408
Their way protein isolate is grass-fed.
409
Their creatine uses Creopure, the purest form available, and their omega-3s are sourced for maximum bioavailability.
410
So your body uses what you take.
411
No fillers, no artificial ingredients, just what your body needs, backed by science.

Whatever the occasion, Effortless Elegance is right this way.
415
Because Hilton brings you new ways to stay, courtesy of the Nomad London.
416
And it doesn't stop at award-winning dining in a space draped in velvet and illuminated by vintage chandeliers.
417
No, this day goes beyond with unparalleled personalized service and attentive hospitality.
418
Oh, and did we mention that Nomad London can be booked using your Hilton honors points at Hilton.com?
419
Hilton, for this day.
420
I love this quote from you.
421
I have two religions, customer satisfaction and operating income.
422
Everything else is a tactic.
423
Talk to me about that.
424
Yeah,, there's another way to say customer satisfaction there is revenue, right?
425
That's the top line.
426
And the operating income is the bottom line.
427
So you want to be, I think Bezos is the one who said this best, to be very firm about certain principles and then very flexible on the tactics.
428
And then this is a specific application of that, which is let's try to think through things that grow customer happiness and also grow operating income.
429
And,, it's quite hard to do both of those.
430
It's easy to do one or the other at the cost of each other.
431
But the art of business is doing both of those better than your competitors do.
432
You put a $100 million bet on House of Cards, having never watched the pilot.
433
What gave you the confidence that that was going to work out?
434
And I think you beat out HBO for the show.
435
What data did you use?
436
How did you make that decision?
437
That was a big bet at the time.
438
Well, that's 100% credit to Ted Sarandos.
439
So Ted had been working with David Fincher and trying to develop some of these ideas.
440
The show was up for bid.
441
And then Ted put in this two-season bid, which was unheard of at the time.
442, HBO had a precedent where they don't do that.
443
So they didn't match.
444
And then that team, Media Rights Capital, went with us.
445
And it turned out fantastic.
446
But that really, all of that bravery is due to Ted Sarandos.
447
What data goes into those decisions?
448,, how did Ted make that decision?
449, there's some data, but I would say that's raw.
450
It's instinct that the thing you've got a partial script, you've got some casting, and you have to guess how good is that show going to be?
451
So to figure out what it's going to comp against in terms of your data.
452
So there's no real data that tells you.
453
That was an instinct call.
454
Is it harder to create content that hits or buy content that hits?
455
Well, if you buy content that hits, you're implying that it's never been shown.
456
So the later it is in the pipeline, okay?
457
The more it's just a sketch, boy, it's hard to tell.
458
The more it's a complete script, you can tell a little bit more.
459
The more it's a script and a cast, you can see a little bit more.
460
The more it's a script and a cast and some dailies, you can see a little bit more.
461
The more it's an edited, completed thing, then you can really take a guess, okay?
462
But you still don't have that much public reaction.
463
The more you've done test screenings, you can tell.
464
So at each stage, you get more information and you're more likely to be right.
465
But in all of the stages, it's a lot of judgment.
466
So, a simple case would be Squid Game.
467
So, we knew Squid Game would be big in Korea, or we highly suspected it would be.
468
But the fact that it took off globally,, was a surprise to us.
469
And we'd been doing it for 20 years.
470
So, again, there are some surprises in there, but you're increasing the odds each time you do these things of learning.
471
And the team's gotten better and better at learning which things are going to get really popular.
472
How do you go about using data, obviously, to inform what you're creating, but also allowing for serendipity and unexpectedness and variation?
473
As you would tell, if you're only using, we know people this based on their viewing habits, how much they watch, where they stop, all of this stuff, we can create more of this pretty easily.
474
How do you think of that in terms of variation and surprise and new innovative shows or ideas?
475, we stimulate a lot of judgment of people trying new things.
476
And sometimes we celebrate the failures that don't quite work because they,, again, you got to be willing to have people try things.
477
And it doesn't really work in entertainment to say, let's do a show just that.
478
That rarely ends up successful.
479
So there's not much risk of going for that because it's not a good commercial path.
480
How much data do you collect on what I watch?
481, we have some basics, but it doesn't help us with the next show.
482
So the thing that's helpful is at the end of a Netflix show, you give a double thumbs up, single thumbs, or thumbs down.
483
We know you finished it, but maybe you thought it sucked.
484
And so we really want to know what you thought of it.
485
So, that's probably the piece of data that helps the most.
486
I just want to let : my kids go in and they often mess up these little thumbs up, thumbs down things.
487
Sometimes I see these recommendations,, when they were younger, and I'm, Transformer.
488
I don't watch Transformers.
489, what?
490
Yeah, well, as kids evolve, us adults don't evolve that fast in our taste, but kids do.
491
So, well, they do it on purpose, right?
492
Yeah, yeah, and they totally hijack my YouTube too.
493
All these recommended videos.
494
I'm, what is going on here?
495
Talk to me a little bit about AI and maybe riff on how you're seeing it used today and how you see it being applicable.
496
And yeah, just walk me through a little bit of your thoughts on that.
497
Well, let's see, in a Netflix context, Ted and Greg really lead that work.
498, Ted's important quote about a year ago was,, you're not going to lose your job to AI.
499
You're going to lose your job to a producer who uses AI.
500
And,, it's a tool for people to use.
501
And hopefully, everybody will use it and raise the level of performance, just as they did with, say, digital filmmaking.
502
At Powder Mountain, we haven't found very many uses for AI yet.
503
So,, we use AI a little bit in marketing copy, but it's pretty minimal.
504
So I think there'll be,, a number of businesses that are impacted a lot and other ones that are impacted much less.
505
How are you using it personally?
506
As a search replacement.
507
So I tend to use Claude,, or Gemini or OpenAI where I would have you search.
508
So, in the ski industry, I've been learning a lot of things about lifts and lift,, cable strengths and other things that, and water systems.
509
And I'll be educating myself essentially through AI, through posing a bunch of AI questions.
510
Has it changed how you go about learning about these things?
511
Because skiing is an entirely new industry when it comes to lifts and cable strengths and.
512
Yeah,, I think 20 or 40 years ago, you'd probably have to go to some engineering textbooks or was very opaque about how to do that.
513
The rate of learning is much higher now because of AI.
514, first search, and that made a big difference for 20 years.
515
And then AI is really improving that.
516
You do a lot of work with charter schools.
517
I want to come a little bit higher level in a second, but how do you see AI playing out in the classroom and learning?
518
Especially,, I think AI for teaching kids is an awesome application.
519, generally you're in a classroom with 20 or 30 kids, and it's very hard for the teacher.
520
The kids are all at different levels.
521
And it's a very industrialized model.
522
All third graders are going to learn the same thing today.
523
And that really, again, that's for the convenience of the operator, the school, and for being able to handle mass education.
524
And AI offers the potential of every kid gets their own tutor and goes at their own pace.
525
So there's a lot of efforts going on now.
526
I'm on the board of Khan Academy, a nonprofit, that's really pioneering a lot of stuff with ConMego, helping other for-profits L-O-E-L-L-O that does a reading app that's amazing.
527
So if you have a five- to seven-year-old, it really helps the kid develop a confident reader.
528
The AI is very patient and will listen to the kid and then correct them and then help them get stronger and stronger in their reading.
529
So,, and we're scratching the surface.
530
So in the next 10 years, you'll be able to have a complete K-12 and probably university education with AI on a phone or tablet that will be really change learning.
531
So think of it as AI is getting more impactful in society, the standards of what people need to know and can know is much higher.
532
So we've really got to do this pivot to individualized education from mass classroom lecture style communication.
533
How do you see the role of the teacher changing in that?
534
Well, the teacher will evolve to be a little more a social worker and a motivator.
535
So they're not giving the instruction in that long-term case.
536
All the AI is doing that.
537
And they're doing the social-emotional learning.
538
Okay, so how do you interact with other students?
539
How do you do the project?
540
How do you sit still?
541
So think of them as becoming social-emotional experts.
542
And they're pretty good at that already.
543
And less subject matter.
544
What happened in 12th century England?
545
And,, and they're regurgitating the facts, which is a lot of what they have to know now.
546
So it's them becoming, again, specialized in the social-emotional side.
547
And then you've got this huge numbers of companies now are trying to do AI for education.
548
So it's a big scramble, a lot of competition, very exciting.
549
Yeah, I think it's going to be really interesting to watch how it plays out.
550 Synthesis tutor just got a state on board, signed on to teach math, and a whole country, I think El Salvador, starting in September, their whole country in the in past September, and the results are staggering kids are learning faster better they understand more yeah and again that the classroom model has so many inefficiencies in how it's organized how little learning happens that it's a great AI application to take on and then also young people are very adept at new technologies so it's got a double win so I think education will be one of the big areas transformed and everyone will be able to get a better education just as an aside I tell my 14 year old I think he could be a mid-level employee in most companies if they never saw him just based on his output alone yeah because for him AI is his arm he's been using it since he was young and it's just second nature and he knows how to how to work that and I think and the danger for a 14 year old that is then they sit in a classroom and they can get pretty bored and then they can act out and then they can get labeled in various ways totally so it's why the again the industrial education system is slowly adapting and in good ways is to avoid that outcome and then charter schools are U.S.
551
form of school governance where a public school is a nonprofit and they get to be independent and operate under their own rules but they operate as a nonprofit focused on the kids and they're a little more flexible than the government run schools because they don't have the civil service orientation and there's quite a range of them.
552
There's no one learning style for charter schools.
553
So it's more a governance change, again, where they're run by a nonprofit.
554
Why is education so important to you?
555, it's important to everybody,, so I don't think that's a good idea.
556
Yeah, but not everybody dedicates their time to it.
557
Sure, I could be working on environment or aquaculture, lots of things.
558
Right out of university, I became a math teacher.
559
I was a Peace Corps math teacher in Swaziland, which is between South Africa and Mozambique, and spent two and a half years teaching.
560
And so later in life, when I became a philanthropist, it was the thing I knew a little bit about.
561
So I would have to say it's a bit random in that way.
562
But then,, what I counsel people is all the problems that we have in society today are the ones our parents and grandparents couldn't solve.
563
They're selected to be quite challenging.
564
So if you dig yourself into one major societal problem and spend your life on that, that's a great outcome,, to try to make a difference on one of these hard problems.
565
And why charter schools?
566
Why not tackle it through the Department of Education or a different way?
567
Why did you pick that vector?
568
Well, I came to believe that the government running the schools was the essence of the problem and that it would be better and more effective to have nonprofits.
569 if you look at the university sector,, and all of our top universities, they're all nonprofits.
570
And so it's modeling on that.
571
So it's a shift from more government bureaucratic control to nonprofit control.
572
One thing I think we both agree on is equality of opportunity.
573
And it's not always that way in the education system.
574
Your zip code or your postal code or wherever you live can dictate the quality of education you get.
575
How do we go about increasing equality of opportunity?
576
Well, I think tech is probably the biggest driver of that,, which is if we can have AI tutors that are in Khan Academy's case-free or low-cost in other cases,, on tablets that are widely available.
577
I think that's an incredibly great way to expand the franchise of learning.
578
If you were to take over education in charge of the country almost from a specific vector, what policies would you change?
579
What would you change in the classroom?
580
What would you include?
581
What would you take away?
582
Mostly I'd focus on school choice and giving teachers the tools to create a school because you get that flourishing of,, there's lots of teachers who have very good ideas about what would be the perfect public school, at least for some sector of kids, but they have no way to do that in the current system.
583
So it's then allowing them, supporting them to create a nonprofit, to create a school, and then to give the parents the choice to join that school or not.
584
So the whole model of teachers getting to create lots of new schools and then parents choosing which of those schools they want to go to is something I think would be transformative in a positive way for kids' outcomes.
585
What do you think goes into the decisions to transfer?
586
I'm thinking as a parent, what would cause me to transfer charter schools?
587
Maybe it offers the hope of better education and better teachers, and maybe it also deviates to the negative.
588
Not all of them are going to be successful.
589
So there's a risk involved in that.
590
How do you think about that from the parents' perspective?
591
Yeah,, it's a little,, for parents who send their kids to university, they have the same thing.
592
Some universities seem good, but aren't really, or it can be a good university and you have a bad experience.
593
So, there's no perfect outcome in that.
594
And then, in general, for charter schools, in wealthy areas where the schools are pretty good, the existing government schools, there's not much incentive to change.
595
And basically, so for example, in Palo Alto, California, there's no charter schools.
596
But in East Palo Alto, which is quite poor, right next door, there's a bunch of charter schools because the parents are desperate for change and options.
597
So, the charters have really focused on the lowest income kids because they don't have great government schools and they're willing to take a chance and try the new charter school.
598
And some of them have those charter schools have worked out fantastically.
599
That's awesome.
600
If you could shadow one CEO for a month, who would it be?
601
In the old days, for me, it was Jeff Bezos,, but now he's retired.
602
So,, it probably would be Jamie Dimon at this point since he's still active and such a broad intellectual.
603
And it'd be fascinating to,, be on his shoulder for a week.
604
I think he's one of the he's well known, but also underappreciated for all the things he's done and all the crises he's managed through in banking.
605
And he's becoming a lot more vocal too, which I think is a good thing.
606
Whether you agree with his vocalness or not, I do love the fact that CEOs are becoming more vocal about things that they're passionate and they feel they can share their opinions now yeah what's the biggest misconception that you think other people have about you I really don't know that they have any misconception or I'm not confident of what their perception is.
607
I would say for now, I'm focusing on turning around this cool ski area as a passion project and making it,, this fantastic and unique place, continuing the charter school work that helps get kids more opportunity.
608
So I would say if people have opportunity, it's that I'm trying to do things that are a balance of fun and good.
609
And,, powder is 90% fun and 10% good,, and the charter school work is 30% fun and 70% good.
610
So it's a range of different projects that way.
611
You said one of the philanthropists you admire is Bill Gates?
612
For sure.
613
Why is that?
614
His basic approach is a technocratic approach to human welfare, to sit down and try to think: okay, what are the causes of human misery and how do I knock them down one by one?
615
And takes bold, ambitious bets,, curing disease, many other things, energy.
616
So very long-term oriented.
617
He'll work on, give you an example, there's a terrible virus that affects cassava in Africa.
618
And cassava is potato, but it's the main crop, main calorie crop of many countries and people.
619
And this virus is continuing to spread, maybe naturally, maybe through climate change.
620
And he's been working for more than a decade to find genetically modified variants that don't suffer from this virus.
621
And they're now in field trials.
622
Okay.
623
And I was at one of the field trials recently, and it's stunning.
624,, basically the plants with this genetic modification don't get the virus.
625
And instead of getting a 10 or 20% yield that a farmer gets, because the virus has taken 80 or 90%, they get,, a 95% yield.
626
So it's five or ten times more food produced.
627
Okay.
628
But the foresight that Bill's team had to have to figure out what to back,, early is amazing.
629
So that deep science for, again, improved human welfare is very inspiring.
630
When you were running Netflix and Pure Software, how did you think about, I don't want to use the word balance, but it's probably the one most people understand between running a business, being ambitious, being all in on that, also family, friends, health, all these other competing things for your time and attention.
631
Yeah, I think of it as work-life integration.
632
When you have a bad example of work-life integration is pulling up your phone in the middle of dinner with your family.
633
Okay.
634
And a good example is,, you might come home at 5:30 and cook dinner and hang out with your kids.
635
And then at 8,, maybe they're watching TV and you go do an hour or two of work.
636
So the flexibility of what modern technology offers provides you an opportunity to do great integration.
637
Another would be,, while you're running, listening to a podcast.
638
Okay, so there's a a bunch of clever life hacks to improve integration because we most of us want a great family life and a great professional life.
639
And when you're into the balance metaphor, it's more of one, less of another.
640
It's zero sum in the metaphor.
641
And I think that's unsatisfying.
642, there's a degree of truth to it, but it's unsatisfying.
643
And so it's better to think of it as how do you improve work-life integration where you have, again, a great professional life and a strong family life.
644
The ones that get,, pushed to the side are,, how much friendships do you develop between, again, depending on your family situation, between family and work, that could be pretty all-consuming.
645
So that tends to get less.
646
And sometimes,, health and diet and exercise do.
647
But of course, as everyone knows, if you put some time into that, you'll be better at the other things.
648
Are there things that you gave up that you regret in the pursuit of your goals?
649
I was talking to Brian Halligan about this on the podcast.
650
And he said, look, I was focused on HubSpot.
651
That was my baby that got all,, 90% of my attention.
652
And I was, well, that's interesting.
653
Right now, looking back, do you regret it?
654
And he's, not at all.
655
I don't regret that at all.
656
If anything, I probably spent too much time,, with friends and family, and I should have spent more time in the business.
657, how do you think looking back now about how you've integrated all of these different things?
658
And if anything, you would change?
659
Yeah,, I don't have any big regrets.
660
I'm glad that I retired at 62.
661
And I think, oh, should I should have done it at 55 and had,, more of life in this new multifaceted state versus the obsessive state.
662
But it was, I loved my 25 years on Netflix.
663
It was fantastic.
664
And I'm so happy now that Greg and Ted are doing such a good job on it and enjoying it.
665
So it's all coming together.
666
So I can't think of any significant lessons or regret.
667
You do have to feel your way along.
668
And there are a few people who work Warren Buffett.
669
He does one thing until he's 95, but I'm not really critical of that.
670
It's not what I would want for my life.
671
But it's up to him how he wanted to live his life.
672
You mentioned the word obsessive.
673
Go deeper on that.
674
Well, I think to be world-class at anything, whether that's sports, cooking, business, you have to be pretty maniacal and obsessive and intense.
675
And,, it's not easy.
676
So I don't want to kid anyone that it's an easy life.
677
You have to definitely,, push hard and give a tremendous amount of energy,, as I did to Netflix, which is part of why it's great at 62 to hand it over to some,, people who are a decade younger and they're super obsessive now.
678
I want to come back to culture for a sec.
679
There's one question I didn't ask.
680
What was the keeper test and how did it apply?
681
So the keeper test is the Netflix shorthand for asking yourself: if one of your employees were quitting, how hard would you work to keep them to stay?
682
Would you try to change their mind?
683
And if you wouldn't, then you should proactively give them a generous severance package and try to recruit someone who you would feel that you would really try to keep them.
684
And so the typical employee test that people use is: did they screw up enough that they deserve firing?
685
So they have to really fail to deserve firing.
686
And we want to change that presumption to be: no, it's the people that you would fight to keep.
687
Those are the ones that you stay.
688
And if someone is not in that, then you should give them a package and move on.
689
And of course,, the more nuanced one is to have a conversation with them.
690, I wouldn't fight that hard.
691
And,, let's try to change that and,, try to not surprise them and be honest with them.
692
But it's shifting at the standard industrial model is you nearly have to commit a crime to get fired.
693
Okay.
694
As opposed to the athletic team case, which is, I think I can upgrade.
695
I wouldn't fight to keep you because you're fighting for a roster spot.
696
Because I want to win the championship.
697
At Pure, you IPO'd, I think you went through five head of sales in five years.
698
What was that, and what did you learn from that experience?
699
Sure.
700
Pure software was 91 to 97.
701
And we went public in 1995, strangely, the week before Netscape.
702
So, for one week, we were the hot tech IPO.
703
But it was challenging.
704, I didn't really understand how to run enterprise sales.
705
And so, I kept picking the wrong person that held us back for sure.
706
We could have grown faster, better, and be a more successful company if I had more of an adept hand at enterprise sales.
707
So, we had incredible products because we doubled our sales every year, despite the fact of turning over the sales team every year.
708
So, but again, if we had done, if I had done a better job of sales, we could have been even much more successful.
709
So, I don't know, take Atlassian in the modern era here that's been a phenomenal software tools company.
710
How did you had the wrong head of sales when you're doubling sales every year?
711, that seems a pretty good outcome, but you're, it's not fast enough, not enough velocity, or just the wrong fit.
712
Yeah,, each case was a little bit unique.
713
But, and,, it's possible that I made the wrong calls and I should have just kept the first one the whole time.
714
So,, again, but it was my bad decisions,, either on the hiring or the firing in this one area, sales, whereas in this other area, developing the product, we were very shorthanded and we had,, the hottest products of that time.
715
Was there a moment at Pure Software where you wanted to give up, or you found yourself feeling sorry for yourself, or what was that, and how did you get out of it?
716
Yeah, I don't think I felt sorry for myself, but I did feel I was hurting the company back to these sales turnovers and back to caring more about the company than myself.
717
So, I wanted the company to succeed more than I cared about myself.
718
And so, I, twice, I went to the board and said, Look, you should hire,, a CEO who's got a shorthand in sales, and I'll do product and it's fine.
719
And,, and both times they rejected that idea.
720
And it's, yeah, you are making mistakes.
721
They were clear about that.
722
But overall, we'd rather be investors in this company that you're doing than make that change.
723
And for me, it was a little bit, it's confession,, because I felt so guilty about those sales mistakes.
724
That then,, offering my role and sacrifice, it was cleanse that wound and then get up and live to fight another day.
725
Do you think that there's a difference for the role of the board on a founder-led company versus maybe a professional manager or non-large founder, I guess, involved in the company?
726, there's a lot of talk about that, founder-led companies and not.
727
And I'm not sure that I buy into that very much.
728
There are some very bad founder-led companies.
729
There's some very good professional-led companies.
730
And there might be some correlation that founder-led ones,, are extraordinary.
731
But,, Microsoft under such an Adelaide has done incredibly well.
732
The most value out of any company ever, right?
733
Sundar, Pishai.
734,, it's, I'm not sure that it's such a strict correlation.
735
So I'm thrilled that Mark Zuckerberg's doing so well.
736
But again,, there's lots of other companies that have other managers or leaders, and everyone's going to eventually do well.
737
So, do you think the role of the board is different when there's a founder as the CEO versus a non-founder CEO?
738, I did a little venture capital in the mid-90s after Pure, and I sucked at it.
739
And so, I would say I would defer to my venture capital colleagues who would comment to you professionally and thoughtfully.
740
I only know my one or two little board experiences, and I would say I'm not that deep in this area.
741
Who's the best venture capitalist from an investing point of view and identifying talent?
742, I'm not that broad in the area, so I don't have a comprehensive view, but Ben Horowitz has always seemed to me just phenomenal.
743
And he's never been on one of my boards, but just from watching and talking with him.
744
Is there a moment that stands out as a defining moment in your life?
745
No, I don't remember any Damascus Road experience where I suddenly change.
746, I would say I've always been open to new experience and trying new things.
747
And I'm quite surprised that then I succeeded at business.
748
I never really thought that much about business.
749
And so I was content to try many things.
750
And I did a company, Pure Software, only because I got excited about a certain product and I needed to accompany to get that product out.
751
So I was always led by my passions, and it's,, worked out super well.
752
The first product you got excited about was a foot mouse, was it not?
753
Well, that's true.
754, let's see, if we go way back in middle school, I was,, selling cinnamon sticks and things that.
755
But when I was a grad student at Stanford in the mid-80s, I thought that the big idea was to have a mouse that was controlled by your foot so you keep your hands on the keyboard and you could type and point at the same time.
756
And I almost dropped out of school to do it.
757
I got so excited about it and, did a bunch of research on the original mouse and how it came to be and this thing.
758
But once we started using the prototypes, two problems really became glaring.
759
One is it's very dirty on the floor.
760
So after three, four days, it was very gross cleaning it out.
761
And then two, your leg cramped and it just did not have the fine muscle control that your hands have.
762
And so if you tried to do any fine movement with a mouse, it was a big problem.
763
And so luckily, I did not go forward with that idea.
764
I want to wrap up.
765
We always ask the same question.
766
What is success for you?
767
I would say success is having a positive impact on other people.
768
And that could be,, through religion, that could be through a nonprofit, that could be through government service, that could be through business.
769
But,, doing good for others would be my fundamental core definition of success.
