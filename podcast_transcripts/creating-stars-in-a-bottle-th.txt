1
Fusion's a reaction, and it's the reaction that's the most prominent reaction in the universe.
2
So, fusion is the power inside the stars.
3
It's the reaction that basically can never run out of fuel.
4
You'd have what is functionally limitless, clean energy.
5
Entrepreneurs make these things happen.
6
Without entrepreneurs like Bob, this would go on forever, and we'd never be quite there.
7
The technology has always been 30 years away.
8
And now, you know, instead of 30 years, we talk in terms of, you know, is it 30 months?
9
Which is super exciting to see.
10
Hey, I'm Mario, and this is the Generalist Podcast.
11
You've probably heard the saying, the future is already here.
12
It's just not evenly distributed yet.
13
On this podcast, I sit down with the visionaries, builders, and investors who are already living in that future to give you a clear window into what's coming next.
14
Today, I'm speaking with Bob Mungard and Vinod Khosla about what might be the most transformative energy technology of our lifetime, nuclear fusion, also known as Fusion Energy.
15
Bob is the CEO and co-founder of Commonwealth Fusion Systems, CFS, the world's leading fusion energy company.
16
Under his leadership, CFS has grown to 800 employees and raised more than $2 billion from climate-focused investors.
17
Bob holds a PhD in applied plasma physics from NIT and has dedicated his career to bringing fusion from lab to market.
18
Vinod Khosla needs little introduction.
19
He's one of the most visionary venture capitalists of our time, the founder of Sun Microsystems and Coastla Ventures, and the backer of transformative companies like OpenAI, DoorDash, Stripe, and of course, Commonwealth Fusion Systems.
20
In my conversation with Bob and Vinod, we discuss the wild, poetic science behind fusion energy, how CFS has accelerated the timeline for commercial fusion from being perennially 30 years out to potentially just a few years away, and what a world with abundant fusion energy might enable from super intelligent AI to brand new industries that we haven't even imagined yet.
21
I can't tell you how much I learned from this conversation and how excited it got me about Fusion's potential.
22
My hope is that you'll walk away with meaningful lessons about how energy innovation happens, why this technology matters in an AI-powered future, and how fusion might be the key that unlocks solutions to some of our most pressing challenges.

Bob and Vinod, it is so great to have you here today.
40
I am thrilled to talk about Fusion Energy, Commonwealth Fusion Systems, and why this has been the holy grail of energy for quite so long.
41
A lot of people may have heard of nuclear energy and thought about what its impact might be for the future, but may not understand the real basics of what we're talking about here.
42
So, to begin, I was hoping to just have you, Bob, tell us a little bit about what fusion energy is and why it's so important, because especially as we think about AI and climate change, it feels like something that anyone who wants to look towards the future has to have at least a sort of rudimentary understanding of.
43
Yeah, it's an area that a lot of people see maybe in a science textbook and then sort of put in the back of their mind or comic book or something like that.
44
And really, though, what fusion is, is fusion is a reaction, and it's the reaction, it's the most prominent reaction in the universe.
45
So, fusion is the power inside the stars.
46
It's the reaction that builds up all the atoms.
47
And what that does is it takes the lightest elements and combines them together, and in the process, the result is a little bit less mass than within.
48
In fact, it's the opposite process of nuclear fission, which is what people today know as nuclear power, in which nuclear power powers a large part of the world's energy needs.
49
But in fusion, it's the other end of the Pirag table, building atoms up.
50
And so the sort of reason you'd want to do this is because it's a reaction that basically could never run out of fuel.
51
So the stars don't really run out of fuel.
52
It takes them several billion years to do that.
53
So if you made that work on Earth, you'd have a completely new type of energy source.
54
You'd have what is functionally limitless, clean energy.
55
And the other thing that I thought was interesting in learning a little bit about this, and it's something I've been really excited to try and educate myself on, is just how different fusion and fission are, such that fission can unfortunately have incidences where it goes very wrong.
56
And one of the things that I was learning about fusion is that, like, I don't know if fragile is quite the right word, but it is something that you have to pay very, very close attention to, such that a puff of air in the wrong place can stop it from operating in the right way.
57
You can probably explain that much better than I could.
58
You've got the gist of it.
59
So in traditional nuclear fission, it's a chain reaction.
60
So you put in a large amount of uranium or plutonium, which are things that you can use to make a chain reaction for nefarious purposes.
61
Then you sort of burn it very slowly over time.
62
And the challenge is controlling that, which we can do.
63
Then also, when you want to shut it off, it doesn't necessarily shut off on your time scale.
64
It actually keeps going.
65
And that's how you get a meltdown.
66
And it's also why you have waste that lasts thousands of years.
67
That doesn't mean it's not safe.
68
It just means you have to design that in, and you have to accept that in your society.
69
With fusion, the challenge is that it's the most prevalent elements, so it's not a fuel challenge.
70
There's no chain reaction.
71
Instead, it's how do you create the right conditions?
72
It's sort of like brewing the right beer.
73
If you don't get the right conditions, your beer is not going to work right.
74
If you do, you can be magical, right?
75
Well, fusion, those conditions are really extreme.
76
They never occur on Earth.
77
You have to go to big lengths to make them occur.
78
You have to build machines to make them occur.
79
It also means that if something's not quite right, it will stop.
80
And as you mentioned, you can actually blow out a fusion machine with a single breath of air.
81
But actually, a breath of air has more particles in it than all the fuel that at any given time is inside a fusion machine.
82
We're going to talk more about some of the, well, to my mind, poetic parts of this machine, including how a breath of air can stop it from working.
83
But Vinod, you're someone who has reliably seen the future before the rest of the world has.
84
You've done that throughout your career from the very early days at Sun through to the present moment.
85
You're also very well known for being one of the first outside investors in OpenAI's for-profit arm.
86
But what is less well known is that the same year that you made that investment in OpenAI, you also invested in Commonwealth Fusion System, CFS.
87
There's now a very clear connection between those two technologies.
88
I'm curious if you could explain a little bit about that.
89
I think both are really, really important.
90
Artificial intelligence is really important.
91
And energy is really, really important.
92
I didn't quite connect how much energy AI would use.
93
I didn't have that foresight.
94
But we are fortunate we are here and we have a source of power to power that AI.
95
Given the energy intensity of AI that we've seen over the past few years, how has it changed how you think about Bob's work and CFS?
96
Does this just become even more obvious why this is so critical?
97
Are there other parts that have sort of come to light for you?
98
I would say we absolutely need AI and we absolutely need fusion and independent of each other.
99
I didn't connect the two in 2018 when I invested in both, to be honest.
100
I did think limitless energy was going to open up a lot of possibilities.
101
And that was the important thing.
102
And we needed clean, limitless energy because of climate change, but also because cheap limitless energy can do a lot of things for humanity.
103
There's a saying in the fusion space, from what I understand, Bob, that the technology has always been 30 years away.
104
And I'm curious how you, as a kid and as a young adult, and eventually as an adult, decided to spend your life in a field that had that dimension to it, where it always felt just out of reach.
105
Were you the kid?
106
Were you dreaming about this from a young age?
107
So actually, I was that.
108
There are people that are bona fide fusion aficionados that start really, really young, like third grade.
109
I was not that.
110
What I am is a history of technology person and studied how technologies go from laboratory to impact.
111
And almost all those technologies have some element.
112
It's like, oh, it's always a long way away and it always will be.
113
And that's true if you're a lay person.
114
But if you actually study the history and you look, you can see these things advancing.
115
You can see them advancing and them speeding up, whether that's what large language models have recently done in AI, or whether that's biotech, or whether that's the railroad, that's the same pattern.
116
And Fusion, about 10 years ago, started to go through that pattern, that beginning of that pattern.
117
I was in the field for reasons related to energy, and all of a sudden, fusion became more and more relevant as it got faster and faster.
118
And really, the last five years, it's drastically picked up.
119
And now, instead of 30 years, we talk in terms of, is it 30 months, that sort of type of discussion, which is super exciting to see.
120
So if you hadn't seen sort of these dimensions changing in Fusion, maybe you would be doing some other part of the energy stack, it sounds like.
121
Is that right?
122
That's right, yeah.
123
Go where the smartest people are going, where the technologies are all overlapping, where the science is firm, and Fusion, if it's that bill.
124
Is there, as you look sort of back on the history of fusion, a specific person from the field that you're like, you know, this person should be better known for their contributions but has perhaps been forgotten or isn't as widely known as they should be?
125
Oh, I don't know if I'm in the position to be able to identify that.
126
But I do think that the impact on the world that fusion will have long term, like when we look back at it, you know, there will be more household names that are right now sort of esoteric inside baseball.
127
Amazing.
128
The note, you are someone who tends to take ideas from scientific research papers.
129
I know that your first company, which was an alternative milk business that you were trying to get off the ground in India, came from studying sort of the up-to-date research on that technology.
130
Had you read a lot about nuclear fusion before meeting Bob in 2018, 2019?
131
Well, I vividly remember meeting Bob and standing on top of the fusion reactor where they were doing these shots and saying, boy, this has to exist.
132
And Bob had a plan.
133
But my view is, just to add to Bob's question, entrepreneurs make these things happen.
134
Very much true, it happened in electric cars.
135
The Department of Energy had a forecast for the number of electric cars in 2035 that I think Tesla exceeded in 2015 or 2016.
136
While everybody else was sticking to traditional wisdom, Bob just, Elon Musk.
137
On its own base, without entrepreneurs like Bob, this would go on forever.
138
And we'd never be quite there.
139
But Bob took it on and we had backup plans.
140
I remember us making a plan.
141
If we got a 20 Tesla magnet and didn't get to Fusion, what would we do?
142
We actually went through that discussion and made plans, the backup plans, if we spent all this money and we didn't get to it.
143
So it takes an entrepreneur to do this, and that's why I was really excited to support Bob in doing this.
144
You talked there, Vinod, about the sort of 20 Tesla magnet, which is a big part of Commonwealth Fusion's systems history.
145
At the time that you guys had met, there were these changes in material science that were sort of potentially setting the groundwork for that magnet.
146
Bob, maybe you can tell us a little bit about what had changed that had made you excited to jump in the industry and what the state of play was when you met Vinod in 2018.
147
Yeah, so I'd been in Fusion for almost 10 years when I met Vinod and had watched as a confluence of different technologies and science results started to pile up.
148
You had the ability to predict how these fusion plasmas, which are very complex, they're still things we don't entirely understand, you could predict them.
149
So machine learning, large-scale simulation, big compute was making inroads.
150
And we were really, you know, for the first time seeing compute simulation make an impact on our understanding of those plasmas, those very hot plasmas.
151
That was one area.
152
You could also see other technologies that hadn't been applied to fusion before that were developed for fast chargers and for some materials, etc.
153
But in the fusion that I was working in, and that CFS still works in, is a leader in, the predominant way to harness fusion is to use magnetic fields to build a magnetic bottle.
154
So you basically take a tiny, tiny bit of fuel and you get it really hot and you keep it hot using a series of magnets.
155
And it turns out the performance of those fusion machines goes like the magnetic field to like the fourth power, super non-linear.
156
And anytime you see something that is like very non-linear, think like Moore's Law, that's very non-linear, right?
157
Like that says go and crank it.
158
And we'd cranked the magnets as far as they were ever going to go.
159
And then there was a new material, a material science breakthrough, that opened the path to even higher field magnets, to double the magnetic field.
160
And so by about 2016, we really understood that that was going to be the thing that pushed fusion over the top.
161
But you needed to go and take this new material and develop an entire technical stack on it of a new type of magnet.
162
And so in 2018, we set out to do that.
163
There were people that said that was going to take 30 years.
164
We said we think it'll take three.
165
We did it in just over three.
166
And that was a big magnet in 2021 that showed that you could reach these very high magnetic fields, 20 tests, like 90 that lives in aircraft carrier level.
167
And because of that higher magnetic field, you said, you know, the magnetic field is important to sort of create the heat necessary.
168
Is it fair?
169
You know, am I correct in saying that more powerful magnets?
170
The way to think about fusion is you've got to get to these extreme conditions that are very hot.
171
So, like 100 million degrees.
172
We're talking like hotter than the center of the sun.
173
So, when Bruno was talking about standing on top of a machine at MIT, that machine actually could get to those temperatures.
174
It was at the time the hottest thing in the solar system.
175
Yeah, I heard you say that on a different speech, and I literally chuckled out loud and turned to my, and my wife was like, Well, what are you laughing about?
176
I was like, I just heard the craziest thing.
177
You know, that's part of the poetry of these machines.
178
Anyway, sorry, very, very hot.
179
But it's not enough to just make it hot.
180
Like, you know, if you like, you know, have a big furnace in your house, you can make your furnace hot or make your house hot.
181
But if you have all the doors and windows open, it won't stay hot.
182
And so, you need to also insulate it very well.
183
And so, that way, when you put the heat in it, it stays hot.
184
Otherwise, you'll never make more power than it takes to heat it up.
185
And so, getting that insulation, that's what the magnetic field does.
186
It bottles up and it makes the fuel very well insulated.
187
If you think about like your coffee thermos, you know, your coffee thermos keeps your coffee warm most of the day, all day, if you've got a good one.
188
Um, if that could insulate things as well as the fusion power plant insulates it, you know, it would still be warm like years later.
189
That's what we're talking about, like, really, really insulating it.
190
And with these magnets, you could see that you could increase the effectiveness by an order of magnitude.
191
Which, anytime you see anything that you get a factor of 10, like, you know, you got to go try it.
192
Do you ever think, Bob, that?
193
It's a complicated way to keep a coffee hot, but I wouldn't want to drink 100 million-degree coffee either.
194
Yes, that's fair enough.
195
Vinode, you mentioned that this progress really happens because of exceptional people who refuse to accept what the status quo is, refuse to accept the projections made by top-down governmental bodies.
196
What was it about Bob when you met him and the team that he was pulling together that made you think, like, you know, this is someone who can break these norms and push us forward on a much faster timeline?
197
I'd say a couple of things.
198
First, this approach to energy was too important to not try.
199
And I have a set of things I think we should try.
200
And I'd rather say try and fail, but don't fail to try.
201
And I think when we started, we didn't know for sure what would get in the way.
202
We had alternative plans for a 20-Tesla magnet.
203
We made those plans and found off-ramps, but we're hoping never to use them.
204
So it was just a great team attempting a large project.
205
Look, without taking risk, you're not going to do something exceptional.
206
Most people are afraid to risk.
207
They fail to try instead of trying and failing.
208
And I think that was the key here.
209
Bob was willing to give it a try.
210
He had a very solid scientific thesis behind it.
211
So it wasn't just try.
212
Bob had a great team, so it was all worth giving it a try.
213
From my point of view, it was too important to not try.
214
Do you remember what some of those alternatives were that you had laid out?
215
Had the magnet not worked as you'd hoped?
216
Yeah, there were alternatives, and Bob can talk about it more than I can, but there were off-ramps we could use.
217
Very high-test on magnets for windmills, for nuclear medicine, MRI machines, potentially.
218
Bob, go ahead and talk about it.
219
Yeah, yeah.
220
There was a bunch.
221
And like, you know, even something like the Caterpillar Drive from Hunter October, right?
222
Like, high-field magnets can be used for lots of applications.
223
But I think the important part was: how do you manage the risk of a big endeavor at the intersection of science and technology?
224
That you don't just take no risk, but you don't take risks that you're going to learn something that someone already knew.
225
You need to find the novel ways you were going to fail and try to identify those in advance, sort of pre-mortem of what that's going to look like.
226
And then manage the risk, retire the risk, put the biggest risks earliest, and go build the experiments that are going to teach you about that fast.
227
And so, while we built the 20 Tesla magnet, and it was an important day that we turned it on, it works, and now we build them like every day.
228
Up until that point, we built a lot of stuff that we really pushed the limits and broke.
229
And you can't be afraid of that because that's how you actually.
230
That's very determinate.
231
So that was the strategy that we brought to that.
232
And that was different than what we'd done under government funding, for instance, where you couldn't really do that.
233
Entrepreneurs do this all the time, but typically not in such hardware-intensive physical sciences.
234
So that was novel.
235
And luckily, we had the node, and we could actually push forward in that strategy.
236
I remember watching with excitement over hours and hours as the needy crept up to 20 Tesla.
237
This was in watching the sort of the debut of the magnet?
238
Yes.
239
Amazing.
240
As we live streams for the first time we turned it on, which shows you our risk tolerance.
241
Yes, that could have been a tough moment otherwise.

253
We've talked a little bit already about some of the sort of just mind-bending parts of this technology, you know, the hottest thing in the solar system, you know, the way that it interacts with a puff of air.
254
You've said before, Bob, that, you know, it's not like a star in a bottle.
255
It is a star in a bottle.
256
And, you know, it really made me wonder how going through this process has potentially changed your concept of time.
257
Because usually stars are formed over, you know, maybe tens of millions of years, and you are creating a machine to manifest them.
258
You know, I don't know how instantaneous it is, but much faster than that.
259
And so, yeah, just curious how you think about that.
260
I'm a scientist, so one of the great things about science is that the rules are the same everywhere, right?
261
And so how you get to that point might be different, but the way that physics works is the way it works all places, all times.
262
And so, you know, for a star, in order to make that reaction happen and get those temperatures, it uses the physical force of gravity.
263
Well, it takes moving a lot of material.
264
You can't do that on Earth.
265
That's not going to work.
266
But you have, because people are clever and science is advanced, you know that you can use magnetic fields, or you can use electric fields, or you can use the speed to your advantage.
267
Those are all different ways that people do fusion.
268
And even though it's the same physics that's happening inside those machines, you get there at a different pace.
269
And in fact, we had a machine in MIT that could recreate plasma that's like the plasma that is the Aurora Borealis.
270
And you could study it in the laboratory instead of with a telescope.
271
That's the beauty of science.
272
But then it's a different step to take that and actually say, okay, we understand it, we can predict it, to actually then harness it to make a product.
273
And that's where entrepreneurship really starts: is, you know, there's no set hard-fast rules about how markets work at the level there is about how electric fields work.
274
So you have to be able to bridge that.
275
And it's been fun to watch and shepherd fusion along that journey.
276
One of the things that struck me about watching some of your previous talks and reading about CFS is how obvious it seemed that you were thinking about scale from day one.
277
Like it wasn't enough to simply make this technology work.
278
It's important to find a way to roll it out really widely, really quickly, because of this dynamic that you call competing with a molecule.
279
And so, yeah, I would love to hear what that means to you and what the plan is to sort of make that.
280
You know, most people, you know, they don't understand energy beyond they flip a switch or they fill up their gas tank, right?
281
They don't understand the scale of it.
282
When you sit down and you look at the numbers, clear-eyed, you know, you realize that energy is one of the largest things that humans do, right?
283
One out of every $12 or so goes to energy.
284
You know, you've got tens of millions of people working in energy.
285
That just power plants, electrical power plants, that's tens of thousands of power plants that exist today.
286
The first power plant was at the turn of the century.
287
We built that entire system up.
288
It's one of the most amazing things that humans have done is to continually get better and better at energy, whether that was using domestic animals, crops before that, later, you know, hydropower and mills to electricity and nuclear power, fossil fuels, and what they enable for the world.
289
And so we've gone on this journey.
290
It's the biggest thread that humans have done, really.
291
And to think that we're not done, just because we have what we have today doesn't mean it's the end.
292
It doesn't mean that it's like there's nothing better.
293
The idea that digging up and burning molecules out of the ground is like the end-all-be-all.
294
No, no, that cannot be.
295
That can be the lowest cost way to do it.
296
We have all these other technologies, there's all these other physical processes.
297
The universe has already picked its solution, fusion.
298
Let's go grab that and put it on Earth, put it within our grasp.
299
The same way, you know, we domesticated animals.
300
It's the same pattern over again, but now with all the technologies behind it.
301
But essential that we do it at a meaningful speed, given where we are with our climate.
302
And I love what you said: the universe has picked its solution.
303
And so that's obviously a big part of the drive here, too.
304
Yo, absolutely.
305
And one of the cool things about fusion is about that speed.
306
That if you think about all the other energy sources that we're used to today, almost all of them, they're all really kind of hunter-gatherer mode, right?
307
Like we're going out and we're doing discovery of deposits and we're mining them.
308
We're capturing those resources.
309
We're moving it around.
310
We're trucking it.
311
We're putting it on ships, right?
312
And we're burning it, throwing it into something and burning it.
313
And that is a very consumptive means.
314
And that means in order to scale it, you just have to consume more.
315
You have to find more.
316
You have to move more.
317
It's quite a lot of work to do all that.
318
And with fusion, you get a machine that you don't have consumption, the fuels around there.
319
If you know how to build the machine, you get energy.
320
That's energy as a technology.
321
That means it could scale really fast.
322
The world can learn how to build machines pretty fast.
323
That's much easier to get faster at than, say, discovery of deposits or capturing large distributed things.
324
And so the hope here is that with fusion energy, if it's designed with that in mind from the beginning, you could get into a cycle that looks more like the technologies that we use today and we're accustomed to.
325
Our computers, our cars, our phones, things that were truly, once you knew it worked, you could learn how to build a lot of them.
326
And that would be really good.
327
Yeah, the world looks very different when that is not a fuel-intensive process and a resource-intensive process and is just sort of wildly available and unlocks so many new things.
328
Before we sort of dig into that a little bit deeper, the way that Commonwealth CFS actually sort of plans to roll this out, I thought was such a clever strategy, Vinod.
329
I wonder, you've been a part of some incredible startup stories over the years.
330
You've seen some of the best entrepreneurial strategists roll out extremely ambitious ideas, but this idea of sort of partnering with existing power plant operators to make CFS work and sort of make this transition into a fusion world, I thought was really fascinating.
331
I'd be curious how you thought, how you have thought about it over the years.
332
I would give you the general principle.
333
In fusion, lots of people have done lots of good work for many, many decades.
334
But it takes an entrepreneur to just make it happen.
335
Turn a 30-year IDAR timeline to three years and imagine the impossible.
336
So it's more like what Bob did here was imagine the possible and then try and make it happen and not be afraid of failing if you did fail at it.
337
I think that's what Fusion was missing.
338
That's what Bob did.
339
And as a small clarification, IDER is a sort of initiative that's been taking place.
340
And Commonwealth Fusion Systems is obviously operating much faster.
341
But the question that I was interested to dig into is really how CFS sort of operates, in this joint structure where you sort of partner with the stakeholders of the old energy world, and rather than sort of doing away with them entirely, actually finds a way to sort of like bring those people along.
342
So this is what entrepreneurs do.
343
Imagine the possible, then try and make it happen.
344
And the second part of make it happen is how can you scale it very quickly.
345
If you're going to build 5,000 power plants in the U.S., it'll take a very long time doing it on your own.
346
Repowering existing plants would make it much faster and make the politics of it much easier.
347
All the incumbent power plant owners would want to be in this new world with less side effects and more benefits.
348
In the past, environmentalists have just generally fought these older technologies instead of saying, how do we upgrade them, make them better?
349
Nobody wants to take 5,000 power plants worth of assets and discard them.
350
And what Bob did here is find a way to upgrade them.
351
It's actually quite simple.
352
It aligns with financial motivations, also makes the technology roll out substantially faster than anybody imagined or even believes today.
353
But I do think this is the right.
354
Upgrade what people have so they don't have to write off their assets, change the economics, you know, and be losers.
355
They can be winners instead of being losers by adapting this technology.
356
So incentives get a lot.
357
Bob, can you tell us a little bit more about that specifically with what's actually happening in Virginia and the state of play on that front?
358
So with fusion, you're building a machine that's a plant.
359
It's not something you're going to put in your car, your basement.
360
A power plant.
361
Yeah, it's a power plant.
362
And the world luckily knows how to do that, has a bunch of them, and people operate them, and that's the backbone of the energy system.
363
And so in Virginia, we're working with the utility Dominion, which is the major utility in that region.
364
And we're taking an interconnect, a place where there was a coal plant.
365
And that coal plant's gone.
366
But the community is still there, knows energy.
367
The connection to the grid is still there.
368
Land is still there.
369
And so next to it, we're actually putting a fusion power plant.
370
We announced that in December.
371
And so that means that we don't need to run new transmission lines.
372
We don't need to find new places.
373
We can even use some of the expertise and assets.
374
And importantly, do that with people that their business is owning and operating power plants, which is what we need more and more of just to be clean.
375
And so that's the ARC project, and we're getting ready to get deeper and deeper in that project.
376
But importantly, that is a project that was based on Spark, which is the machine we're building now in Massachusetts.
377
That is very similar.
378
It just doesn't sell power to the grid, but it's designed to show how that works and be flexible enough to de-risk the remaining questions.
379
And that's at an old military site.
380
But again, same story: a community that knows how to build things.
381
And that you go out and you retire the risk early of, like, how do you convince people to have Fusion as a neighbor?
382
And so it's that same pattern over and over again.
383
What I love about it is it feels like such a clever, strategic jiu-jitsu move where all the people who might have been, have their vested interests to really oppose these new forms of energy because their livelihoods depend on it, the community depends on it, suddenly have a chance to really participate in it and be a part of this new era in a really exciting way.
384
You also mentioned Spark there.
385
Just again, to help folks wrap their head around how Spark fits into CFS exactly, what is the part that Spark plays?
386
How essential is it?
387
Yeah, so the roadmap for CFS has been the same from the beginning, from all the way, this is 2016, when we first met Vinod and started to refine it.
388
And the roadmap is pretty straightforward.
389
Take the science we already know, these machines called tokamaks, magnetic bottles, that are pretty close to the right conditions, that are not there yet.
390
Add to them a new technology, a magnet that is much higher magnetic field, that allows you to re-optimize them to be more commercially deliverable, so smaller, faster, something that a company can do as a product.
391
Demonstrate that you can actually do that by building one.
392
And so Spark is a demonstration machine that is most of the parts of the power plant at nearly the full scale, delivered in the same business model, vertically integrated with a set of suppliers.
393
That's aim is to show up at the plant, push a button, and make a star that makes more power out than in, 10 times more power out than in, at industrial scale, 100 megawatts.
394
No worries.
395
Yeah.
396
And they're all that same science that's in ether and machines that came in the past.
397
And that is what we're doing right now.
398
And we're deep into that.
399
You can see the end of that project, which is super, super exciting.
400
But it is the preeminent fusion facility in the world.
401
It's got national labs and universities and everyone super, super excited and part of it.
402
Then that is the template for the first power plants.
403
And so that's ARC, the first one will be in Virginia.
404
But if you look at it, it looks the same, except it's bigger, makes more power because it's bigger.
405
And it's simpler in some ways because it doesn't need to be as flexible.
406
And it really then works as a pair between Spark and Arc.
407
And all the existing science that's come before to really optimize that first generation power plant so that it can be a shot at commercial viability right out of the gate.
408
So push a button and get a star is another thing that's going to be now living in my head for, you know, that I'll be thinking about once a week for the next few years, I think.
409
But you mentioned earlier, Bob, that the process behind CFS was really, you know, think of the biggest risks, tackle them one by one, methodically.
410
Where things stand now, what are the biggest risks sort of?
411
With Spark, that is a machine that's not waiting on any RD or breakthrough.
412
The last major breakthrough for that was building this new class of magnets.
413
And that was by design.
414
Don't try to stack too much on top of it because if any one thing fails, then the whole thing fails.
415
So manage that risk.
416
So Spark at this stage, that's an execution project.
417
So the type of things that keep me and the other leaders and all the way down, I'm sure, in the organization up at night are pretty mundane stuff.
418
It is like, how do you build hardware?
419
Is the boat going to dock on time with the parts on it?
420
When you put the two skids together, will the pipes fit?
421
When you fire it all up, did the people that wired it get the cross-sector wires?
422
It's that type of work.
423
It's that work in a novel, first-of-a-kind context by a company that is built just for that purpose.
424
But that's the type of work it is.
425
So that is, in some ways, very, very helpful because it means that between us and Spark turning on and making more power than in, it's a lot of work, but it's not a lot of half-dependence of figuring out things that you really have unknown, unknowns.
426
We don't really see a lot of those.
427
So that's super exciting.
428
And that's been a feature of the plan from the very beginning.
429
And then once we have Spark, it will teach us some things that will be very important for the fusion industry.
430
It'll teach us, no one has made a plasma on Earth that really is at fusion conditions, spitting out hundreds of megawatts of power.
431
That's like breaking the sound barrier in some ways where you've gotten close, you've seen it, and you've done the simulations, and now you've got the machine to do it.
432
So now go do it.
433
And that's what Spark will do for us on the path to ARC.
434
You've talked before about sort of the six stages that different fusion energy companies should really be judged on and sort of the way that you should benchmark their progress.
435
I'd be curious to hear, you know, maybe a summary of those for folks so that they can have it in their minds as they see and read about other projects.
436
And where you think CFS is sort of at the moment.
437
Yeah, I'm going to start backwards.
438
Okay, so like the end result of all this is you build power plants that make economical power.
439
What does that mean?
440
A power plant that someone buys that makes five, six cents a kilowatt hour.
441
That's market beating around the whole world.
442
Okay, before you build that power plant, no one has done that.
443
ARC is, we'd like ARC to do that, but we don't know exactly what the economics will do.
444
So before you do that, you make a power plant that can sell any power.
445
So independent of price.
446
Just like put electrical power on the grid.
447
That's milestone number five.
448
No one has done that.
449
That's net electric.
450
And that's not just like you ran power through it.
451
No, it is like you draw a fence around it and it exports electricity, self-sustaining.
452
No one's done that.
453
That's ARC.
454
Before you do that, the hard part about fusion is getting that plasma to those conditions so that it will actually make a bunch of fusion power.
455
You know, if you don't make fusion power from the plasma, you're in no way you're going to make enough to make up for everything that you lose in the plant.
456
So that is, we call Q greater than one, long-time goal.
457
And that's just more energy out than in, basically, right?
458
That's you got a piece of plasma, maybe like a gram or less of plasma, and it's at fusion conditions at the right fuels, and it is actually making power.
459
And like, you got a power meter going in of that plasma, and you got a power meter coming out of that plasma, and the second is more than the first.
460
NIF did that in California two years ago, and it has since.
461
Spark will do that at a much bigger scale.
462
Those are the only two things under construction, that and Eater, that will do that.
463
But before you can really make a bunch of power from fusion, the plasma itself, you got to get it to the right conditions.
464
So, that's milestone number three.
465
There's some technical pieces around those conditions, but it's basically hot, dense, and insulated.
466
Before you can even do that, you got to get it hot.
467
That's milestone number two.
468
How hot is hot?
469
I mean, 10 million degrees is pretty hot.
470
Fusion is like 100 million, but like getting to 10 million, that's a big accomplishment.
471
Actually, lots of people have done that.
472
That's super exciting.
473
And before you do that, you have to be able to even make a plasma at all.
474
Meaning, you know, you actually have a flash of light inside the machine.
475
Fortunately, lots and lots of people have done that.
476
And so, where the cutting edge right now is Spark, NIF, but there's other stuff in the pipeline that people are working on, and that's one of the, I think, exciting parts: you can see these milestones: you know, plasma hot enough in the right fusion conditions, more power from the fusion reaction than to heat it, more electricity out, selling it, economic.
477
You can see people.
478
So, 2025, 2026, CFS maybe goes from like number three to five.
479
Does that feel about right?
480
2026, 27 will go, we're sitting here right now at number three, we'll go to number four.
481
And early 30s, go from four to five, and hopefully very quickly, five to six.
482
Amazing.
483
Vinod, as you think about the world, when you do get the push a button to make a star moment, what are sort of the second order, third-order effects that you think about?
484
You know, in a world where energy is really essentially too cheap to meter, what are the businesses that suddenly get unlocked?
485
Well, we've been surprised how much energy AI is taking, for one.
486
But there's so many other things that the price of energy declines that are possible.
487
Water is a big issue, but desalination is principally electricity.
488
That's another huge one.
489
Growing crops in the right conditions and indoors, maybe, and not destroying the environment with low-density crop production.
490
I could go on and on.
491
So much more is possible.
492
Currently, there'd be things we haven't imagined when energy is limitless and not gated by things with lots of side effects.
493
Coal has lots of side effects.
494
Natural gas has side effects.
495
The geopolitical implications of energy almost go west.
496
Interesting.
497
Do you think there's an emergence of new geopolitical?
498
And in many ways, it feels like this is a very strategic asset in the same way that AI is becoming a strategic asset.
499
How do you think about the U.S.
500
leading the way in this field?
501
Well, there will always be geopolitical aspects to any technology.
502
But fundamentally, if every society can have all its energy at very inexpensive prices, I think the world is a better place and there's less conflict.
503
We have a lot of conflict over resources.
504
Some of those, not all, will go away.
505
Okay, final question before I lead us into just the ending philosophical questions.
506
As you look at the fusion energy landscape, I'm curious how both of you or where both of you maybe see opportunities for other entrepreneurs to build things.
507
What are the sort of complements for CFS that need to exist or the different approaches that we want to see come to the fore?
508
Maybe, Bob, you can start us off with things that you hope new founders are going to chase after.
509
So fusion has some attributes that are nice in the sense that you can reuse existing industry.
510
We talked about the power plants.
511
We have fabricators that make our stuff that is oil and gas fabricators.
512
There's also a bunch of fusion widgets that all fusion plants will need.
513
There's simulation tools.
514
There's sort of the picks and shovels of a fusion industry.
515
And we're starting to see people go and attack those entrepreneurially, which I think shows the seriousness of the industry.
516
And now it's more nuanced.
517
That comes after a period where everyone thought they had to build full-stack fusion companies.
518
And to go from that to a more nuanced supply chain capability set, I think has been very, very good.
519
Same evolution happens in commercial space.
520
Vinod, are there particular areas that you're excited to see innovation around within fusion energy?
521
Well, within fusion energy, almost every part will be innovated behind it.
522
There's multiple scales of power plants that need to be built from 500 megawatts to 5 gigawatts to 50 kilowatts.
523
So you will see proliferation of these approaches.
524
But I think the most exciting piece will be how electricity is used when it's near limitless.
525
I think we'll see a lot more innovation on that side.
526
A lot of the cost of delivering AI is, in fact, electricity.
527
So that will become scalable at a very large level.
528
I think we don't have the imagination yet to figure all this out, but downstream of fusion power generation, we'll see many more uses.
529
Even how mining and minerals are done may actually change.
530
And so I can't wait to see all the side effects, the positive side effects of real fusion energy being available.
531
Amazing.
532
Well, I'd love to ask you both just two short sort of wrap-up questions.
533
The first one is: if you had the power to assign a book to everyone on Earth to read and understand, what book would you assign?
534
Richard Dawkins has a book I don't even remember.
535
It's all, I forget the subtitle, but that's the book I would assign.
536
It's imagination to pursue a lot of things.
537
I love that.
538
What about you, Bob?
539
One of my favorites is the Intel Trinity, which is the history of Intel, which, if you want to talk about a civilization-changing innovation, you have to trace that all the way back to the Fairchild and the founding of that company, and then all the way through Grove and OKRs, what it is today.
540
You know, obviously, it has had some hard times, but you can't discredit the change that they ushered in.
541
Here, you know, we are sitting on computers that were completely unimaginable without that technology.
542
Amazing.
543
Full circle, the historian of technology picks a beautiful technology history book.
544
By the way, the full title of that book is Unveening the Rainbow: The Appetite for Science, Delusion, and Wonder.
545
Amazing.
546
The final question would be: How do you think historians will describe our era in 50 years' time?
547
Our era right now, the historical context for it, like the closest analogy, I think, is like the 1890s to 1910s, where you had a mixture of a new world emerging, cars, planes, radio.
548
At the same time, you still have people doing subsistence.
549
But change was happening very quickly, and technical technologies were advancing, some of which were marvelous, some of which were scary.
550
I find that that feels like what we're in right now.
551
Just now, we're taking all the things that have happened in software and compute, and they're moving back into the real world and into atoms, bits, and atoms emerging.
552
And that's super exciting.
553
Sinod, how does that sound to you?
554
What would you say?
555
That sounds great.
556
I would add my favorite is when entrepreneurs imagine the possible and then try and make them happen.
557
Whether they succeed or fail, that is where large progress happens.
558
And even from the failures, people learn.
559
But if a small percentage succeed, it changes the world.
560
And this is about doing that.
561
I can't think of a single change in the last 40 years I've been doing around technology and entrepreneurship that was driven by a large company, incumbent conventional wisdom.
562
It doesn't matter what area you look at, and I'm sure there's some areas.
563
Every large change was driven by somebody imagining the possible, trying to make that happen without having any guarantee of success.
564
And I think it's that risk-taking culture that matters.
565
Well, I've been very grateful to spend time with two people imagining what's possible.
566
Thank you.
567
That's it.
