1
Everyone's always promoting dog fooding.
2
It feels though that you take this to a whole other level.
3
Either once or twice a month, I will set aside half a day and then I'll go out and I'll drive and deliver.
4
My team and I, we design these amazing features, they look so good.
5
And then you get in the car and you have a phone which is sitting three feet away from you.
6
You're driving at 45 miles per hour.
7
The world just changes.
8
This thing that was looking so great in an office setting now maybe makes no sense.
9
When I was asking people about you and what you're amazing at, a motto came up again and again.
10
It was ship, ship, ship.
11
If we are going to go dog food and experience this pain and you're going to document it, what's next?
12
You have to ship this.
13
You don't ship documents.
14
You don't ship brainstorming meetings.
15
What you ship is code in your product.
16
What are some of the most impactful pieces of advice that you share with early career product people?
17
What makes a great product manager is not five amazing strategic ideas, it's the house and micro decisions that you made.
18
Where should I put the button?
19
Should I put the screen there or not?
20
What should the copy say?
21
Go to a job where you can ship multiple products as fast as possible.
22
Today, my guest is Sachin Konsel.
23
Sachin is chief product officer at Uber, where he's been for over eight years and where he leads product management, design, and product operations.
24
Prior to Uber, Sachin was chief product officer at Flywheel, a VP of product at Lookout.
25
He also spent the early part of his career at Palm, where he was director of product management, focused on Palm's mobile operating system, WebOS, and their mobile apps.
26
In our conversation, we go deep into his passion for dog fooding and how he makes this a big part of the product culture at Uber.
27
He's personally done hundreds and hundreds of drives as an Uber driver and also as an Uber Eats Delivery person.
28
I've had a lot of people come on this podcast talk about dog fooding.
29
I've never met anyone that takes it to the extreme that Sachin does.
30
Much of what the product team works on at Uber comes from what he and his team discover from these experiences.
31
We also talk about why it's important to always have a ship-ship-ship mentality, PM career advice for early career PMs, how Uber is planning for a future with increasingly autonomous cars, and what changes over time, what he's learned from Uber's shift to efficiency and profitability.
32
Also, a bunch of really good tips for how to avoid annoying your Uber driver and Uber Eats delivery person.
33
This episode is full of wisdom for anyone who wants to build better products, teams, and cultures.

38
Many of you are building AI products, which is why I'm very excited to chat with Brandon Fu, founder and CEO of Paragon.
39
Hey, Brandon.
40
Hey, Lenny, thanks for having me.
41
So, integrations have become a big deal for AI products.
42
Why is that?
43
Integrations are mission-critical for AI for two reasons.
44
First, AI products need context from their customers' business data, such as Google Drive files, Slack messages, or CRM records.
45
Second, for AI products to automate work on behalf of users, AI agents need to be able to take action across these different third-party tools.
46
So, where does Paragon fit into all this?
47
Well, these integrations are a pain to build, and that's why Paragon provides an embedded platform that enables engineers to ship these product integrations in just days instead of months, across every use case, from rag data ingestion to agentic actions.
48
And I know from first-hand experience that maintenance is even harder than just building it for the first time.
49
Exactly.
50
We believe product teams should focus engineering efforts and competitive advantages, not integrations.
51
If you want to avoid wasting months of engineering on integrations that your customers need, check out Paragon at useparagon.com/slash Lenny.

Last year, 1.3% of the global GDP flowed through Stripe.
53
That's over $1.4 trillion.
54
And driving that huge number are the millions of businesses growing more rapidly with Stripe.
55
For industry leaders like Forbes, Atlassian, OpenAI, and Toyota, Stripe isn't just financial software.
56
It's a powerful partner that simplifies how they move money, making it as seamless and borderless as the internet itself.
57
For example, Hertz boosted its online payment authorization rates by 4% after migrating to Stripe.
58
And imagine seeing a 23% lift in revenue, like Forbes did just six months after switching to Stripe for subscription management.
59
Stripe has been leveraging AI for the last decade to make its product better at growing revenue for all businesses, from smarter checkouts to fraud prevention and beyond.

62
Sachin, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.
63
It is great to be here, Lenny.
64
Thank you for having me.
65
When we were exploring what to chat about and where to spend our time, there was a bunch of themes that came up both in our conversations and also when I was talking to people that work with you at Uber and other places.
66
And the theme that came up over and over is dog fooding.
67
And dog fooding is something that comes up a bunch on this podcast.
68
Everyone's always promoting dogfooding.
69
It feels that you take this to a whole other level and you do this better than anyone I've ever spoken to.
70
You're basically world-class in dog fooding.
71
There's a lot I want to talk about here.
72
But before we get into it, just like give us a sense of what dog fooding looks like in your world.
73
What is the scale that you go to to dog food Uber?
74
I mean, call it dog fooding, call it, you know, just obsession about the products that we ask our end users to use, and we should be using it ourselves.
75
So in my world, what it looks like, there are a few apps in my world.
76
There's a rider app that everyone's familiar with.
77
There's the Uber Eats app.
78
And let's not forget, there's a driver and a courier app as well.
79
So dog fooding looks like the following for me in general, on an average.
80
I end up taking maybe five to 10 trips or Uber rides every week, which is, you know, just happens because I'm an Uber rider.
81
Now, when I'm traveling, that's probably even more.
82
I end up placing maybe three orders, three Uber Eats orders every week.
83
Sometimes that's too much.
84
And again, when I'm traveling, that could increase.
85
If I'm traveling with family, it can be a lot.
86
It could be literally all our meals.
87
So those are probably more explainable, more understandable.
88
The volume goes up and down.
89
But then, how do you test the driver app?
90
So I actually go out either once or twice a month.
91
I will set aside half a day or a day.
92
And then I'll go out and I'll drive and deliver here in the Bay Area.
93
So I've been doing that for many, many years now.
94
I will say that's probably one of the best parts of my job.
95
I really, really enjoy it, you know, doing trips as well as doing deliveries.
96
And I'll do maybe every time I go out, I'll do about.
97
That's the fun part.
98
The painful part then is: okay, what did I learn?
99
Because it's very easy for me to do this and then just completely forget about it, not document it, use it anecdotally in some conversation, but not be able to go into a lot of detail.
100
So, what I do after each of these instances, whether it's using the rider app or whether it is driving, I take a lot of screenshots, and then I come back and I write documents or I add to an existing document.
101
So, I have a driver document, I have a rider app document, I have an Uber Eats document, and I'll come back and I'll just write everything that I learned that is probably not ideal.
102
I'll add a lot of screenshots to that doc.
103
I will tag people because I know who works on what, and then I'll just send people my thoughts on what we think we can improve.
104
And after that, we have a process internally which, you know, where we go through all of those issues, we prioritize them.
105
Not everything that I thought is a great idea is necessarily a great idea.
106
So, we go through all of that and then we fix issues.
107
And I'm not the only one dog fooding in the company, but I do follow through on the things that I reported and make sure that things that should be fixed get fixed and as quickly as possible.
108
So, that's the sort of the end-to-end journey of dog fooding for me in my work.
109
How many trips have you taken?
110
How many rides have you driven?
111
How many food delivery trips have you done total?
112
Like, what are the numbers here just like over your time, Duber?
113
I think from a driving and delivering perspective.
114
And I don't know as a passenger how many trips I have done.
115
I can't count that.
116
And same for Uber Eats, but the driving and delivering is many hundred trips.
117
Wow, yeah.
118
I think on the riding on Uber and getting food delivered, that's not so hard.
119
To your point, the real hard part is driving and delivering people's foods and taking them places.
120
Also, on the docks, I think you're also underselling yourself.
121
When your colleagues, Ricky, told me that you write 40-page reports on what's broken with screenshots and suggested fixes.
122
And then you, like you said, you follow up on all these fixes.
123
Like, you don't just put them out there and then hope people do something with it.
124
You actually stay on top of them and make people feel accountable.
125
Lenny, I get when I find those issues in our app, I develop a bit of impatience.
126
Because if I faced it in my 10 trips that day, we have 8 million couriers and drivers in the world, right?
127
So imagine the number of times that thing may have happened to our customers, which are drivers and couriers.
128
So I develop a bit of an impatience that we have to fix it.
129
We can't.
130
Now, some things are small, some things are big.
131
I develop different levels of impatience for different things depending on the level of severity.
132
And then if I don't follow up or my team doesn't follow up, and if we don't fix it, then it's a moot point.
133
Then I'm just doing it for fun, which is not bad.
134
It's great for me to be doing it for fun.
135
But I want to do it for impact.
136
And I also want to do it for setting an example with my team as well.
137
Now, again, I'm not the only one dog fooding.
138
We have hundreds to thousands of people at Uber.
139
We want it to be a part of the culture, but we don't want the culture to be that every individual product manager.
140
We want the culture to be that every leader is doing that as well.
141
And that's why I don't want to be shy about or want to shy away from writing these documents because I want everyone to.
142
And now there are many, many documents written by many, many people at Uber.
143
And honestly, it's making our products better.
144
And even more, I would say, even more important than the specific features that we fix or we add, it's the culture of, you know, we're not just going to accept certain problems in our products, we're actually going to fix them.
145
That's really, really important.
146
So let's talk about just why this is so important to you.
147
I want to talk about how you operationalize this and the culture of it at Uber.
148
But just, you know, as a CPO, I don't know of many that go drop people off, you know, hundreds of times, deliver food to people's houses hundreds of times.
149
I imagine you have many things you got to do day to day.
150
There's hiring, there's, you know, drama, fires, all these things.
151
Why do you prioritize this so highly?
152
Here's my framework of how we think about end users.
153
Of course, end-user feedback is important.
154
Everyone would agree with that.
155
Every product manager, every product leader would agree with that.
156
How do you get that end-user feedback, I think, falls on a spectrum.
157
There's the extreme quantitative end of the spectrum, and there's the extreme qualitative end of the spectrum.
158
And I like to believe that you need to be across that spectrum.
159
So on the extremely quantitative part, we all love data.
160
We all look at charts.
161
And in those charts, every user is an MAU or a DAU.
162
Every user is a number.
163
And collectively, as those numbers, users are showing certain behaviors, and we learn a lot.
164
And now you may go into things like surveys, where you're actually sending out surveys to thousands of riders.
165
You're quantitatively understanding do they like A, do they like B, do they like C, which is also very, very valuable.
166
Then you get into a little bit, you know, to the center.
167
Maybe I have a room of 10 drivers and I'm asking them.
168
It's a focus group.
169
It's a discussion.
170
And for an hour, I learn a lot from them.
171
It becomes very interesting.
172
We do this.
173
Anytime I go to a Brazil office, I go to our India office, I go to a UK office.
174
At a minimum, I do one or two roundtables with drivers.
175
I also do roundtables with riders.
176
It's just extremely valuable to hear from them directly.
177
You move one step further, and now I may have a one-to-one conversation with one of them.
178
By the way, in the rides that I take every single day, it's such an amazing opportunity for me to do two things.
179
As a passenger, I'm talking to the driver for 30 minutes off my commute, and I'm basically one-on-one interviewing them.
180
And because the driver app is placed in a certain way, I can actually see how they use the driver app.
181
So that actually drives me a lot of learning.
182
And every day there's an aha moment that, oh, I, you know, this is what he just did.
183
A text message came in, and then he left the driver app, and then he went and addressed the text message, and so on.
184
So this is what you learn.
185
All of that is great.
186
However, until I get behind the wheel, or I am a passenger, or I am using Uber Eats, what I miss is the visceral reaction that you get when something happens.
187
So now think about it.
188
I sit in my office, my team and I, we design these amazing features.
189
They look so good on my MacBook or on a Zoom screen.
190
And then you get in the car and you have a phone which is sitting three feet away from you.
191
You're driving at 45 miles per hour.
192
The world just changes.
193
This thing that was looking so great in an office setting now maybe makes no sense, or there's a lot of stuff that you have to change.
194
So, that's sort of what you feel.
195
But then, as you are trying to make money doing that, every single little inefficiency, every single flaw is costing me my earnings.
196
And while I don't do it for money, so I don't think I can get to the extreme, extreme end of how drivers feel, I think I can get close.
197
And the only way for me to feel that emotion is by doing it myself.
198
And I do think that that emotion is very important.
199
I'm a big believer in then bringing that emotion to my work.
200
Whether it's an emotion of joy, I have many, many moments of joy, and I bring that back and I celebrate that.
201
And that's very motivating for my team and I.
202
But there are many emotions of outrage.
203
And I want to bring that to work as well and make sure that we can use it as a motivator to do better.
204
So, those are my reasons to be dogfooding.
205
What's an example of something that super outraged you, that you experienced as a driver, especially, and/or something that maybe is the most surprising that you learned as a driver?
206
Let me start with the surprising, and then I think we'll get to the outrage part of it.
207
And there may be things that you may not expect.
208
The surprising thing, as I mentioned before, was how the app just feels different when it's actually in a moving car at 40 to 60 to 70 miles per hour.
209
That was a surprise for me.
210
I get an offer, it's 20 bucks.
211
I'm picking someone up from point A, I'm dropping them off at point B.
212
There's a bit of an excitement angle.
213
And I don't want to overplay it.
214
You know, earners, drivers work really, really hard to do their job.
215
But I think that part of our product, there's a bit of an excitement to it.
216
That was a surprise to me.
217
I will go into a few individual features, but even at a more meta level, the thing that surprised me the most is we obsess about our app, and our app is the center of our universe.
218
But when a passenger gets in the car, the center of the driver's universe is that interaction with the passenger.
219
That human touch between the driver and the passenger is something that we don't talk about in the office enough.
220
And if you talk to the driver, and when I'm a driver, if the passenger is friendly, it lifts my mood.
221
If the passenger is grumpy, then I'm unsure what to do.
222
If the passenger is rude, which has also happened, that can really be demotivating.
223
I want to share one anecdote with you.
224
This was way back, like almost eight years ago, when I started driving.
225
This was probably my fifth or sixth trip.
226
So I was very, very early in my journey of dog fooding.
227
So it was early morning.
228
I think it was a Saturday morning, maybe about 7 a.m.
229
I was picking someone up.
230
It was a lady.
231
I stopped my car on the curbside.
232
She got in.
233
She was going to the airport.
234
She was going to San Jose Airport.
235
And she had a suitcase, which she left on the curb.
236
And she's inside the car.
237
And I'm like, what's going on?
238
And it suddenly dawned on me that she's expecting me to get out of my car, grab her suitcase, open the trunk.
239
And then I suddenly realized that there is an expectation of me as the driver doing that part of the job as well.
240
And since I was very early in my journey, I had not internalized that.
241
And the kind of emotions that ran through me at that time just explained to me, hey, what does a driver actually go through?
242
That was a somber ride for me.
243
That was a somber day for me.
244
And since that day, I have not forgotten what it feels like to be a driver.
245
And I carry that emotion with me.
246
And that has built a level of empathy in my mind for drivers.
247
And I want to make sure that my team understands that's their life.
248
And everything we build for them has to have that level of empathy.
249
And I would say that was a big surprise for me.
250
It's not just about the app.
251
Yes, there are many features in the app that we can talk about, which are also surprising.
252
But what does a driver feel day in and day out as they interact with other human beings was a big one for me.
253
I love that.
254
I want to talk about how you actually disseminate this culture within the product team.
255
But out of curiosity, I always wonder what pisses off a driver as a rider.
256
For example, do drivers like short rides or do they like long rides?
257
Does it not matter?
258
I think the short or long rides can be very personal.
259
There are some drivers, and the great thing about our driver base is there's a lot of heterogeneity in terms of their preferences.
260
Some of them do like short trips because it keeps them closer to their home.
261
They can make a decision to go back whenever they want.
262
Sometimes we have incentives, which, you know, if they do 20 trips and they get something more, they are able to do that.
263
And some of them just like a long trip because they don't want to do multiple pickups and drop-offs.
264
So I think there's a lot of heterogeneity.
265
If you want a tip, I'll give you a couple of tips.
266
It's totally okay for you to be on the phone.
267
We have to do that.
268
Just ask them for permission to say, Are you okay if I'm on the phone?
269
They will always say yes, but it will just annoy them a lot less.
270
So that's number one thing that I've learned.
271
The number two, on your way out, do not slam the door.
272
It is their car, it is their final moment of interaction with you.
273
Close the door and do it softly.
274
That will ensure that you actually get good ratings from the driver.
275
These are great tips.
276
I know you can check your actual rating now in the Uber app as a passenger.
277
And so it's not 5.0 for most people, including myself.
278
So this is good to know what might have caused that.
279
Oh, man.
280
Okay, one other just that I want to follow here is: like, you spending so much time on the experience implies that that is a huge lever for growth and retention and long-term success.
281
A lot of people in growth and product don't see it that way.
282
They focus on what's a metric we can drive, what's like a conversion opportunity here.
283
They're not just like, how do we just make this experience better?
284
Can you just talk about that insight of just like why you believe just making that experience better is so important?
285
I think it's not an or, it's an end.
286
I do think that obsessing over your metrics, especially when it's funnel metrics and understanding all the points of friction, numbers do tell the story.
287
So I think you do need to have the experience points, whether they are observed anecdotally or they come through some other means, as well as understanding the points of friction because of drop-off and your conversion.
288
Because if, I mean, you're talking about end users, if it becomes just a mathematical exercise, I don't think that is enough.
289
Because as I mentioned, what they are actually feeling in the moment is something that numbers will never show.
290
And numbers will not bring the level of intensity that emotions will bring.
291
Now, the question is: do you have a culture that allows coexistence of both?
292
Does it allow a coexistence of you bringing emotion as well as the numbers?
293
And that's what I am trying to create every day.
294
Our leadership team is trying to create every day.
295
The product team, the engineering team is trying to create every day.
296
And I think you've done a good job of having a coexistence of those two in the company.
297
Okay.
298
And then, so how do you operationalize this and make this a part of the culture at the company?
299
Clearly, part of it is modeling it and just doing a lot of it yourself.
300
What else do you do to help product people build this empathy and dog food as much as you do, or to some extent?
301
I mean, I do it, Tara does it.
302
So there is definitely, you know, just doing by example or teaching by example.
303
We also organize around it because I think creating a little bit of an organization around it just helps.
304
We are a large company now, and we try to assist with this by centrally organizing.
305
This means let's make sure that everyone understands what it means to be an Uber driver, how to sign up for an Uber driver.
306
Some people may be on visas and so on.
307
So there is a regulatory part of that.
308
So we make sure that everyone understands how to sign up.
309
Then we also organize every year.
310
So we have hundreds of employees who go out and drive and deliver.
311
And there's a competition of who can do the most number of trips and who can bring in the most amount of feedback in terms of things to improve.
312
And we have prices and so on.
313
And that's just taken off over the last, I would say, especially the last two to three years post-COVID, because during COVID, I think it was a little bit harder for us to gather everyone together.
314
And then the last thing I'll say is: what do you do with all of that feedback?
315
Because that's when the quote-unquote boring part starts.
316
Now you're gathering all these documents, you're taking all those issues, you're putting them in your Jira tracking or whatever tracker you may be using and you're fixing them.
317
So what we have done is we have set a six-monthly OKR.
318
So we have set an OKR that we are going to fix 300 of these issues, every team actually.
319
The driver team will fix 300 of those issues.
320
The rider team will fix 300 of these issues.
321
And same for the Uber Eats team.
322
Now, I don't really care whether it's 300 or 200 or 500.
323
The number actually doesn't matter, but the fact that there is a number is what matters.
324
And we have been hitting those targets every single half over the last two to three years.
325
So these are some of the things that we do to operationalize it and make sure that people understand that this behavior is not just expected, but it's also rewarded.
326
I imagine what's challenging about this is there's also work to do that will clearly drive growth, will clearly cut down like support tickets, will help with infrastructure costs.
327
So these OKRs, there's like, just fix these things that we know suck.
328
We don't know what good they'll do, but we know they're not good.
329
How do you kind of balance that in resource and prioritization versus like all these other things on the roadmap that you know are going to drive a metric?
330
We have a pretty good balanced set of OKRs.
331
So, let's say one of our teams has six OKRs, just illustratively, over the next six months.
332
One of them would be, we call them fix-its.
333
So, we sign up for 300 fix-its for the next six months.
334
In addition to that, we do sign up for a growth goal, we sign up for a retention goal, we sign up for a cost savings goal, and each of them have projects behind them.
335
And the executional rigor is a pretty big part of Uber.
336
So, for all of those projects, we actually have, and I get engaged in that as well, we have pretty serious executional rigor.
337
Now, OKRs are not meant to be hit 100%.
338
I think we celebrate if we hit about 75 to 80% because you do want to set stretch targets.
339
And then, you know, every half we do planning and we will allocate resources between all of those OKRs.
340
So, fix-its, for example, don't get all the resources, but they also don't get zero resources, which may have been the case if we had not set a culture which celebrated this and allocated resources towards this and rewarded this.
341
Awesome.
342
Okay.
343
Like, clearly, an important ingredient here is the CO and C-suite on down values this as something we will invest in.
344
And we'll trade off all focus on growth for this because we believe this is going to help us grow and win long term.
345
Absolutely.
346
Absolutely.
347
Some people hearing this, just as a final question along this area, are going to feel like, okay, Uber, so easy to talk for.
348
Of course.
349
But a lot of people work at like, you know, Oracle and Snowflake and like, I don't know, 5tran, all these companies where it's much less, you know, non-consumer product, essentially, where it's more difficult to dog food.
350
Just any advice for folks that want to create a culture of dog fooding and kind of up their dog food game at a product that isn't consumery?
351
So, first of all, we thought the same when we thought about the driver app as well, because it was a little bit distant for people.
352
Now, I would say, while it is more difficult than just ordering food and taking a ride, it is not as difficult as perhaps some of the other products that you mentioned.
353
But I do think that you just stretch that even further.
354
We do have a product we call Uber for Business, where it's a business admin using it.
355
We do have our merchant product.
356
So, Uber Eats is actually three sides of the marketplace: the eater, the consumer, the courier who's bringing your food, and there's a restaurant.
357
Now, how do I dog food the restaurant product, for example?
358
So, these questions are very, very valid.
359
So, my guidance would be, and what I try to do is try to get as close to that customer as possible.
360
So, in the case of a merchant, we go spend time at restaurants.
361
I'll give you a latest one.
362
So, we have a cafe here at Uber on campus.
363
We also have a barista.
364
So, we enable the barista to be an Uber Eats restaurant.
365
And they have an Uber Eats tablet, and I can actually order from that barista.
366
So, now you're dog fooding being an eater, you're dog fooding being a courier.
367
So, some of my product team actually will go to the barista, they'll stand behind the counter, and they'll experience what it feels like for these orders to come in.
368
We have very close relationships with our big customers, such as McDonald's or Domino's, and all of them.
369
We also have a lot of small, medium business restaurants, and we have relationships with them, which allows us to go and spend days with them so that we can observe what life is like behind the counter for a restaurant worker, for a kitchen worker, how does our product show up?
370
And we learn a lot of stuff, Lenny.
371
And I would say I would ask everyone who's listening, irrespective of the product that they're working on, go to the nth degree of how much you can stretch.
372
And if it's really an IT admin at your customer who's using your product, I would do two things: A, go to that ID admin and sit next to them and observe them using the product.
373
And B, set up what we call test accounts and try to pretend to be an IT admin and set up that account.
374
I went through our merchant setup flow, which I can just do by setting up a test account.
375
And I learned so many things of all the points of friction that we are putting in that flow.
376
So, I think there is still a lot that you can do, even if you do not have a consumer product.
377
Awesome.
378
So, the advice there is just find a way, get as close as you can.
379
You may not be able to ride an Uber, drive an Uber car, get an Uber ride, but there's some way you can get really close.
380
You may not be exactly do the thing.
381
Awesome.
382
Okay.
383
I'm going to go in a different direction.
384
And there's another theme that came up again and again when I was asking people about you and what you're amazing at.
385
And a motto came up again.
386
Why is this motto, this way of working, so important to you?
387
Why is it something you try to encourage everyone to always think about?
388
I think it's actually a natural extension of what we just talked about.
389
If we are going to go dog food and experience this pain and we are going to document it, what's next?
390
We have to ship this.
391
I'm a big believer in you don't ship documents, you don't ship brainstorming meetings, you don't even ship designs in a Figma.
392
What you ship is code in your product.
393
That is the only thing that actually ultimately has impact on the end user.
394
So, as I mentioned before, I develop a sense of impatience.
395
It's a positive impatience, if you will, that, okay, I just observed a problem for our riders or for our drivers.
396
They have to get a solution to that as soon as possible.
397
And for that, you have to ship, ship, ship.
398
Now, you could interpret ship-ship-ship to be just mindlessly shipping.
399
No, this is not about mindlessly shipping.
400
But once you know that you're working on something that is important, that is solving a problem, it could be a big feature or a small feature, then you have to cut down the cycle time.
401
My biggest enemy is the cycle time of we know it is a good thing, all the way to our user seeing it, you have to minimize that time.
402
So that's why ship-ship-ship has become such a motto for me.
403
And we try to do a lot of things internally, operationally, for us to enable that.
404
And I'll say we still are not there.
405
In my opinion, I think we can still be faster, we can still cut a lot of that cycle time, but we are on a constant quest to get as good as we can.
406
What does this look like in practice?
407
To your point, not just work all night and all day, you know, shipping long, staying long hours.
408
Just what are some ways to actually operationalize this?
409
I think it stems from the cutting down cycle time, which is the time it takes to make decisions.
410
I realize that a lot of the time is not, I mean, all the time that you spend documenting the requirements or designing the product or actually writing code is time really, really well spent.
411
All the time that is spent in between those activities to align, to discuss a decision, to not make up your mind, then have a meeting the next week, or let's regroup two weeks from now.
412
That happens in our companies a lot.
413
The question is, how do you cut that down?
414
And for that, what we do is we have product reviews.
415
And as much as possible, we try to come out with decisions in those product reviews.
416
And you have to operate in a one-way door versus two-way door concept.
417
If something is a two-way door, you have to be able to make the call quickly.
418
And you want to make a good call, but if you get it wrong, it's okay.
419
We can turn it back.
420
If it is a one-way door, if it's a massive launch, sure, it's okay for it to take some deliberation.
421
Maybe it even goes to the C-suite and we have a discussion.
422
But my guidance to my team is: cut down the decision-making that has to happen, or to cut down the time required for the decision-making between those various steps.
423
A few things I heard that you do that Yunin mentioned that I think help with this.
424
One is that there was a period where you ran daily stand-ups with cross-functional.
425
There's another story I heard where you wrote a 15-page PRD over the weekend to unblock a stalled team.
426
Feels like these are kind of look for opportunities to unblock, essentially.
427
Well, I want that to be an exception rather than the rule.
428
But yes, I want to be able to step in, or I want all our leaders to be able to step in when needed.
429
I think you have to be hands-on.
430
You have to be hands-on when needed.
431
You know, those two examples, we were coming out of COVID, we had a massive shortage of drivers on our platform.
432
And we were talking about growth earlier, and we had clear goals on how we grow the number of drivers on our platform, all the way from getting new drivers in and improving the funnel, as well as retaining existing drivers.
433
And Lenny, there was no shortage of the number of ideas.
434
But again, there was a problem with cycle time.
435
So I said, great, our cycle time is going to be 24 hours.
436
And so there was, I think there was a period of about six months when we did do daily stand-ups, and they were extremely helpful to unblock the teams on making certain decisions.
437
And we shipped a lot.
438
And I think it took us about nine to 12 months, but we were able to come out the other side having a great number of drivers.
439
And the great thing is that what we did in our driver and courier funnel at that time is still paying off because the number of drivers and couriers continues to grow.
440
And now we are worldwide at about an 8 million number.
441
And we were probably close to half of that when we were just out of COVID.
442
So that's an example of where daily standards help.
443
I try to minimize that.
444
The PRD example, yes, I did write a PRD, it was a 15-page PRD.
445
We were working on a pretty big concept, and it was a risky concept, and it was driver-facing, and that's always sort of high stakes.
446
And we had about, by this time, we had had about 20 conversations and brainstorm meetings and documents that had been written with the best intentions.
447
But the thing that was not becoming clear is: hey, what should we actually ship?
448
Because there were a lot of good ideas and not-so-good ideas, but no one was actually putting it all together to say, this is what you're going to ship.
449
So it was one Sunday night, and I literally, it took me two hours.
450
And I just wrote down, I'm like, guys, this is my stake in the ground.
451
We can completely change it, but this is the product we will ship, agree or disagree.
452
Now, the product that we eventually shipped was at least 50% different than what I had written down, but it just catalyzed us getting to that end point.
453
Now, if I were to do that every single day or every single week, then I would say there's a problem.
454
Yeah, you wouldn't have time to deliver food and give rides.
455
That is exactly right.
456
Or I would not have time to do hiring, or I would not have time to do performance reviews and so on.
457
But once in a while, I think it's totally fine for product leaders to step in, especially if you're trying to remove ambiguity and you're trying to just speed decisions up.
458
It's okay to step in and be hands-on.
459
Another tactic that I heard that I think that I want to ask you about: someone anonymously said that you ask for live demos.
460
And here's the question: he always insists on doing live demos that make everyone nervous when they present.
461
The question is, why?
462
So I think they may be talking about when we do product announcements.
463
So we do, when we do insist on actually live demoing the product.
464
Part of this comes from, you know, I grew up as a product manager back in the day in the 2000s at Palm.
465
Palm was the Palm pilot.
466
Palm sort of was cut from the Apple clock.
467
There were a lot of ex-Apple people there.
468
And, you know, you were in the consumer electronics business.
469
And every single year, the way you would announce your product is you would get up on stage and you show the product working.
470
And leading up to that moment was a lot of massive amount of work to make sure that it actually works on stage.
471
Now, I will say there's an internal reason and an external reason to do this.
472
The external reason to do this is you have to tell a story.
473
One of my other beliefs is, which I may not have shared before, is no one actually really cares about the feature that you want to talk about.
474
People are way too busy.
475
You're obsessed about your product.
476
Your products are your life.
477
But for your end users, your products are maybe 10 minutes of their life once a week.
478
So their life does not center around your product.
479
They don't care.
480
How do you make them care?
481
You have to tell a story.
482
And that story comes from actually showing the product in action rather than a lot of slideware and pictures.
483
So that is my belief: that I don't want to have hubris about my own product.
484
I need to be able to tell a story about how an end user will actually get value out of that.
485
That's my external reason for why I insist on live demos.
486
My internal reasons for why I insist on a live demo is while it is a lot of work, I think it creates a certain level of rigor ahead of time before the product is ready to launch.
487
Because if it is going up on stage, it has to work.
488
And two, what, you know, you may ask the same person who asked you this, it creates such a sense of pride amongst the product team and the engineering team to actually see their product live on stage.
489
And now it's on video and it will stay forever to see the product that they put their blood, sweat, and tears into actually working.
490
I think that's a huge moment of pride.
491
And I take it as personal responsibility to make sure that I can help sort of bring that moment.
492
But yes, leading up to that is a lot of work.
493
A lot of stress.
494
Okay, that was a great answer.
495
Today's episode is brought to you by Coda.
496
I personally use Coda every single day to manage my podcast and also to manage my community.
497
It's where I put the questions that I plan to ask every guest that's coming on the podcast.
498
It's where I put my community resources.
499
It's how I manage my workflows.
500
Here's how Coda can help you.
501
Imagine starting a project at work and your vision is clear.
502
You know exactly who's doing what and where to find the data that you need to do your part.
503
In fact, you don't have to waste time searching for anything because everything your team needs from project trackers and OKRs to documents and spreadsheets lives in one tab, all in Coda.
504
With Coda's collaborative all-in-one workspace, you get the flexibility of docs, the structure of spreadsheets, the power of applications, and the intelligence of AI, all in one easy-to-organize tab.
505
Like I mentioned earlier, I use Coda every single day, and more than 50,000 teams trust Coda to keep them more aligned and focused.
506
If you're a startup team looking to increase alignment and agility, go to coda.io/slash Lenny today and get six months free of the team plan for startups.
507
That's coda.io/slash lenny to get started for free and get six months of the team plan.

509
I'm going to shift our conversation a bit to general career advice.
510
I've got a bunch of questions.
511
I actually asked the community, my newsletter Slack community, what to ask you.
512
And they had a few really good questions that want to run by you.
513
So, one is just what are some of the most impactful and recurring pieces of advice that you share with early career product people that you find most helps them get unstuck and most helps them move to where they want to move in their career?
514
One is go to a job where you can ship multiple products as fast as possible.
515
Comes back to cycle time, where you can, let's say over a period of two to three years, you can go through three to five product cycles as fast as possible because you want to put that under your belt.
516
Don't worry too much about how you show up in a room.
517
Don't try to spend too much time on being the smartest guy in the room.
518
Just define the product, work with your engineering, with your design team, with your data team, and ship that product, rev that product, iterate on that product, ship the next product.
519
What you will find as you do that over those two to three years, three years later, you'll suddenly realize that, wow, I've actually shipped a lot.
520
And the other thing that I strongly believe is what makes a great product manager is not the five amazing strategic ideas you had over those three years, it's the thousand micro decisions that you made, not the five macro decisions that you made, but the thousand micro decisions that you made.
521
Where should I put the button?
522
Should I put the screen there or not?
523
What should the copy say?
524
Do I launch this product in Atlanta or in New Jersey?
525
You go through these, and what you want at the end of that is you'll start developing an innate sense of judgment.
526
So you want to increase your cycle time to be able to get to judgment as fast as possible.
527
Because when you make a similar decision the 10th time, you don't even have to think about it.
528
It just happens.
529
And we, you know, constantly talk about experimentation versus gut or data versus gut.
530
As you progress in your career, you want to develop that gut as fast as possible.
531
Because in my opinion, that's what differentiates a good product manager from a great product manager.
532
That they have developed some extra level of gut and they are able to make the correct decisions because of the experience that they have had over that time.
533
Another way to label what you're describing as product sense, which is something a lot of people are always told they should be building and are very unsure how to go about building it.
534
And what I love about your advice here is: this is how you find a place where you could just ship over and over and over and keep that cycle time down.
535
And there's almost like implicit advice here: if you're working at a company that takes a long time to ship, this is probably not a good place to be starting your career.
536
That's right.
537
That's right.
538
Another question from the community.
539
This is from James Conway.
540
He asked that, okay, so you've been a product for about 25 years, something like that at this point, right?
541
That's right.
542
24 years, 24 years.
543
24, okay, almost 25.
544
Almost there.
545
Oh man, that's a long time.
546
Okay, so the question is: what's remained constant throughout your career in product?
547
And do you think that constant will hold even as AI starts to change the way that we build product and build teams?
548
I think there are many things AI is changing, and AI will change.
549
Even if I, you know, what did I work on 24 years ago, or how did I do product management 24 years ago, is different than product management today.
550
The way we write PRDs, the way you do design, the way you make decisions, the fact that you have access to data today didn't really exist 24 years ago.
551
The only data that you had was surveys, and those surveys took six months to run and for data to come back.
552
And now we have instrumentation and telemetry and everything that we ship and we can analyze data.
553
So I would say things have definitely evolved.
554
With AI, things are just going to change even more rapidly.
555
I'm already seeing on a weekly basis, we are introducing a new way of doing things.
556
And if you look at a typical product cycle, all the way from doing market research and user research to writing the first draft of a PRD to doing the first draft of mocks, doing user research, and even storytelling that we talked about, how do I actually tell the story about my product?
557
AI is making all of that much, much easier.
558
And I think that transformation is going to happen very fast.
559
What has not changed?
560
What has not changed in those 24 years is you having to understand what your end users want.
561
And I know that's kind of the cliche of product management.
562
Like, yes, of course, I have to understand what my end user wants.
563
I think it is harder than we.
564
I think it takes more than we typically do to actually really get your finger on the pulse of what your end user feels.
565
And I think that that has stayed constant.
566
I think that is the holy grail.
567
Not just to understand one archetype of an end user.
568
I mean, at Uber here, not only are we operational in 75 different countries, even in a single country like the US, we have different kinds of end users, whether it's demographics, whether it is socioeconomic status.
569
And for us to internalize what do end users want, AI will definitely speed it up.
570
But for a product manager, it is going to stay constant.
571
The one thing I do think product managers need to be aware of is the importance of knowledge is going to stay, it's going to continue.
572
But the importance of judgment and, as you mentioned, product sense and the gut feel, that is going to become even more important in the world of AI.
573
And as a result of that, we need to increase that or reduce that cycle time even more so we can develop that product sense enterprise.
574
Sort of along those lines, there's a question I got from, I don't know if he's the CT of Uber, CTO of part of Uber, Perveen, who I believe you work with at Uber.
575
Yeah.
576
Okay.
577
So the question here was: ask him what he hates from engineers.
578
Does that ring any sort of bells?
579
I think, Lenny, that's a trick question.
580
He wants to get me into trouble, I'm sure.
581
But let me tell you, I actually know the answer to this question.
582
What I hate about engineers is when we work on a project, while I consider that to be important for my job security and a PM's job security, for a PRD to be required, I also think that the best engineers are the ones who actually don't need to start with a PRD.
583
They can have a whiteboarding session with a PM, with a designer.
584
They should have just an equal seat at the table in terms of what we are going to build.
585
And then they co-create.
586
They should co-create.
587
And they should write a document together and they should just build.
588
One of the things that some people like about me and some people probably hate about me is I'm very boundaryless from an org perspective and how I operate.
589
So if someone has a product opinion, it doesn't matter whether you're in the product org or the ops team or customer support or engineering or design.
590
I think everyone's opinion matters and is valid.
591
And I welcome that.
592
I welcome their participation.
593
I don't care about org boundaries.
594
Now, at the same time, I will have an opinion about how we message our products.
595
I will have an opinion about maybe some engineering architecture to the extent that I understand that.
596
Or I will have an opinion about an ad campaign or how we operationalize our products.
597
So in that spirit, what I hate is if we are blocked because a certain document was not written to the nth degree of specificity.
598
I love that you answered the question.
599
That's great.
600
And I think what's also interesting along those lines is it's a lot easier now to write a good version of a PRD/slash one pager with AI tooling, where you kind of just like, here's what I want to build, help me craft it into something very specific that we can use.
601
You could actually convert summaries of those conversations into the first draft of your PRD.
602
So there are many tools available now.
603
So I don't think PMs or engineers have any excuse to be blocked because of lack of PRDs.
604
All right.
605
Amazing.
606
I want to ask a few Uber questions.
607
I think there's a few that a lot of people think about when they think of Uber today.
608
The first is, it feels like there's just this big elephant in the room of what does Uber become as self-driving emerges.
609
You know, we see all these self-driving cars around.
610
Uber's historically been drivers, people driving cars.
611
What is the vision of where Uber goes in a world where self-driving becomes more and more of a thing?
612
Yeah, I mean, it's definitely a big area of conversation internally, externally.
613
So absolutely agree with you on the importance of it.
614
If you rewind back the clock, we actually had our own self-driving unit.
615
And during COVID, we decided to divest our.
616
And we decided that we're going to take a partner-oriented approach.
617
And that is the approach that we have taken since then.
618
Over the last year, we have signed about 15 partners.
619
In fact, we just announced another partner earlier this afternoon called May Mobility.
620
So we have been announcing many, many partners when it comes to A Vs.
621
And now that's our strategy.
622
Now, what does that actually mean?
623
What do these partners do?
624
What we are building is we are building a hybrid network.
625
The hybrid network has a hybrid of human drivers and AVs on the same network.
626
And we work with partners.
627
We have a set of APIs that we have built.
628
It's a very rich set of APIs.
629
And we have partners who basically integrate with those APIs and get access to this hybrid network, this hybrid marketplace.
630
And let me explain why that is beneficial.
631
These cars are expensive.
632
These are assets that need to be utilized.
633
And if let's say a city has 500 AVs, when it is 10:30 a.m.
634
on a Tuesday, mid-morning, we know that demand is going to be really, really low.
635
And you may have a lot of these vehicles actually sit underutilized.
636
Whereas when it is Friday evening at 6 p.m., you don't have enough cars to fulfill the demand that you will have at that point.
637
So if any of these partners try to operate that service themselves, it can definitely work, but you're going to leave either customers dissatisfied or you're going to have underutilization.
638
So our hybrid network really allows them to equalize that because when you don't have enough cars, we are able to send drivers to fulfill that demand.
639
And then given the demand density that Uber brings, we are also able to utilize all the vehicles even if it is 10.30 a.m.
640
on a Tuesday.
641
So that is the value proposition of our network.
642
We are big believers in autonomy.
643
We think autonomy is going to lead to more safety.
644
It is going to take some time.
645
So as we project out, we don't know if it is going to be five years or 10 years till it sees a certain kind of scale across the world, across many, many cities.
646
We are in about 75 countries today, roughly about 15,000 cities.
647
So there's a huge geographical landscape for us to capture as well.
648
But that's our strategy.
649
And so far, we recently launched in Austin with Vemo, and that's been going really well.
650
We've also launched internationally in Abu Dhabi with our partner, WeRide.
651
And then there are many more launches that are going to come down the road.
652
So very excited.
653
And by the way, I talked about mobility.
654
Delivery has something similar.
655
So we have sidewalk robots with many partners who, in a downtown area, for a short-distance delivery, are actually doing thousands of deliveries today.
656
Oh, wow.
657
I've seen those robots.
658
They're very cute.
659
I always wonder how they get to where they are going, but clearly it's working.
660
The Waymo thing, I've totally noticed that Waymo basically, in some form, has decided to move away from their own app in many cities.
661
And Uber is how you get a Waymo, which I don't think a lot of people understand.
662
So what I'm hearing is essentially the strategy is just be the super app for getting around and getting food.
663
And Uber drivers are a part of that.
664
And part of that is autonomous vehicles.
665
And is the idea over time it will stay that way?
666
There will always be a need for humans to drive cars for a long time.
667
I will answer that in two ways, actually.
668
I think for a long, long time, there will be a need for humans to drive cars.
669
There are pickup and drop-off spots that AVs can't go to today.
670
There are going to be regulatory hurdles that we have to get across before AVs are everywhere and so on and so forth.
671
Second, we have a mission to make sure that we can provide a great earnings opportunity on the Uber platform.
672
Today that is fulfilled by driving people and delivering food or delivering groceries.
673
But that list is going to continue to expand.
674
I mean, even me, going back to dog fooding, about I think about a year ago, I also started picking up groceries because now we have a pretty large grocery business.
675
And I have gone and I've carried crates of water up a flight of stairs and delivered that to their doorstep.
676
And, you know, and there are more things that we will do as well.
677
We have a partnership with Walmart where, you know, we may send a courier who may pick up 15 different bags and delivered it to 15 different homes.
678
So the need for human drivers on our platform or human earners, I would say, is just going to continue to increase because we're going to have multiple earning opportunities for them over time.
679
I love that visual of you carrying up big jugs of water to some random person's house.
680
I think that tipped me well.
681
I think that was a good tip.
682
By the way, what do you do with the money you earned from this?
683
Does it just keep it or it's like it goes somewhere?
684
It's so we have a policy that the money actually is not kept by us.
685
We refund it back to the riders or to the eaters.
686
And you just, how do you, how do you, what do they see when they get this refund?
687
They're just like, enjoy.
688
Actually, that's a good question.
689
I think they see, I don't think that it says that, you know, this is because it was delivered by an Uber employee.
690
It's a good question.
691
I should go back and see what it says, but we do refund it back to them.
692
We're dogfooding right here.
693
Yeah.
694
Okay.
695
Another question that I want to touch on is: Uber, it feels like Uber was one of the first companies to take profitability really seriously.
696
I remember Dara tweeting or sharing this insight during COVID, I think, of just like, profitability.
697
We need to change the way we operate.
698
And you guys have clearly done that.
699
It must have been a pretty hard thing to do for a company that was used to just, you know, like famously, all these companies raised a bunch of money, scaled like crazy, blitz, what is it, blitz-scaled, as Reid Hoffman called it.
700
And then making a big change like that, I imagine was very hard.
701
What was that experience like, just kind of switching cultures from just raise money, go crazy to profitable cash flow sort of business?
702
I think it was awesome.
703
I think it was a great, great period because if you're taking inefficiency out of your system and you're taking the dollars you saved back into the business or back into the end user's pockets or the driver's pockets, that's just a great feeling.
704
And as you said, doing that is not easy.
705
It's actually very, very hard.
706
But that's where real innovation actually kicks in.
707
Let me give you an example.
708
One of the ways that you would take cost out of the system in the delivery world is to batch trips together.
709
So when a courier is delivering from point A to point B, maybe they can deliver two packages.
710
They pick both of them up at point A and they deliver them to point B and point C and point B and point C happen to be close together.
711
And there we just delivered a lot of efficiency with the courier's time.
712
And now you multiply that by a thousand different ideas that we may have both in the mobility business as well as the delivery business.
713
And it's a grind, Lenny.
714
There was a grind in terms of how do we take inefficiency out of something like that, which is our core marketplace logic.
715
How do we take inefficiency out of how we do promotions?
716
How do we take inefficiency?
717
There are many, many pockets.
718
And some of that required building new paradigms and building new software.
719
And when you actually save that money and you're able to put that back into the business and become a profitable company so that you don't go under and your stock price goes up, that actually feels very, very rewarding.
720
So I think that Dara has done an excellent job driving that.
721
And I think the company has done an excellent job responding to that.
722
And I feel that that still goes on today.
723
Yes, we became profitable about two years ago.
724
And now, you know, we are driving great margin quarter over quarter.
725
But the spirit of making sure that our core is solid in terms of efficiency, it continues to feed the system and continues to allow us to then make more bets that may be outside of the core.
726
I imagine a lot of companies are going through this same sort of experience now, trying to cut costs, try to be efficient.
727
The government, you know, the U.S.
728
government's going through this.
729
It's very difficult to do well without, you know, cutting things that are really dear to people, especially like at a product company, big bets that are going to maybe pay off in the future, big innovations, things people are really excited about.
730
Is there any, for people trying to do this at their company, do you have any tips?
731
Like, I don't know, one or two tips to do this well, to keep morale up, to not lose sight of big opportunities in the future?
732
Anything there?
733
Yeah, I think we divested out of two big businesses, which were our self-driving unit, as well as what we call Uber Elevate, which, and we divested out of both of them during COVID.
734
COVID was a very special time for us, if I could use that term.
735
Our mobility business dropped by 80%.
736
And I think that Dara and the leadership team actually showed tremendous leadership during that time.
737
And one of those was to make those calls to divest out of those businesses.
738
Now, I think an important part to remember is you could be on the quest to just drive profitability, and you may lose your sight on new growth bets, as we call them here.
739
And how do you do that?
740
So I have my framework on this, which is I think of our portfolio as concentric circles.
741
The center of that concentric circle, the core, is our core product.
742
We do 33 million trips every single day.
743
And if you think of a typical Uber trip or an Uber delivery, there is a multi-point failure possibility all the way from you opening the app to a driver accepting, doing the pickup, doing the drop-off, and you getting a receipt.
744
And then similarly, there are a number of steps on the ETH side.
745
And we obsess over making sure that that core is as flawless as possible.
746
And also, to our point about profitability, it is as efficient as possible as well.
747
So imagine taking even one cent of efficiency out of 33 million trips every day.
748
The numbers just really start to add up.
749
So you have to make sure that you're spending, you're paying a lot of attention to that.
750
As I go out and dog food, I'm dog fooding the core mostly and making sure that it is flawless in my own little way.
751
And if you're spending enough attention on that, then you get the license to expand out of that core and start to think about other growth bets.
752
By the way, this is where Uber Eats came from back in the day.
753
And on the right side, Uber Reserve, Uber for Teams, which is something I launched a couple of years ago, our focus on taxis.
754
And there are many other growth pets that are now in the billions of dollars, you know, in total.
755
That's where it came from because we are making sure that the core is being paid attention to and it's giving us the license to sort of go out of that in that concentric circle.
756
There's another area of Uber that it feels like is shifting a bit.
757
So, historically, I know a lot of people that have worked at Uber over the years, Uber has this reputation of being very data-driven, very ruthless with privatization.
758
A lot of what you've been talking about feels like the opposite of just anecdotes and experiences, empathy.
759
So, let me ask you this question: What's something that you, as a company, as a leadership team, chose to do that was not what the data was telling you to do?
760
Could be a feature, it could be a whole big bet that ended up being successful.
761
I have a few, and each of those could have gotten me fired, Lenny.
762
It was that sort of gut-based.
763
I'll give you a few of those examples.
764
When I joined, I was working on safety.
765
And safety is a big issue on the Uber platform, was a very, very big issue back in 2017.
766
We had not sort of built enough software to be able to manage safety in the physical world.
767
So, while safety in terms of incident reduction, look at the number of incidents you're having, and then you just, just like a growth hacking project, you just drive that number down, needing to do whatever you can.
768
I said, in addition to that, we also need to incorporate a lot of functionality and features and UI in the product, both on the rider's side and the driver's side, which is delivering a sentiment of safety and making sure people feel safe.
769
You know, 99.9% of our trips are totally fine from a safety perspective, but that doesn't mean that people are not concerned.
770
So, we, in addition to driving down the incidents, we also have to develop a bunch of features so that they feel safe.
771
And that actually helped a lot because we started hearing from our users that, oh, we measure something called safety sentiment, and that safety sentiment has been going up a lot.
772
So, I would say that was sort of back in the day that I drove.
773
Another crazy one was I pushed the company to work with taxis.
774
If you look at my resume, I worked at a company called Flywheel, which is a taxi app company.
775
And so, I spent three years there.
776
That's what got me into transportation or being interested in transportation, and eventually ended up at Uber.
777
And Uber and taxis have always had an issue with each other.
778
We all know the history.
779
And I was saying, no, we should actually launch with taxis.
780
Now, if you look at the data, the data will tell you that the number of taxis is going down, that the taxis are not very reliable, the taxis have antiquated software in them, the taxi drivers may not want to provide the same level of service, so on and so forth.
781
And there's a little bit of a gut feel, and I said, no, look, there are drivers who want to make money, who do not always have enough demand.
782
We have a lot of demand.
783
If we put the right incentives in place, we will be able to create a structure where we can work together productively.
784
And today in the US, I think we operate taxis in about 10 years.
785
And that is generating a pretty large amount of revenue for us.
786
And we have taxis all over the world as well.
787
So that was probably another one where the data just didn't support my gut decision.
788
And the last one I would say is: Uber for teenagers.
789
There are so many reasons to not do that, by the way.
790
You go talk to parents, they're like, I am never putting my teen in an Uber.
791
And if you talk to the risk people in the company, they're like, we are not going to put teenagers in our cars, and there's a lot of liability.
792
I happen to be the father of a 16-year-old and a 12-year-old.
793
And I can tell you that one of the biggest problems in our household is kids' transportation.
794
And I'm like, how can that not be a problem?
795
And if anyone is going to solve a transportation problem, shouldn't that be Uber?
796
And so, how can we build a product?
797
So I started with: let's just build a product that is going to solve every single one of these problems that parents have in terms of safety.
798
So we launched that two years ago.
799
It's been growing really, really well.
800
And in fact, in California, for several reasons, we had to turn the product off.
801
And I get emails every single day from parents in California about why did we have to turn that product off.
802
So I would say a lot of the growth bets that we actually make may not have the best data supporting them.
803
But as long as we understand intrinsically what the end user wants and the problems that we need to fix, I think you have to kind of go with your gut.
804
And I would say, when it comes to transportation, we still have not solved a lot of problems that people have.
805
And so that's all headroom for us.
806
They just know exactly how to get places.
807
They're so like, they're like very knowledgeable.
808
And they just get you done.
809
It's not like the most pleasant experience, but they're very good at what they do.
810
And so I think it makes so much sense to integrate it.
811
It reminds me also, my wife always jokes: there's all these startups that come in, disrupt the whole industry, like Airbnb is another example.
812
And then they end up just kind of providing the same service.
813
Okay, cool.
814
Now we got taxis again.
815
Here we go.
816
Exactly.
817
They're very efficient.
818
They know the city like the back of their hand.
819
Yeah, especially in the UK, their whole knowledge thing.
820
Okay, I'm going to take us to a couple of recurring segments on this podcast.
821
The first is AI Corner.
822
Is there some way you've figured out how to use AI in your work, some AI tool to help you work better, to help you work faster, to get better work done?
823
I would say the team is using a lot of tools now.
824
The team is using tools to build initial prototypes, initial mocks, I should say.
825
The team is using that for user research to be able to process information as well.
826
What are some of the tools, if you can name them?
827
We're using both ChatGPT as well as Gemini quite heavily in the company.
828
We have close relationships with both the companies.
829
Specifically, I end up using ChatGPT a lot for summarization of documents.
830
That's one thing.
831
I mean, all of us have too much to read and we don't have enough time.
832
I've not used Notebook LM yet.
833
I know a lot of people who have started using it, and that is the next thing that I'm going to use.
834
Just to be able to build an audio podcast based on a bunch of information that you can consume, I think that's awesome.
835
What I've been doing is.
836
Some of these reports are 50 to 100 pages long.
837
I will never have the time to read them.
838
That's really making me much, much better acquainted with, well, this is what riders in South Africa feel, and this is what's happening in Brazil.
839
This is what's happening in Korea.
840
So that has been a huge enabler.
841
The second thing that I have really, really started liking is the deep research feature.
842
The deep research feature in, again, both Gemini as well as ChatGPT, where you feed them a prompt.
843
You actually present a pretty hard.
844
The other day, we were thinking of a driver feature.
845
It's a driver feature that has been discussed a lot in the past.
846
We still don't, we haven't done it.
847
I just asked ChatGPT, Deep Research: here's the feature.
848
This is how it would work.
849
Can you let me know if drivers will like it or not like it?
850
Is there anything we can change about that feature for the drivers to like it?
851
And it presented me an answer, which I would say it's an amazing research assistant.
852
And it's absolutely a starting point for a brainstorm with my team with some really, really good ideas.
853
So I think that that is making us not just more productive, I think it's actually going to make us better at our jobs.
854
That is an incredible use case.
855
Essentially, it's a thought partner on strategy and helping you find gaps in your thinking.
856
And I think for Uber, it's easier because these crawlers can learn a lot about what Uber is.
857
For some products, they won't know as much.
858
But clearly, there's something you could do there, whatever your product is.
859
And by the way, it's cool that you guys give access to ChatGPT.
860
A lot of companies don't.
861
Look, a lot of companies only have Gemini here, something like that.
862
Okay.
863
And what fail corner is about is people come on this podcast, they share all these wins.
864
Cool, taxis worked, and teens worked, and safety worked, and Laylas, we got profitable.
865
Everything's just going great all the time.
866
But in reality, that's not how it goes.
867
Is there a story you could share where something went wrong, something didn't work out the way you expected in your career, and what you learned from that?
868
I still somehow, when I think about it, I don't end up calling it a fail.
869
But absolutely, you know, you could call it a fail because the product didn't work or the business didn't work and so on.
870
I was at Palm a long time ago.
871
Palm, you know, developed a Palm pilot and then it went into the phone business.
872
Some of your listeners may have used them.
873
Some of your listeners may be too young to remember.
874
And then there was a period of time where it was really BlackBerry and Palm were the sort of the two smartphones on the market, especially here in the US.
875
And then Apple announced the iPhone, and then soon thereafter, Android was announced by Google.
876
And it took us a long time to respond to that.
877
It took us maybe three, four years to respond to that.
878
And in the end, you know, HP bought Palm.
879
We did not have the level of scale or the level of hardware quality that we needed to have to be able to effectively compete with the likes of Apple.
880
When you are going through the motions, when you are actually in the moment, you don't always realize what's going to happen.
881
You also think that, oh, we will be able to recover and we will be able to compete.
882
But I think there are many, many things that I learned from that.
883
And I always keep.
884
In consumer markets, if you are player number three or player number four, it's a little hard because the two top players are going to compete with each other so ferociously that it's, especially if they are scale players like Apple and Google, it's difficult for number three and number four to be able to keep up with that unless you have a very, very unique angle.
885
So, and the way I use that now is: I am, Lenny, always paranoid about the number three or the number four player or the number two player who may have an innovative idea, who may try a different strategy, who may try a different go-to-market.
886
I just never take the status scope for granted.
887
So, that's sort of one learning.
888
And I think the second learning is speed and hustle and resilience.
889
After Palm, I spent time at a couple of startups.
890
I mentioned Flywheel, which was a taxi company, which is also not able to scale.
891
But what I learned through that period is that hustle and sense of urgency is extremely important.
892
So, when I think of my portfolio of skill sets right now, really, that's portfolio that I have developed from a lot of failures over my career.
893
And those are, you know, I would say sense of urgency, because you need to move fast, because status quo can never be taken for granted.
894
And second is resilience, because times will be hard and things will be difficult, and you just have to power through them, and you have to keep building for your end users through that, and the times will change.
895
So, I would say those are the things that I've learned, and those are my failures.
896
I can see where this motto of ship, ship, ship came from.
897
Sachin, is there anything else that you want to share or leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?
898
I can talk a little bit about how I think about it.
899
I think I've talked a lot about end users, but I cannot talk about end users enough.
900
So in terms of offering my unique take, which may be completely flawed, but that is my unique take, I'll offer this, which is, I don't think our relationship with our end users is reciprocal.
901
And which means when I wake up in the morning, all I'm thinking about is how can we make our products better for our end users.
902
When end users wake up in the morning, all they're thinking about is I have to do this at my job.
903
I have many complexities, many problems in my life.
904
And that's what occupies their mind all the time.
905
They're not thinking about you.
906
They're not thinking about your product as much as that may be a hit to your ego.
907
However, for those, and I'm talking about, let's say, Uber Rides, for those 15 minutes in the day when they do think about your product, that is your opportunity to absolutely dazzle them.
908
Like give them an experience that they will not forget, or it will be so seamless for them that they don't have to think about.
909
So next day when they're again going to work, they just open the Uber app just as muscle memory.
910
But do not expect their life to be centered around your product.
911
Their life is complex.
912
All of our lives are complex.
913
You're just trying to be a part of their lives.
914
You're not trying to take over their lives.
915
You never will.
916
I love this advice.
917
There's a book that I loved that is for writing.
918
And the title is a very good thing.
919
Mark Andreessen has this quote where I think it's: Everyone's time is already allocated.
920
They don't have time for your product.
921
They have stuff to do in their day.
922
And to hit that bar is very high.
923
And so I think that's a really important reminder.
924
Thank you for sharing that.
925
With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round.
926
I've got five questions for you.
927
Are you ready?
928
I am.
929
Number one, what are two or three books that you have recommended most to other people?
930
Maybe a boring answer, but these are the books I believe in.
931
I've recommended the Steve Jobs book by Walter Isaacson.
932
I have recommended the Elon Musk book.
933
I have read the Ashley Wance one fully.
934
I'm in the middle of the Walter Isaac one.
935
And I have recommended Hard Thing About Hard Things by Ben Horowitz.
936
These are the three books.
937
I think that there was a period of time in Silicon Valley, maybe 10 years ago, and maybe this is still true, when everyone wanted to be Steve Jobs.
938
And they thought that they can just recreate being Steve Jobs.
939
There was sort of this fever in the valley.
940
And the reason why you want to listen or read that book is you need to understand the context of what makes up the entire person.
941
Yes, the person part is important, but how they applied their own context to the products that they shipped and they changed the world is important because not that I or anyone else can recreate what they did or what they are doing, but take the learnings from them and see how you can apply the same principles to your context.
942
You're not going to behave the same way that they did.
943
You're not going to build products the same way that they did, but you're going to give it your absolute freaking best because that's what your end users deserve, and you're not going to compromise on that.
944
That's sort of what my takeaway is.
945
And I think that takeaway is extremely strong in the books that I talked about.
946
And the Ben Horowitz book, it goes back to my concept of resilience.
947
We have some people who have this really optimistic view of how life is in the corporate world or in the product world or in the CEO office.
948
It's not so.
949
These are lonely jobs.
950
These are hard things.
951
And how do you persist through that?
952
I felt that that book was amazing at teaching me that.
953
Amazing.
954
Okay.
955
Next question.
956
Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show?
957
My favorite recent TV show is PE Blinders.
958
Pkey Blinders is on Netflix.
959
It's based in the 1920s and now they're in the 1930s.
960
I'm on season six.
961
It's an Irish family that's in a town called Birmingham and they go through all these years and they do all sorts of bad things.
962
But again, it's an amazing story.
963
So I highly recommend watching it.
964
I started watching it, but I didn't stay with it.
965
So maybe I got to revisit it.
966
Do you have a favorite product that you have recently discovered that you really like?
967
It is the product that makes me or evokes that emotion in me right now is deep research from ChatGPT.
968
Because I've never had a research assistant, and I keep going back to that research assistant, and I think it's an excellent product.
969
I'm sure it will improve further, but that would be my favorite product.
970
My recent do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to in work or in life?
971
Yes, and my kids are sick and tired of hearing this from me now.
972
You have input metrics in life and in work, and you have output metrics.
973
You can't really control the output metrics.
974
All you can control is inputs.
975
Whether you're trying to lose weight, whether you are trying to get grades or become very good at high school sports, or you're trying to ship a great product, or you're trying to improve retention or churn or whatever, you can only control the inputs, so focus on the inputs.
976
I love that your kids are sick of that.
977
I wonder what context you use with your kids.
978
But anyway, final question.
979
You shared a really good tip for how to not annoy an Uber driver.
980
What about, as a food delivery person, what can a customer of Eats do to avoid pissing off a delivery, a courier?
981
If they're delivering food to your home at night, turn the porch light on.
982
Because they've just driven in the dark.
983
They don't know your house.
984
They're trying really, really hard to find your house.
985
And after that, they turn the flashlight on on their phone and they're trying to find the door where they can place the food.
986
Just turn the light on.
987
That makes sense.
988
I'm super guilty of forgetting that sometimes.
989
And, you know, they also don't want to be shot by someone thinking they're sneaking around.
990
Sachin, this was incredible.
991
Two final questions.
992
Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, follow up on anything?
993
And how can listeners be useful to you?
994
Send me a message on LinkedIn.
995
I will say that I've been guilty of not establishing an online presence and writing.
996
Life and work have just taken over.
997
I need to do a better job.
998
Maybe your blog will, you know, or your podcast will really help me with that.
999
And how can listeners be useful to you?
1000
Well, back to my dog fooding theme.
1001
Send me feedback.
1002
Send me feedback.
1003
Hopefully everyone is an Uber user, whether it's Rides or whether it's EADS.
1004
Send me feedback of how we can get better as a product.
1005
And the more detailed your feedback, the better it is.
1006
It's very easy to say this doesn't work or that doesn't work.
1007
But if you actually describe and say, hey, this is what happened.
1008
I was doing this.
1009
And then this happened.
1010
This didn't make sense.
1011
This is how you can change it.
1012
I think that'll be extremely valuable to me.
1013
Only 40-page reports accepted.
1014
Just kidding.
1015
Sachin, thank you so much for being here.
1016
Thank you, Lenny.
