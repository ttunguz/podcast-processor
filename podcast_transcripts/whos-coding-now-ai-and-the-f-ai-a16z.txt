**1. What is the "narrow waste" of the internet analogy, and how does it relate to AI?**
The "narrow waste" analogy suggests that the internet is a highly fragmented and inefficient system, which is similar to the way that AI models are designed and trained. Just like the internet has a narrow range of protocols and standards that allow different devices and systems to communicate with each other, AI models are often trained using specific formats and constraints. This can make it difficult for them to transfer to different platforms and tools.
**2. Do AI models need a "narrow waste"?**
While AI models can be quite complex, they do not need to be as tightly constrained as the systems they are designed for. This is because AI models are not limited by the same technical limitations as human programmers. They can be trained on a wider range of data and can be designed to be more efficient and scalable.
**3. How can we design AI models in a way that is more compatible with the "narrow waste" of the internet?**
One approach is to use a hybrid approach that combines traditional coding with machine learning techniques. This can allow AI models to leverage the strengths of both approaches, such as the efficiency of machine learning and the flexibility of traditional coding. Another approach is to focus on designing AI models that are designed to be "fragile" or "resilient." This means that they can handle errors and exceptions gracefully, and they can continue to operate even when faced with unexpected data.
**4. What is the difference between vibe coding and enterprise software development?**
Vibe coding is a more open-ended and flexible approach to AI development that focuses on using natural language descriptions to guide the model's behavior. Enterprise software development is a more structured and disciplined approach that focuses on using formal specifications and constraints to define the model's behavior.
