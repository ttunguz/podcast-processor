1
The most difficult thing in business is first getting yourself to thinking and then getting others to thinking.
2
A person may keep very busy indeed without doing any thinking at all.
3
And the easy course is to keep so busy there will be no time left over for thought.
4
We try to substitute discussion for thought by organizing committees, but a committee is just an elaborate means of fooling oneself into believing that talking is the same as thinking.
5
These words are from Harvey S.
6
Firestone's autobiography, Men and Rubber, one of the books that I give away the most frequently as a gift.
7
While it was written in 1926, everyone I give it to is surprised not only by the density of wisdom, but by how relevant it remains today.
8
Welcome to the Knowledge Project.
9
I'm your host, Shane Parrish.
10
In a world where knowledge is power, this podcast is your toolkit for mastering the best of what other people have already figured out.
11
In 1920, Harvey Firestone returned from vacation to find his company drowning in 43 million of debt.
12
His executives were paralyzed, the banks had cut him off, competitors were circling.
13
Yet, instead of panicking, Firestone did something that shocked everyone.
14
He slashed prices by 25% and personally took control of sales.
15
The situation did not frighten me, he later wrote.
16
It put new life into me.
17
That crisis revealed the principles that separated Firestone from every other businessman of his era.
18
And they're the same principles that separate outliers from everyone else today.
19
While others built elaborate organizations, Firestone asked two simple questions that cut through every problem.
20
Is it necessary?
21
And can it be simplified?
22
While others avoided hard decisions, he had the courage to close doors and burn boats.
23
Most importantly, Firestone understood something that eludes most ambitious professionals today.
24
Positioning beats talent, simplicity scales better than complexity, and the person with options holds all the power.
25
Today's episode isn't about tires, it's about the durable, asymmetric advantages that create lasting success in any field.
26
Whether you're navigating technological disruption, fighting entrenched competitors, or building something from nothing, Firestone's principles will give you an unfair advantage.
27
As he put it, thought, not money, is the real business capital.
28
Let's examine how he built an empire by thinking differently.
29
It's time to listen and learn.
30
This podcast is for entertainment and informational purposes only.
31
Harvey Firestone learned his most valuable business lessons not from formal education, but from his father, Benjamin, a man he would later call the best businessman I have ever known.
32
What made Benjamin exceptional wasn't flashy success or quick profits, but a deeper understanding of what creates lasting value.
33
The test of a businessman is not whether he can make money in one or two boom years or can make money throughout one lifetime, but whether he creates something that will live and grow in money-making power after he is gone.
34
By this standard, Benjamin excelled through three principles that would later define Harvey's own approach to building an empire.
35
The first principle was maintaining a surplus.
36
Harvey wrote that his father had the rare foresight to know that a fine crop one year was more or less a fortunate accident and did not set a figure to be followed during future years.
37
Consequently, he always had plenty of stock and feed on hand.
38
This wasn't just prudent farming, it was positioning.
39
Benjamin was never a forced seller.
40
When other farmers rushed to market and sold regardless of price because they needed the money so badly, he could wait, sometimes an entire year, for better prices.
41
Having a surplus is the greatest aid to business judgment that I know, Harvey later reflected, and I bitterly know what I'm talking about, for I went through years of upbuilding without being able to accumulate a surplus.
42
The key lesson here is that if you are well positioned, be it with a surplus or margin of safety or whatever you want to call it, you control your own circumstances.
43
When you don't have that, you are controlled by them.
44
The second principle was patience in negotiation.
45
At market, Benjamin would silently survey the options, watching and listening and gathering as much information as possible before deciding, often walking away if conditions weren't favorable.
46
Never rush in on a deal, he advised.
47
Let it come to you.
48
This discipline meant Harvey couldn't recall his father ever making a significant mistake.
49
Third, and perhaps most valuable, was Benjamin's reputation for fairness.
50
He never wanted to get more than his stock was worth or to buy stock for less than it was worth, Harvey wrote.
51
The result, other farmers wouldn't sell until Benjamin did.
52
Buyers sought him out, first knowing whatever price he accepted would set the market.
53
His reputation had become a competitive advantage.
54
While other farmers remained narrowly focused on daily operations, Benjamin also maintained perspective through voracious reading, rare for farmers of that era.
55
As Harvey noted, when all a person's attention is required by the daily running of his business, he seldom sees the business in perspective.
56
He misses the new developments.
57
Young Harvey absorbed these lessons while developing his own passion for trading horses.
58
By 15, he could evaluate a horse's quality and value with remarkable precision, skills that would transfer surprisingly well to his future in the tire industry, where quality assessment and value creation were similarly crucial.
59
The lessons here are deceptively simple but incredibly powerful.
60
Good positioning eliminates forced decisions.
61
You don't need to be smarter than others to outperform them if you're better positioned.
62
Anyone looks like a genius when they're in a good position, and even the smartest person looks like an idiot when they're in a bad one.
63
Working in your business also differs from working on it.
64
One requires execution, the other, perspective.
65
And finally, fairness compounds of the four possible relationship outcomes with anyone in your life.
66
Win-win, win-lose, lose-win, lose-lose.
67
Only win-win builds lasting success.
68
After leaving the farm, Harvey's brief stint as a bookkeeper led to his first real business venture with a man named Jackson, selling flavoring extracts and patent medicines.
69
This disaster would teach him more about business fundamentals than any success could have.
70
Jackson's business model was based on a misunderstanding of cause and effect.
71
He had observed a friend named August Green grow wealthy selling a dubious cure.
72
Jackson believed he could replicate this success, but skipped the advertising costs by hiring charismatic salesmen.
73
Among these star salesmen was a character Harvey vividly remembered, a big, fine fellow with a genial presence and the gift of Gab, one of these men who could sell anything.
74
He had just one formula.
75
He just breezed in on a prospect, offered him a cigar, and then sat down and talked him to death.
76
That was salesmanship in those days.
77
Harvey joined as a junior salesman at $50 monthly, not for any sales expertise, but because he had helped with the business plan.
78
His romanticized version of the traveling salesman's life quickly collided with reality when his first territory was tiny Apple Creek, Ohio.
79
His first day proved humbling.
80
After nervously circling the town a few times, Harvey struck out at several small shops before reluctantly trying his hand at the largest shop, thinking it was the least likely to hear him out.
81
And surprisingly, it was at this shop that he made his first sale.
82
This pattern taught him a crucial insight.
83
The owners of truly successful businesses recognize and prioritize genuine opportunities, while those struggling often claimed to be too busy for new ideas.
84
But the business was on borrowed time, and the more profound lesson emerged as it unraveled.
85
The star salesman focused on high-margin patent medicines, while Harvey, lacking confidence, sold humble vanilla extract.
86
Unexpectedly, his vanilla sales became the company's main revenue source.
87
As Harvey later explained, patent medicines do not sell on merit, for there is precious little merit in most of them.
88
Patent medicines sell.
89
People have to be made to believe that the medicines do good.
90
Meanwhile, the extracts did not need to be advertised because people do not have to be educated into the belief that vanilla extract will give them a vanilla flavor, whereas they do have to be educated or fooled into the belief that a spring tonic will cure spring ills.
91
Within six months, all the star salesmen quit, Jackson went broke, and Harvey lost his job.
92
But he gained something more valuable than money, understanding that the relationship between product quality, marketing, and sales.
93
More importantly, he witnessed firsthand how easily businesses confuse correlation with causation.
94
The star salesmen had succeeded earlier in their careers not because of their sales techniques, but because they'd sold products with established reputations.
95
They mistook correlation, their sales alongside advertising, for causation, their personal ability to persuade.
96
Harvey would later write, The first principle of salesmanship is that you must thoroughly believe in what you have to sell.
97
Then selling becomes merely a matter of showing how your product will help a prospect.
98
Great products either sell themselves through obvious utility or require the right marketing to educate customers about their value.
99
This lesson would serve Harvey throughout his career and remains equally relevant today.
100
After his sales venture collapsed, Harvey swallowed his pride and joined his uncle's buggy company, a position he'd previously rejected.
101
For the first time, he earned enough to pursue his passion for horses as a side business, buying and selling them at a profit.
102
But technological disruption was coming for the carriage industry.
103
Harvey's company sold premium buggies for $100.
104
However, competitors began offering solid $35 alternatives that farmers found perfectly adequate.
105
Customers increasingly preferred replacing cheaper vehicles every few years rather than investing in premium durability.
106
The value proposition that seemed obviously superior to industry insiders' longer-lasting quality turned out to matter less and less to consumers than price.
107
The company soon entered receivership, and Harvey found himself unemployed again, but this time with a wife and home to support.
108
The pressure was relentless, yet these consecutive failures gave Harvey invaluable business education.
109
He was learning Jackson's X-Dar company had failed through poor marketing, misaligned incentives, and product market misunderstanding.
110
His uncle's buggy company collapsed by clinging to outdated value propositions while the market evolved beneath them.
111
Harvey was learning business fundamentals through observing failures up close, paying with time rather than capital, and it would become an education more valuable than any he could have purchased.
112
These early failures weren't just teaching Harvey about business, they were preparing his mind to spot opportunity where others saw only crisis.
113
And that opportunity would arrive in an unexpected form, right beneath the wheels of his own buggy.

124
One afternoon in Detroit, everything changed.
125
Looking down at the wheels of his own carriage, Harvey found the insight that would define his future.
126
He wrote, Driving out one afternoon in my rubber-tired buggy, it for the first time struck me that my future was right on the wheels of my buggy.
127
Those rubber tires were the only ones in Detroit.
128
They were not the only ones in the United States, and a London cab company had already fitted out all of its cabs with rubber tires.
129
But they were hard to buy in the United States.
130
Why not make them easy to buy?
131
This was classic opportunity recognition, identifying a gap between what people wanted and what was readily available.
132
Rubber tires transformed the riding experience, replacing bone-jarring wooden wheels and metal rooms with smooth comfort.
133
Harvey had experienced this himself and recognized a fundamental truth about product adoption.
134
Once a man rode on rubber tires, he wanted a set.
135
This insight mirrors what Estee Lauder would later build an entire empire around.
136
I think we talk about this in episode 218.
137
The power of direct experience.
138
Lauder insisted on personally applying her cosmetics to customers, knowing first-hand experience would convert them instantly.
139
Harvey understood that rubber tires sold themselves after just one ride, and a carefully selected partner quickly estimated the market potential during a single dinner conversation.
140
If they could capture just half the buggy market, they caught a train to Chicago and within days purchased a small rubber factory for $1,500 cash.
141
Their business model was straightforward: buy rubber strips, cut and fit them to carriage wheels, and charge $40 for sets that cost $14 to produce, a healthy 65% gross margin.
142
But they immediately confronted the entrepreneur's classic dilemma: success creating its own problems.
143
Their growth outpaced their financial resources, creating a dangerous mismatch between opportunity and capability.
144
As Harvey candidly explained, we were growing faster than our capital, which meant that we were always short of money.
145
Their promising venture now faced the constraint that kills more startups than any other, running out of cash while running towards success.
146
While Harvey mastered production quickly, the financial side of his growing business revealed his inexperience, as he candidly admitted, Their complexity was not due to the size of operations.
147
I could state our condition in those days right out of my head, and the back of an envelope gave ample space for the statement.
148
Our trouble was that we did not have enough money and did not know how to get it.
149
The elephant in the room for any growing business appeared: cash constraints meeting opportunity.
150
When the Imperial Rubber Company offered to sell their entire operation for $15,000, which was a bargain too good to ignore, Harvey faced a moment of truth.
151
He needed outside capital, therefore, he would need to learn banking.
152
His first bank meeting became a masterclass in humiliation.
153
Harvey arrived with enthusiasm and projections, mistaking the banker's polite interest for genuine excitement.
154
The banker nodded and asked questions and gave every indication of impending approval.
155
I left the bank thinking I was going to get a loan and while I was never refused the loan, I never got it.
156
Picture Harvey in that moment, walking out confident, expecting imminent funds, unaware he just revealed every gap in his financial knowledge.
157
But failure teaches what success can't.
158
From this embarrassment, Harvey extracted lessons about financial communication that still serve entrepreneurs a century later.
159
What I learned was that a bank statement ought never to be in such shape that it has to be explained.
160
Everything ought to be on the statement.
161
A statement of condition can be a prospectus.
162
In fact, it is the best possible kind of prospectus, but it ought not to be prepared in enthusiasm.
163
Undeterred, Harvey approached a larger institution, First National Bank.
164
This critical moment came when he met Frank O.
165
Wetmore, a young loan officer who saw beyond Harvey's inexperience to his potential.
166
Rather than rejecting him, Wetmore offered what Harvey called a course in practical banking, teaching him about the proper financial ratios and management.
167
Then, remarkably, Wetmore lent him $10,000.
168
The lesson here is bounce, don't break.
169
The first no is rarely the end of the line.
170
Learn, adapt, and try again.
171
Harvey's relationship with Wetmore evolved from lender to mentor, transforming both the business and Harvey himself.
172
The connection proved so valuable that even after becoming an industrial titan, Harvey continued seeking Wetmore's counsel whenever he was in Chicago.
173
With financing secured, they purchased the factory, but a competitive threat immediately emerged.
174
A rival company introduced a purpose-built wheel for rubber tires that made Harvey's retro.
175
Harvey faced the classic entrepreneur's dilemma: fight a technically superior competitor or find another path.
176
Rather than battling uphill, he pursued a counter-intuitive strategy, proposing a merger to his competitor with a simple, powerful argument: if the two of us kept in the field, neither would make any money.
177
The consolidation succeeded, therefore, they became the dominant player in Chicago's buggy tire market.
178
This market position attracted the attention of Consolidated Company, a trust actively acquiring rubber businesses nationwide.
179
After careful negotiation, Harvey and his partner sold for $1,254,000, an amount Harvey described as something more than four times what our business was worth, not counting its goodwill.
180
His personal share came to $45,000 in cash, considerably more money than I had thought was in the world for me.
181
Picture Harvey in this moment, the farm boy who weathered multiple failures, now holding more cash than he'd imagined ever possible.
182
Most people would have considered this the happy ending, goal achieved, financial security obtained, but Harvey wasn't most people.
183
In fact, he was just getting started.
184
With characteristic prudence, he invested $20,000 in a mortgage for steady income and kept $25,000 liquid for his next venture.
185
In just four years, a $1,000 investment had grown 45-fold.
186
Though the acquiring company offered him a position, Harvey soon resigned.
187
As he put it, I wanted to be out for myself.
188
The wealth hadn't changed his fundamental desire for independence and the chance to build something truly his own.
189
With newfound wealth in hand, Harvey faced the classic entrepreneur's question: what's next?
190
The carriage industry held little appeal for his uncle's business collapsed.
191
But what about the emerging automobile industry?
192
Surprisingly, Harvey didn't see gasoline-powered cars as the obvious future.
193
The few automobiles on the American road seemed like expensive curiosities, not exactly toys, but certainly not commercial products.
194
Of course, that's how all innovation starts.
195
Just look at AI today.
196
It really went mainstream with DALI.
197
And all you could do was make these silly little images.
198
And people laughed.
199
And now, just a few years later, it's taking over jobs.
200
Harvey, like many of us, was so focused on the present that he'd walked past the automotive history being made without recognizing it.
201
He later admitted, I do not recall ever seeing Henry Ford's car about the streets of Detroit.
202
And I have no recollection of having seen Mr.
203
Ford, although probably we passed many times on the street.
204
For the Detroit Edison company where he worked was close to my Detroit office.
205
Instead, Harvey believed electric vehicles would dominate, noting, I had sold many tires to the Woods Motor Vehicle Company in Chicago, which was one of the first companies to get out an electric carriage.
206
We all thought of electricity as the coming mode of power for everything.
207
The man who would later partner with Henry Ford was betting on the wrong technology, but amid this uncertainty, Harvey made a profound insight that would define his success.
208
Rather than betting on which transportation technology would win, he'd bet on what wouldn't change.
209
I believed thoroughly in rubber tires, he wrote.
210
They made riding so much easier that they appeared to me to be a necessity.
211
While working briefly for a Chicago tire company, Harvey grew dissatisfied with their pricing policies.
212
When disagreements with bankers over factory locations derailed his plan, Harvey redirected to Akron, Ohio, the established center of America's rubber industry.
213
There, after managing a tire department for another company, Harvey encountered the invention that would transform his trajectory and the future of American transportation.
214
In Akron, Harvey encountered an invention that addressed the tire industry's fundamental challenge.
215
James Swinehart, a former school teacher turned carpenter, had developed an innovative fastening method that solved a persistent problem.
216
The prime difficulty in the whole tire trade was fastening the tires to the rims, Harvey explained.
217
The clincher principle was popular for a time, but it was not entirely satisfactory.
218
Swinehart's solution used crosswires embedded in the tire base, secured with retaining wires, a simple but elegant fix that worked particularly well for larger tires where other approaches failed completely.
219
On July 26, 1900, Harvey and Swinehart struck a deal.
220
They would launch with $50,000 in capital, Harvey investing $10,000 cash plus a business option valued at $15,000, while Sweinhart contributed $10,000 and his patent.
221
The Firestone Tire and Rubber Company was born.
222
Harvey became treasurer and general manager rather than president, explaining, I have never cared much about titles.
223
It did not bother me who had the title so long as I ran the company.
224
This focus on substance over status would define his leadership style.
225
The established Akron rubber companies barely noticed this upstart, but their indifference created opportunity.
226
For two years, Firestone operated as a middleman, buying tires.
227
Sales grew rapidly, but profits remained elusive.
228
Losing money is not pleasant, but every business must at times lose money.
229
Losing money is really serious if you do not know why you are losing or if you do know why and cannot help yourself.
230
It was very plain to me why we were losing money.
231
We were losing money because we couldn't control the cost of our tires, Harvey realized.
232
They had the best fastening device, but couldn't price competitively while buying tires from the very companies they competed against.
233
The solution was clear but daunting.
234
Vertical integration.
235
They needed their own manufacturing facility, therefore they needed more capital again.
236
Harvey knew this fundraising round would determine their fate.
237
Instead of approaching many small investors, he targeted Will Christie, the most influential man in Akron, applying a principle he'd refined through experience.
238
A great many salesmen make the mistake of thinking that pestering a man is the same as selling him, and they get their prospects into such a state of exasperation that they would not buy a gold dollar from them at 50% off.
239
Just getting to a man is not enough.
240
It is when and how you get to him.
241
Harvey tracked Christie's vacation plans, boarded a train to California, checked into the same hotel, and then, quite accidentally, bumped into him at breakfast.
242
The staged coincidence worked perfectly.
243
By the meal's end, Harvey had secured $10,000 in investment, which eventually grew to $50,000 with Christie becoming company president.
244
With funding secured, Harvey found an abandoned foundry and furnished it frugally.
245
We bought everything at the second-hand price.
246
You might almost say that we furnished the factory with junk, but it was junk which, with repairs, served our purpose very well.
247
Harvey embodied the hands-on founder, simultaneously serving as factory superintendent, office manager, and head of sales.
248
By 1903, sales reached $230,000, more than double their previous year.
249
But the five-second moment that validated their strategy came with the balance sheet, their first ever profit of $8,503.
250
Despite this long-awaited success, Harvey refused to declare dividends, choosing instead to reinforce their financial position.
251
We wanted to save as much as possible for a still further enlargement of the factory.
252
The lesson here is instructive.
253
While many companies would have taken the surplus and declared a dividend, Harvey wanted to position the company for the future.
254
The cycle of financial discipline begun on Benjamin Firestone's farm was now powering the early stages of what would become an industrial empire.
255
Success brought its own challenges.
256
As manufacturers rather than resellers, they faced hostility from established rubber companies who had once welcomed them as customers, but now viewed them as direct competitors.
257
Harvey confronted a classic business dilemma: will you cut your quality, reduce prices, and meet competition, or will you try to sell at your present price?
258
Either obvious approach meant certain failure.
259
Lower prices would erase their hard-won profitability, but they lacked the scale economies to compete at the same price point as industry giants.
260
They needed a third option.
261
Therefore, innovation became their only path forward.
262
Harvey understood a fundamental business truth.
263
There is no real profit in high prices because high prices automatically cut down volume.
264
But the only possible way to lower prices and still keep business is to save in the cost of manufacturing by improved processes.
265
The opportunity lurked in a problem hiding in plain sight.
266
The carriage tire trade lacked standardization, forcing dealers to stock hundreds of tire sizes, a massive inventory burden consuming both space and capital.
267
What if they could create a standardized product that solved this inventory nightmare?
268
George Luddington, a Firestone employee, proposed creating tires in continuous lengths that could be cut to size as needed.
269
The concept was elegantly simple, but technically challenging.
270
All previous attempts had failed during the rubber curing process.
271
Rather than dismissing the idea, Harvey partnered directly with Ludington, working alongside him to solve the problem.
272
This wasn't an executive dictating from above, but a problem solver in the trenches.
273
The resulting roll tire transformed the industry.
274
Dealers could serve customers with a fraction of previous inventory, and Firestone escaped the price war trap.
275
As Harvey noted with understated pride, that invention took us completely out of competition.
276
This focus on solving genuine problems extended beyond product innovation to customer relationships.
277
When Cuban distributor Jose Alvarez complained about defective tires and refused payment, Harvey didn't argue by mail.
278
He sent his representative to Havana immediately with new equipment.
279
Karkhuff, the Firestone representative, discovered the true issue: incorrectly mounted tires due to misunderstood instructions.
280
After proper installation, Alvarez insisted on testing the tires himself.
281
Imagine this.
282
Alvarez hitches his best horses to a carriage with Karkuff trembling beside him, then drives wildly through Havana, turning out of car tracks at full speed and dashing around corners on two wheels like a madman.
283
This dramatic demonstration.
284
Alvarez not only paid in full but requested an exclusive representation contract, becoming Firestone's largest single customer for years.
285
The lesson is powerful.
286
Solving problems at their source builds trust that advertising dollars can't buy.
287
While the customer was wrong, Firestone sent solutions instead of arguments.
288
The relationship became so solid that when competitors later tried selling similar tires in Cuba without a license, Alvarez reportedly had them jailed until they agreed to stop.
289
By refusing the false choice between competing on price or premium positioning, Harvey created his own category through innovation, a strategy that would repeatedly save the company in the decades ahead.
290
While Firestone was thriving with solid rubber tires, a technological revolution loomed ahead.
291
Gasoline-powered automobiles required pneumatic tires, air-filled cushions that fundamentally differed from the solid tires that had built Firestone's company to date.
292
Even worse, this new technology was controlled by an entrenched monopoly hostile to newcomers.
293
Harvey faced the innovator's dilemma in its purest form.
294
The numbers told a compelling story of success.
295
1904 sales had doubled to $460,000, while profits surged nearly ninefold to $71,000.
296
Everything pointed to doubling down on what was working.
297
But Harvey looked beyond the present numbers to future trends.
298
If I read the signs correctly, solid tires would soon be a minor product.
299
Most executives would celebrate their success and expand their profitable solid tire business.
300
Harvey instead wrote, No business can succeed unless it is constantly revising its product, not only to meet the actual demands of today, but also the potential demands of tomorrow.
301
This vision triggered internal conflicts so severe that one major shareholder disagreed so vehemently that Harvey bought out his stock entirely.
302
The future belonged to pneumatic tires, therefore the company needed to adapt despite knowing nothing about manufacturing them.
303
In addition, the vehicle tire industry operated as a closed cartel.
304
The GNJ Clincher Tire Association controlled the basic patent and ran a rigid monopoly dictating who could manufacture tires, imposing production quotas, and fixing prices across the entire industry.
305
Each licensed manufacturer received a designated market percentage with excess profits surrendered back to the pool.
306
As Harvey noted, if these patents held, it would have kept the motor industry in the pleasure and sporting class until the monopoly had run its course.
307
The new age of transport would have been delayed.
308
When Harvey approached the association for a license, they flatly refused.
309
They didn't want another competitor diluting their shares.
310
True to form, Harvey bounced but didn't break.
311
He began searching for an alternative method of fastening pneumatic tires to rims that wouldn't violate the clincher patent.
312
He discovered a crude but promising approach, essentially what would become the straight-side tire of today with rim flanges bolted together.
313
As Harvey reflected, it is a curious coincidence that both the sidewire solid tire and the straight-side pneumatic tire proved to be the only methods for fastening on the heavy tires that were to come.
314
But I was forced as an outsider into both of them.
315
His observation contains a crucial lesson for entrepreneurs and innovators.
316
There is always a better way of doing everything than the way which is standard at the moment.
317
It is a good thing.
318
Starting with nothing, Harvey hired a single pneumatic tire maker, tucked him into a corner of their shop, and began hand-building tires.
319
With no automobile to test them on, he purchased one from New York and had it shipped to Ohio.
320
There, they retrofitted the wheels with custom rims and flanges, a process filled with unanticipated obstacles.
321
Their first road test became an exercise in perseverance.
322
Setting out for Harvey's childhood home 60 miles away, what should have been a few hours' journey stretched into seven hours of frustration.
323
Every few feet, at least that is how it now seems, we had a blowout, he recalled.
324
Seven hours of repeated failure would discourage most entrepreneurs, but Harvey spent a full year refining both tires and rims until they worked properly.
325
Then came an even greater barrier.
326
Every automobile in America had been fitted for clincher tires.
327
To sell even one set of straight-side tires, Firestone would need to convince automobile owners that his product justified completely changing their vehicle's rims, dramatically increasing the price while locking them into Firestone as their only tire supplier.
328
It was the definition of a hard sell, more expensive, riskier, and requiring commitment to an unproven product.
329
The question hung in the air: how could a small company with a non-standard product possibly break through?
330
Just when Firestone's vehicle tire initiative seemed destined to remain a small experiment, opportunity arrived unexpectedly.
331
In 1905, Harvey learned that Henry Ford planned to build 2,000 cars priced at $500 each, vehicles meant for ordinary Americans, not just wealthy enthusiasts.
332
If these cars shipped with Firestone's straight-side rims instead of clincher rims, Harvey would have a good time.
333
They'd come equipped from the factory.
334
Realizing this, Harvey immediately traveled to Detroit.
335
The Clincher tire monopoly had quoted Ford $70 per set.
336
Therefore, Firestone offered $55, still enough for a healthy profit, but a significant saving for Ford's cost-sensitive manufacturing.
337
This first meeting between these future industrial titans revealed their shared outsider status.
338
Ford battled patents monopolizing automobile manufacturing while Firestone fought the Clincher Tire Association.
339
Both men believed in making their products accessible to average Americans, not just the wealthy.
340
If your tire proves to be what you think it is, then we'll use it, said Ford.
341
But true to his meticulous nature, he insisted on 60 days of rigorous road testing before accepting.
342
The tires passed Ford's demanding tests.
343
Harvey got an order for 2,000 sets, a potential breakthrough moment, but elation quickly gave way to panic.
344
His pneumatic tire department consisted of exactly one person, and they had made only a few tires.
345
Now they needed to rapidly scale up.
346
Harvey now faced organizing an entire production division, sourcing materials, manufacturing rims, and financing this operation overnight.
347
He borrowed $5,000 to start, but immediately hit obstacles.
348
The handmade rim flanges used in testing proved too expensive and weak for mass production.
349
The local company contracted to produce them, quoted $20 per set, but couldn't meet quality standards.
350
Harvey scrambled to find another manufacturer who could deliver superior rims at prices that preserved their profit margins.
351
Just as production momentum built, disaster struck.
352
After completing 300 tires representing over $10,000 in borrowed money, Ford announced the new model would be delayed for months.
353
With commitments for tire parts already totaling another $25,000, Firestone faced financial catastrophe.
354
They needed cash from the initial deliveries to repay what they'd already spent.
355
Though the company's 1905 profits reached $122,000, their rapidly expanding business demanded every dollar be reinvested.
356
Sales had doubled to $770,000, and their workforce had grown from 12 to 130 employees.
357
As Harvey explained with characteristic candor, our profits were book profits, not cash profits.
358
The Ford partnership that seemed like salvation now threatened to sink the company before it could deliver a single tire.
359
With the Ford order delayed and cash dwindling, Harvey walked the financial tightrope.
360
He renewed notes, sold additional stock, and managed cash flow with surgical precision, all while facing skepticism from bankers who viewed automobiles as a passing novelty.
361
Ironically, this banking skepticism proved beneficial in the long run.
362
It is a fortunate thing for the industry that it was not favored by the bankers, Harvey reflected, else it would have been financed by bond issues, and there have been several periods when these bond issues might have been foreclosed, which would have set back the industry for a number of years.
363
The automotive revolution would be built not on debt, but on the audacity of entrepreneurs willing to stake everything on their vision.
364
When Ford finally began taking deliveries in 1906, the tires exceeded expectations.
365
Large, tough, and durable.
366
This established a partnership that would shape both companies for decades.
367
As Harvey noted, working with Ford provided steady pressure for higher service and lower prices that prevented complacency.
368
Anyone who does business with Mr.
369
Ford never gets a chance to rest and enjoy honors.
370
The pressure for better methods is continuous.
371
Success revealed yet another challenge.
372
Ford customers could only use Firestone's straight-side tires, but Firestone lacked nationwide distribution.
373
People hesitated to buy cars that might not have replacement tires available when needed.
374
Ford delivered a clear ultimatum.
375
Firestone would need to make standard clincher tires as well.
376
Harvey reluctantly returned to the tire monopoly, renewing his license application.
377
The association president once again politely declined.
378
The moment stretched into silence as Harvey considered his options.
379
Then, with quiet determination, if you will not give me a license, then I will go right ahead and make clincher tires without a license.
380
And that's exactly what he did.
381
Facing inevitable legal battle against the tire monopoly, Harvey wrote, I was mentally, if not financially, prepared for a long fight.
382
He took inspiration from Ford's ongoing battle against the Selden patent, a sweeping claim that essentially demanded royalties on all gasoline-powered automobiles.
383
When the Selden group threatened to prosecute every Ford car owner for patent violation, Ford boldly offered indemnity bonds to each customer.
384
Hardly anyone requested them, confirming what Harvey observed.
385
The public always roots for the underdog.
386
Ford eventually won his case on appeal, famously testifying that George Selden has never advanced the automobile industry in a single particular, and it would perhaps be further advanced than it is now if he had never been born.
387
For Harvey, something unexpected happened.
388
The legal notice he braced for never arrived.
389
The Clincher Tire Association had become distracted by another infringement case, one they ultimately lost when the courts declared their patent invalid.
390
Their monopoly collapsed overnight, freeing the entire industry.
391
Though, as Harvey wryly noted, another monopoly was shortly to take its place.
392
The birth of transformative industries often follows this pattern.
393
Pioneers create genuine innovations, then opportunists build legal barriers around them, protecting incumbents.
394
Edison and Ford, both friends of Harvey, believed that inventors rarely benefited from patent laws.
395
The real profits, they argued, flowed to capitalists who controlled the legal machinery.
396
Yet inventors like James Dyson in episode 220 demonstrate why some protection remains essential.
397
Without it, what incentive exists to invest years perfecting a breakthrough?
398
This tension between monopolistic control that stifles progress and legitimate protection that rewards innovation remains unresolved a century later.
399
The story's irony is that Harvey, forced outside the patent system, created superior alternatives that might otherwise never have existed.
400
Sometimes the greatest innovation happens not because of the system, but despite it.
401
1906 marked a turning point for Firestone.
402
With Ford as their largest customer, sales hit the million-dollar mark, but as always, success brought complications.
403
Despite this milestone, profits actually declined slightly from the previous year, and shareholders who had patiently waited began demanding dividends.
404
Harvey was left with a choice between satisfying investors and the long term.
405
He crafted a careful compromise, issuing $100,000 in additional stock and declaring modest dividends that preserved cash while placating early investors.
406
This balancing act revealed Harvey's fundamental philosophy about ownership.
407
I then and always have regarded the stock of our company as something to buy and hold and not something to speculate in.
408
The moment that officers or directors of a company begin to speculate in its stock, the ruin of the company is not far away, for it is impossible to serve both the company and the stock market.
409
As the industry matured, Harvey observed a subtle but profound shift.
410
Fewer people were in the automobile game and more in the automobile business.
411
What had started as a novelty for enthusiasts was becoming an essential tool of modern life, driven largely by Ford's increasingly affordable models.
412
But tire manufacturing remained surprisingly primitive.
413
It was still more art than science.
414
No company could guarantee specific mileage because none had mastered consistent quality.
415
Production relied on rule of thumb methods rather than scientific principles.
416
Even the raw materials were wildly inconsistent, with rubber from Brazil varying dramatically between shipments.
417
Harvey realized that to grow beyond their current position, Firestone needed to transform tire making from craft to science.
418
This meant establishing something most smaller manufacturers considered a luxury, a laboratory.
419
I did not know how really important a laboratory was, he admitted, and already having four or five places for every dollar that came in, I had no inclination to look for new ways of spending money.
420
Nevertheless, he started modeling.
421
This humble beginning opened Harvey's eyes to what science and manufacturing means, and the lab gradually evolved into a powerful technical center.
422
Years later, he would declare, I would almost as soon try to make tires without rubber as to try to make them without a chemist.
423
The pattern continued when another industry cartel, the United Rim Company, refused to work with Firestone.
424
Rather than capitulating, Harvey launched his own Rim manufacturing division.
425
When denied access to established groups, he consistently created alternatives that proved superior.
426
I wanted to keep out of all price-fixing or royalty combinations, he explained.
427
They did not impress me as being good business.
428
Was this moral stance genuine or merely the rationalization of an outsider?
429
The evidence suggests both Harvey and Henry Ford shared a fundamental business philosophy: high volume at low prices.
430
Their vision of making automobiles available to everyone through mass production wasn't just rhetoric, it shaped their operational decisions daily.
431
The Hoover Dam wasn't built in a day, and the GMC Sierra lineup wasn't built overnight.
432
Like every American achievement, building the Sierra 1500 heavy-duty and EV was the result of dedication, a dedication to mastering the art of engineering.
433
That's what this country has done for 250 years, and what GMC has done for over 100.

443
When he approached his bank for additional credit against his established $60,000 line, they not only refused, but they demanded he reduce his $20,000 note by at least $5,000 when it came due in November.
444
At that moment, with the entire financial system seizing out, most companies either froze in panic or desperately sought concessions.
445
Harvey took a different approach.
446
When a carload of rubber arrived in Akron with payment due, he simply told the truth to his supplier.
447
He couldn't pay immediately.
448
The response revealed how universal the crisis was.
449
Unload it and use it and pay for it when you can.
450
We're all in the same boat.
451
Then came the defining moment.
452
When his bank note came due, Firestone didn't just reduce it as requested.
453
He paid it in full and immediately closed his account.
454
It was a bold statement of independence from a bank that had shown little faith during difficult times.
455
Firestone understood a key lesson.
456
A good partner reveals themselves more in the bad times than the good times.
457
The panic subsided almost as quickly as it erupted.
458
And as Harvey noted with characteristic understatement, it left us in better condition than we ever were.
459
By 1910, sales had soared to $5 million with profits exceeding $1.3 million.
460
What's instructive here is how Firestone positioned himself before the crisis struck.
461
He wasn't predicting how the future would play out.
462
He was just positioning for multiple possible futures.
463
While others scrambled for survival during the panic, Harvey had maintained sufficient reserves to not only weather the storm, but capitalize on it.
464
His father's lesson about keeping a surplus proved crucial once again.
465
Positioning is leverage.
466
Rockefeller said, the best feed during the depressions.
467
By 1910, Firestone Tire Company had exploded from 12 employees to 1,000 in just eight years.
468
This growth created a management challenge that forced Harvey to confront a fundamental question.
469
How could he maintain control without becoming a bottleneck?
470
The business, he wrote, was already too large for me to look after alone.
471
And yet, I did not believe, and I never have believed in what's called delegation, he reflected.
472
His leadership philosophy was refreshingly direct.
473
If anything in the business is wrong, the fault is squarely with management.
474
The fault is mine.
475
That is my conception of business.
476
This is the OG founder's mode.
477
Harvey's management style remained stubbornly focused on simplicity.
478
He tackled one task at a time and avoided hasty decisions.
479
Rather than writing memos, he called people directly or spoke to them by phone, noting that the writing of letters can be a great time waster.
480
One can only imagine what he'd say about today's email culture.
481
Even his approach to financial planning resisted unnecessary complexity.
482
While maintaining an official 12-month budget for the board, he recognized its limitations.
483
If it were possible to plan for a year ahead, then there would be no need for judgment or management.
484
Any question that came up could be settled by referring to the plan.
485
Instead, he operated on a four-month cycle that aligned with rubber purchasing periods.
486
This skepticism towards rigid planning reflected his deeper desire to separate fact from fiction.
487
I want to know when I am guessing and when I'm dealing with facts.
488
But Harvey's most transformative contribution came.
489
Is it necessary and can it be simplified?
490
These questions revealed that many established practices were merely traditions masquerading as requirements.
491
Consider the industry-wide belief that rubber required lengthy aging in warehouses before use.
492
When Harvey questioned this expensive and time-consuming practice, no one could explain why it was necessary.
493
He suggested bypassing it as an experiment.
494
The results, the unaged tires, performed just as well, saving the company millions of dollars.
495
Someone back in the past must have laid down the rule that rubber had to age, he observed, and everyone else had followed it without question.
496
This relentless questioning transformed operations throughout the company.
497
Manufacturing turnover dropped from 60 to 15 days.
498
Defects plummeted while output increased, all while using less factory space.
499
As the company expanded nationally, Harvey initially appointed independent distributors with exclusive territories, but by 1913, he realized many distributors lacked his and Ford's vision for the automotive future.
500
Therefore, he slashed the network and established company-owned branches to directly control both product and service.
501
The growth eventually led to what seemed like an inevitable milestone, the National Sales Convention.
502
At the time of our first convention, he wrote, we could not afford to spend that money, but also we thought we could not afford not to have a convention, else our men in the field might think we were not worth working for.
503
The first modest gathering of 20 people proved genuinely valuable.
504
Distributors witnessed tire manufacturing.
505
One successful convention spawned specialized events for every type of employee with elaborate productions, photographers, fancy booklets, and what Harvey called manufactured enthusiasm.
506
This organizational bloat reached its absurd peak with Milestones, a legitimate general interest magazine featuring famous writers and expensive cover art.
507
Though it cost 20 cents per copy to produce, dealers bought it for 5 cents and circulation reached 1 million copies.
508
As Harley dryly noted, as advertising, it was worth to us exactly nothing.
509
The wake-up call came when Harvey discovered salespeople boasting about selling marketing materials rather than tires.
510
Upon learning a whole department existed solely to bill advertising materials, he asked the crucial question: Are we in the business of selling tires or are we publishers and sellers of advertising?
511
He answered by immediately killing both the magazine and the entire advertising billing department, refocusing the sales team on the core mission: selling tires.
512
What's instructive here is how growth naturally creates complexity that quietly erodes focus and takes on a life of its own.
513
Even with a leader as vigilant as Harvey, organizational bloat crept in convention upon convention, departments upon departments, costs upon costs, all seemingly reasonable in isolation, but collectively diverting resources from the core business.
514
Nobody can maintain the focus of a company like its CEO, especially the founder.
515
The remedy wasn't more sophisticated systems or additional oversight, but rather returning to the organizational inertia that transforms successful companies into bureaucratic zombies.
516
The greatest advantage often comes from not working harder within complexity, but from the clarity to recognize and eliminate it.
517
Remember, simplicity scales, fancy fails.
518
As World War I approached, the Firestone Tire Company was expanding rapidly.
519
Their factories nearly tripled in size within five years, including a facility dedicated exclusively to producing a single tire size, an early application of Harvey's simplification philosophy that mirrored Ford's own manufacturing focus.
520
When America entered World War I in 1917, production priorities shifted dramatically.
521
Nearly all output diverted to government contracts, manufacturing tires for military vehicles and trucks.
522
But this wartime pressure revealed an opportunity that would transform American transportation forever.
523
Before the war, Harvey wrote, comparatively few automobiles were used for business, and the truck had not established itself as an economical form of transportation.
524
Long hauls by trucks were unknown, excepting as stunts.
525
The war changed all that.
526
The war was fought with trucks.
527
While most saw only wartime disruption, Harvey spotted a solution to a critical infrastructure problem.
528
America's railroads had become hopelessly bottlenecked with military shipments threatening to strangle the domestic economy.
529
In 1918, with the railroads clogged with government freight, I started the ship-by-truck movement, Harvey explained.
530
His insight was simple but revolutionary.
531
Trucks could complement rail service perfectly.
532
Railroads excelled at moving large volumes over long distances, but trucks offered superior flexibility for shorter hauls where loading, unloading, and switching rail cars wasted precious time.
533
Picture America's transportation system in 1918.
534
A nation built around railroads suddenly found its arteries clogged during wartime.
535
The economy needed an alternative, and Harvey provided it through a campaign that was both visionary and pragmatic.
536
Firestone trucks emblazoned with ship-by-truck Firestone banners toured the country as moving billboards.
537
Harvey authored influential articles declaring ship-by-truck as the traffic motto of today and the future.
538
He established ship-by-truck clubs among freight operators nationwide and created early freight brokerages that connected shippers with truck owners looking for loads.
539
The timing couldn't have been more perfect.
540
Henry Ford had just introduced the Model TT in 1917, America's first mass-produced one-ton truck.
541
As Harvey drummed up demand for trucking services, Ford supplied affordable vehicles, many riding on Firestone tires.
542
Their complementary visions created a multiplier effect that transformed American logistics.
543
Registered trucks in the United States soared from 215,000 in 1916 to over 1 million by 1920.
544
What's instructive is how Harvey consistently positioned himself at the intersection of major trends.
545
Rather than just selling tires, he created entire ecosystems that expanded his market.
546
The ship-by-truck movement wasn't merely clever marketing, it was infrastructure development that benefited both the nation and Firestone's bottom line.
547
By catching the right wave of transportation evolution, Harvey transformed his company from a mere supplier into an essential catalyst for America's economic modernization.
548
Although keep in mind these words were written in the mid-1920s.
549
During 1919, we produced more than 4 million tires and made a profit of more than $9 million.
550
We could not keep up with demand.
551
The railroads remained congested, and dealers were willing to pay premiums simply to secure deliveries.
552
Prices did not matter, he noted.
553
Delivery was the thing.
554
Success masked a dangerous delusion.
555
Firestone's Akron headquarters sprouted an elaborate hierarchy, East, West, and South divisions, each with their own managers, sub-managers, and accounting departments.
556
This complexity multiplied at every branch as each location developed mini-empires of specialized assistants.
557
The sales force ballooned to a thousand people while paperwork multiplied even faster.
558
Years later, Harvey was refreshingly honest about this period.
559
I do not know where this organization bug came from, but like the flu, it hit nearly everyone in the country.
560
I am free to confess what it did to us, for it is over with, and we are immune.
561
Here's the dangerous part: all this organizational bloat seemed to be working.
562
Sales kept growing, therefore, everyone assumed their elaborate systems were brilliant and necessary.
563
Harvey later realized they would have shown as startling an increase had we abolished our whole sales force, closed all our branches and dealers, and just sent out our tires and freight cars to be thrown off on sidings and taken away by clamoring buyers.
564
They were succeeding despite their organization, not because of it.
565
The post-war boom had papered over fundamental inefficiencies that would soon be brutally exposed.
566
The prosperity of 1919 bred dangerous complacency.
567
As Harvey observed, in 1919 to 1920, the presidents and other high officers of companies began to get the idea that they needed rest and recreation and plenty of it.
568
An executive felt embarrassed if discovered within a thousand miles of his job, for of course, a good executive always delegated his duties.
569
Harvey had rented a house in England for summer 1920, but something was nagging at him.
570
Despite record profits and insatiable demand, he sensed the boom couldn't last.
571
In May, at business's peak, he gathered 800 foremen at his family farm with a prescient warning: be prepared to slow down.
572
Then he sailed for Europe anyway.
573
By this time, Firestone had accumulated massive financial exposure, $35 million in borrowed money and unprecedented long-term contracts for raw materials.
574
The word had gone around in the tire industry that the man who could get fabric would get the business, Harvey explained.
575
We had never made long contracts ahead for fabric, but that year, we made several three-year contracts, and of course, at high prices.
576
Everything was at high prices.
577
Sales held strong through June, but July brought the first cracks.
578
Inventory began accumulating while Harvey received increasingly urgent cables from Europe.
579
Sales were slowing, factories ran at full capacity, contracted materials kept arriving, and cash was evaporating.
580
Initially, Harvey stayed put, reasoning, it would be a good thing to have a little vacation before confronting the inevitable crisis.
581
But a final desperate cable forced his hand.
582
Sales had stopped completely.
583
Borrowing capacity was exhausted, and bills were coming due with no means to pay them.
584
Harvey cut short his vacation and took the next steamer home.
585
Company officers met him at the dock.
586
$43 million in debt, no willing banks, factories producing tires nobody wanted, and contracted materials arriving they couldn't pay for.
587
The executives saw no way forward.
588
It was over, or so they thought.
589
Arriving in Akron on Friday morning, Harvey surveyed the crisis and made a characteristic decision.
590
I will not tackle this job until Monday.
591
He retreated to his family homestead for solitary reflection.
592
By Saturday, his mind was clear.
593
He summoned the assistant sales manager to arrange Monday meetings with key sales personnel.
594
Their reports were unanimous.
595
There is no business.
596
The dealers are not only stocked, but also demoralized and will not buy.
597
Without hesitation, Harvey took direct control, telling the sales manager to take a vacation while he personally ran the department.
598
Here's where most executives would have panicked, but Harvey found the crisis energizing.
599
The situation did not frighten me.
600
It put new life into me.
601
I saw the opportunity to do more business than we had ever done.
602
His diagnosis was simple.
603
The public still needed tires, but they are not going to buy at present prices.
604
His solution shocked everyone, slashed prices by 25% across the board.
605
We are in the business of making and selling tires.
606
The factory here is piled to the roof with unsold tires.
607
All the branches are full of tires, and so are all your dealers.
608
Our tires have to be turned into cash.
609
His sales team couldn't comprehend such drastic action.
610
Some argued for modest 10 to 15% reductions.
611
Harvey stood firm, not revealing he'd actually considered cutting prices by 33 and 1/3%.
612
A small reduction would not give the smash we had to have.
613
The big dramatic play.
614
Those who couldn't embrace the strategy had to be let out.
615
This was no time for half-hearted work.
616
Implementation matched the strategy's boldness.
617
Harvey personally addressed dealer meetings nationwide.
618
The company bought full-page newspaper ads and hung enormous red banners proclaiming Firestone tires 25% discount on dealer shops across America.
619
It was a fire sale for the first time in our history.
620
We thrust aside all our dignity and customs.
621
We plastered the country with our slogan.
622
Competitors initially held their prices, giving Firestone crucial market exclusivity.
623
Our competitors fought us for about a month, as I thought they would.
624
Then they trailed after us with cuts, but I only needed that month's start.
625
The gamble worked brilliantly.
626
In September and October 1920 alone, Firestone sold $18 million worth of tires and reduced debt from nearly $44 million to just over $31 million.
627
What's instructive here is Harvey's counterintuitive response to the crisis.
628
While his executives saw only disaster, he recognized opportunity disguised as catastrophe.
629
Most leaders facing such circumstances either freeze in analysis, paralysis, or make incremental adjustments that preserve dignity but fail to match the problem's magnitude.
630
Harvey chose the third path, dramatic action that seemed reckless but was actually precisely calibrated to market conditions.
631
His willingness to thrust aside dignity and act decisively when competitors hesitated created the opening he needed.
632
Sometimes the best strategy isn't the most sophisticated one.
633
It's the one bold enough to cut through the noise and force immediate market response.
634
The other thing that's interesting here to me is that he got rid of people who were only half-hearted.
635
He put the sales manager on vacation and took his job, removed salespeople that wouldn't get on board.
636
As he said, it was no time for half-hearted work.
637
The bold price cuts were just the beginning.
638
The crisis forced Harvey to confront the organizational bloat that had metastasized during the boom years, and he responded with surgical precision.
639
The advertising department slashed from 105 people to seven.
640
The elaborate divisional structure completely scrapped with all branches now reporting directly to Harvey.
641
Each location was stripped to its essentials, just a sales manager and office manager, with the sales manager expected to actively sell rather than supervise.
642
For every position, Harvey asked one brutal question, can we get along without this job?
643
By 1921, the sales force had been cut by 75%.
644
Those who remained faced intense pressure and lower salaries.
645
He was deliberately filtering for people who could stand the gaffe, and these were the only men we wanted.
646
Manufacturing had spawned similar excesses.
647
Vice presidents, department heads, and multiple management layers generating an avalanche of memos, reports, and meetings.
648
Harvey later recalled with dark humor, we wrote so many notes that the vice presidents and their assistants and their assistants often used to get a day or two behind in the reading of them, and we had to devise a bright red inner office telegram for really urgent business.
649
The crisis prompted radical simplification.
650
The charts went out the window.
651
We abolished offices and departments.
652
We called for all the forms that were in use.
653
The statistics department shrank from 35 people to three while maintaining access to essential information.
654
The office force dropped from 1,000 to 800.
655
Recovery proved slow and painful.
656
Profits for 1921 totaled less than $1 million.
657
But through relentless discipline, Harvey achieved what had seemed impossible.
658
By October 31st, 1924, the company did not owe a dollar to any bank.
659
Reflecting on this period, Harvey distilled the experience into enduring wisdom.
660
By hammering on economies, by pressing sales and qualities, and by never fooling ourselves as to where we stood, we had wiped out an indebtedness which at one time was thought to be crushing.
661
What's instructive here is how the crisis revealed what was actually necessary versus what merely felt important during prosperous times.
662
When survival was at stake, Harvey discovered that most of the organizational complexity they'd built was theater, impressive looking but fundamentally useless.
663
As I like to say, simple scales and fancy fails.
664
Elaborate systems often collapse under pressure while simple focused operations prove anti-fragile.
665
Sometimes you need a crisis to show you what really matters.
666
Success sows the seeds of its own destruction.
667
Harvey's autobiography ends in the mid-1920s with a fascinating reflection on why he kept working despite having already made his fortune.
668
There is a notion, he wrote, that if a man has established a business and accumulated a certain competence and then keeps on working, it is only because he is greedy and wants more and more money and that eventually he just becomes a slave, a slave to money.
669
Harvey completely rejected this view.
670
After 25 years of building his company, he had no plans to stop.
671
He didn't care whether he was the slave or the master.
672
This mindset explains why Harvey handled the 1920 crisis so differently from his panicked executives.
673
The bold 25% price cut reflected his genuine belief that challenges make businesses worthwhile.
674
As he put it, the very worries and insistent demands on one's mentality and physique are a joy, for they are tests and challenges.
675
This reminds me of Brad Jacobs and his mentor and the conversation they had around problems.
676
Business is just a series of problems.
677
They're just opportunities.
678
You better get used to it.
679
For Harvey, business wasn't a game to be won or a science to be mastered.
680
It was something more fundamental.
681
You couldn't build it and walk away because no business will run itself.
682
That's why he demolished elaborate management structures the moment they stopped serving their purpose.
683
Money mattered, certainly, but his actions revealed deeper motivations.
684
When he personally took over sales during the crisis, slashed prices and cut organizational fat, he was fighting for something beyond wealth.
685
He was fighting for the work itself.
686
He maintained a practical view of profits, deliberately causing a business to operate without profits through some foggy concept of benevolence is only another way of destroying the service of that business.
687
This clear-eyed approach helped him navigate both boom and bust with equal effectiveness.
688
What's instructive here is Harvey's understanding that meaningful work provides its own compensation beyond money.
689
People need to be a part of something larger than themselves and find genuine satisfaction in solving problems, building systems, and creating value.
690
It turns out these remain engaging regardless.
691
The best founders aren't motivated by money, but rather the reward of building something that matters with the people they love.
692
Beyond balance sheets and profit margins, Harvey was driven by something deeper, business as a school of experience that provided unparalleled opportunities for growth.
693
What truly satisfied him was the greatest pleasure is in doing something to help others to help themselves, not through charity, but through genuine opportunities for independence.
694
His ship-by-truck movement exemplified this philosophy, opening doors for countless entrepreneurs in trucking and transportation.
695
Even during brutal cost-cutting, he was fighting to save the company that provided thousands of livelihoods.
696
I like people, Harvey wrote.
697
And business brings one in close contact with a never-ending stream of people.
698
This human connection shaped his leadership style, personally hitting the road during crisis instead of hiding beneath memos and management layers.
699
What ultimately sustained Harvey was the supreme satisfaction of accomplishment, of planning to do something and carrying through those plans against all obstacles to a final accomplishment.
700
The obstacles had been formidable, launching against established competitors, pivoting from carriage to automobile to tires, pioneering truck tires, surviving financial booms and collapses, and building an international enterprise.
701
Harvey stepped down as president in 1932, turning over operations to his son while remaining chairman until his death in 1938.
702
By then, the company he'd started with 12 employees commanded 25% of the entire U.S.
703
tire market, with sales exceeding $156 million.
704
Beyondary for his friendships with Henry Ford and Thomas Edison.
705
Their famous vagabonds camping trips captured America's imagination, symbolizing the nation's transformation into the automobile age.
706
After Harvey's death, Firestone remained in family hands for decades, playing a crucial role during World War II and expanding globally through the post-war boom.
707
Though Bridgestone acquired the company in 1988, the Firestone brand endures today.
708
Harvey's core business philosophy remains strikingly relevant.
709
Capital isn't that important in business.
710
Experience isn't that important.
711
You can get both.
712
What is important is ideas.
713
I would add and determination and persistence and all the things that we talk about on the Outlier series.
714
His emphasis on innovation over resources, people over systems, and integrity as the keystone of business continues resonating today.
715
What's most instructive about Harvey's legacy isn't the size of the Empire he built, but how he built it through relentless questioning of assumptions, maintaining financial discipline during both boom and bust, and never losing sight of the human element in business.
716
He proved that sustainable success comes from not following industry conventions, but from having the courage to find better ways when established paths don't serve your vision.
717
His story reminds us all that the most powerful competitive advantage often lies not in what you know, but in your willingness to challenge what everyone else assumes to be true.
718
Okay, let's dive into the reflections and afterthoughts.
719
And I have a few comments before we get to the lessons that we can take away from Harvey.
720
Well, what an amazing entrepreneur he was.
721
What a force.
722
I first came across the book Men in Rubber, I think it was about 10 years ago.
723
And I picked it up just randomly at a bookstore.
724
And I was so surprised by the amount of wisdom in this book.
725
that I started buying copies for all my friends.
726
And at one point, I think I probably owned about five or 10% of the inventory in this book.
727
You could only get it used, and it was becoming increasingly hard to find.
728
So I wanted to make this book easier for everyone to get their hands on.
729
So we republished it.
730
You can go on Amazon now and look up Men in Rubber, Harvey Firestone, and you can get a copy in hardcover, in softcover, Audible, and in Kindle.
731
And we wanted that because we just wanted everybody in the world to have access to this information.
732
So I hope you enjoy the book.
733
So there's an interesting anecdote in the book about Henry Ford that I think is worth highlighting.
734
And I'm going to read you a direct excerpt here.
735
It's commonly imagined that Mr.
736
Ford arrives at his decisions quickly.
737
Nothing could be further from the fact.
738
He reaches his decisions slowly and alone.
739
He does not jump at anything.
740
And so when the time comes for execution, everything moves with marvelous rapidity because everything has been previously thought through and planned.
741
He has had the time to do this thinking and planning because he has used his time himself instead of permitting others to use it for him.
742
And he is certain that plans will be executed for him because he knows how to let men go when they grow too rich and lazy to execute.
743
There's a lot of wisdom in that.
744
And the two most profound sort of lessons in that excerpt are: one, thinking through things slowly and taking control of your time.
745
And the second is a bit ruthless, but obvious too, which is you.
746
And I think that's really interesting, especially in the time that we're in today of unparalleled AI transition.
747
And a lot of people are going to struggle because the easy parts of your job no longer exist.
748
Another excerpt from the book that I wanted to work in, and I think highlights a valuable lesson, but I couldn't find a really good way to do it was: I'm going to read you the excerpt.
749
Quick decisions that have not behind them a long train of thought are exceedingly dangerous.
750
Personally, I do not want to have around me the kind of man who can give me an instant decision on anything that I may bring up.
751
For if he has not had the opportunity to give the question serious thought, then he is only guessing and I can do my own guessing.
752
And that excerpt, a couple of things I want to point out there.
753
One, I like that.
754
He wanted to be surrounded by people who have thought.
755
The second thing I want to say is the book was published in 1926.
756
So keep that in mind with some of these excerpts.
757
The language about men, you know, there's some other a little bit scandalous language in the book itself, but for the time, it was sort of in line.
758
And I didn't make any effort to edit any of that when we republished it.
759
The other thing I want to point out just before we get to the lessons is that parts of this episode are entirely read by AI, an AI version of me.
760
And I'm playing around with AI a lot and I'm so curious.
761
It allows me to do things that I can't otherwise do.
762
And I'm wondering, you know, what you think of that.
763
If you actually identified the paragraphs or sections that are AI-based, send me an email.
764
And hopefully you like it.
765
It allows me to do more and scale better.
766
And I'm going to increasingly play around.
767
So Harvey was a force.
768
This book is packed with wisdom.
769
I got 14 lessons as I was rereading this book and doing this episode.
770
So the first is a taste for saltwater.
771
Most people quit when things get uncomfortable.
772
Harvey thrived on challenges.
773
When faced with a $43 million debt crisis in 1920, he said, the situation did not frighten me.
774
It put new life into me.
775
While his executives panicked, he saw opportunity.
776
Excellence isn't about avoiding difficulty.
777
It's about developing a perverse appreciation for discomfort that reveals who you really are.
778
Two, obsess over inputs.
779
Harvey's father taught him that a fine crop one year was more or less a fortunate accident.
780
Instead of chasing results, Harvey focused on controlling what he could, maintaining surplus inventory, questioning every process, and building systematic advantages.
781
Results are lagging indicators.
782
The only thing you can control is the process.
783
Three, high agency.
784
When industry cartels repeatedly excluded Harvey from tire associations and rim companies, he didn't just accept defeat.
785
He created superior alternatives.
786
There is always a better way of doing everything than the way which is standard at the moment.
787
It is a good thing for a man to be pushed into finding that better way.
788
High agency means treating every no as research, not rejection.
789
Create what you're denied access to.
790
Four, the courage to close doors.
791
Harvey could have stayed in the profitable solid tire business.
792
Despite the internal resistance that was so strong that he had to buy out a major shareholder, he pivoted to the tires we know today.
793
Sometimes you have to kill good options to pursue great ones.
794
Bias toward action.
795
When the 1920 crisis hit, Harvey didn't form committees or hire consultants.
796
He took the next steamer home, personally ran sales, and implemented a 25% cut within days.
797
A small reduction would not give the smash we had to have the big dramatic play.
798
Speed beats perfection when conditions demand decisive action.
799
Six, find the lever.
800
Rather than competing directly with established tire companies, Harvey solved the industry's inventory nightmare with roll tires.
801
The dealers could cut to size.
802
This innovation took us completely out of competition by eliminating the constraint that everyone else just accepted as permanent.
803
Seven, outthink, don't just outwork.
804
Harvey's two questions, is it necessary and can it be simplified?
805
transformed operations throughout Firestone.
806
When he questioned the industry belief that rubber needed aging, nobody could explain why.
807
Eliminating this unnecessary step saved millions.
808
The greatest advantage often comes not from working harder within complexity, but finding the clarity to recognize and eliminating it.
809
Eight, bounce don't break.
810
Every rejection became Harvey's competitive advantage.
811
Excluded from the Clincher Tire Association, he developed straight-sided tires.
812
Refused by the RIM company, he started his own manufacturing.
813
Each setback revealed opportunities invisible.
814
Harvey's father taught him that a surplus was the greatest aid to business judgment and the key to being master of your own circumstances.
815
Harvey applied this principle during the 1907 panic, maintaining reserves and a margin of safety.
816
While his competitors scrambled to save their businesses, Harvey aggressively expanded.
817
10.
818
Win by not losing.
819
Harvey avoided the two obvious responses to competitive pressure, cutting quality or cutting prices without operational changes.
820
Instead, he innovated his way out of the trap.
821
Success often comes not from brilliance, but from disciplined avoidance of stupidity.
822
As I like to say, avoiding stupidity is easier than seeking brilliance.
823
11.
824
Always be enforced.
825
Harvey refused to make decisions from weakness.
826
During the 1920s crisis, he told his team, I will not tackle this job until Monday, and retreated to think clearly.
827
Even under extreme pressure, he acted from choice, not from panic.
828
Only move when you choose to.
829
12.
830
Never delegate core responsibilities.
831
While Firestone grew his company into thousands of employees, he maintained personal control over critical functions.
832
During crisis, he didn't rely on managers but took direct command of sales.
833
His philosophy was clear: if anything in the business is wrong, the fault is squarely with management.
834
The fault is mine.
835
True leadership means accepting ultimate responsibility.
836
13.
837
Simple scales, fancy fails.
838
During the boom, Firestone developed elaborate hierarchies, specialized conventions, and even published a million circulation magazine.
839
The crisis revealed this was all theater.
840
Harvey's two questions: is it necessary and can it be simplified?
841
Cut through organizational bloat that transforms successful companies into bureaucratic zombies.
842
And finally, 14, catch the right wave.
843
Harvey positioned himself at the intersection of major trends: the shift to automobiles, the rise of trucking, the need for transportation alternatives during World War I.
844
Rather than predicting the future, he positioned himself for multiple possible futures and rode the waves that materialized.
845
