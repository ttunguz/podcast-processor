1
And if you and I want to win championships and build a championship basketball team, we should not care where in the world the basketball player comes from.
2
We just need to get the best players on our team to win the championship.
3
And we ought to take the same approach to AI and technology.
4
Hey, Bill, great to see you.
5
Brett, how are you doing, man?
6
I'm doing great.
7
I'm doing great.
8, I'm heading back to Boston this weekend for my 25th HBS reunion.
9
25.
10
It's crazy.
11, you're way older than me, but I can't believe it's 25 years.
12
And I'm doing this talk on what's happening in AI,, these days.
13
And there's a lot of questions about comparisons because remember, we were there during the 99, 2000 boom and bust.
14
And so a lot of my classmates are wondering whether or not AI is that again.
15
And so I was going back and pulling together these slides.
16
And I have to say, a few things just shocked me, frankly.
17, I forgot how much has changed.
18
One was I was doing, I was looking and doing some analysis on Amazon.
19, I was day trading Amazon out of the back of the classroom back then.
20
And you were out here working on the IPO.
21
So I know you were paying attention to what the share price was in 98, 99, and 2000.
22
And a couple interesting points, right?
23
Amazon, if you recall, Bill, and I know you do, it peaked at $243 a share in 1998.
24
But at the start of 2000, it's at $150 bucks a share.
25
Okay?
26
And Henry Blodgett famously makes the call.
27
He calls $400 a share.
28
And he literally top ticks it from the year 2000.
29
And the thing plummets and goes down to about 26 bucks a share right he gets ridiculed and all this stuff but I want to know it went it went public at 17 and broke issue yes wow so it traded under under issue for about two months right and i i'm sure you didn't get any calls from the company about what the f was going on but here's the crazy thing right remember he gets ridiculed for making that call so i wanted to know and i went and i asked asked our chat gpt friend to help me with some split adjusted math on this so split adjusted from the high in 2000 which was this 150 that's equivalent to about 47 cents split adjusted today so it's up about 440x from where it was in 2000 and on a split adjusted basis from the low in 2000 it's up about 1800 x right those are shocking numbers and so that was one of the things that dawned so i said well what's happened to the nasdaq since we graduated well from the peak in 2000 the nasdaq is still up 5x and from the trough trough in 2000 it's up 10x and so i said what what's the punchline the punchline is we were a bunch of dreamy-eyed big big thinkers we thought we knew everything about the internet we we we knew it was going to change the world forever and it turns out we overestimated what it was going to do in the short term right over the next two to three years, adoption was slower.
30
We had the terrorist attacks in 2001.
31
We had an economic recession.
32
So things definitely grew slower.
33
But the biggest problem was there just weren't that many people connected to a high-speed internet.
34
So all the things we dreamed of occurring were just inefficient to happen at that time.
35
But what's probably even more surprising, Bill, is how dramatically we underestimated the long term.
36
Over the next 20 to 25 years, it blew away all of our estimates and forecasts in terms of how big these companies would be.
37
And so now we sit here at the dawn of the age of AI.
38
And I think people are asking a lot of these same questions.
39
But,, that was probably the biggest punchline on my 25-year reflection.
40
All right.
41
Well, if they listen to the podcast, they're going to miss your talk, maybe.
42
Maybe,, talking about this pace of AI, you and I were sending some things back and forth just about some strategic shifts going on in the world.
43
Talk us through that.
44
Well, obviously,, the pace continues crazy.
45
Every time,, between just the podcast episodes we do, which are about two to three weeks, there's new news always and constantly.
46
And it's hard to keep up with it.
47
But I do try and pay attention to the stuff that spikes in my brain as being strategic and something you should really pay attention to.
48
And one thing that I've seen in the past week, so this is very recent, is what I might call data walls.
49
And so everyone's recognizing the value of AI.
50
Everybody wants to have AI work against their data, against,, and everybody wants to wow the consumer or the customer of their product.
51
And so all of a sudden, though, we're seeing things pop up where people are trying to wall off data.
52
And,, one example would be Reddit just sued Anthropic this morning despite having a deal.
53
So it'd be interesting to unpack what's in there.
54
I think there's a tiff between WinSurf and Anthropic, where Anthropic cut them off to all their models.
55, WinSurf was bought by OpenAI.
56
Not that surprising, but just seeing these walls pop up.
57
I think a more interesting one in the enterprise case is Salesforce changed their terms of service and in a way that includes not only the CRM data, but Slack data, which is a company they bought.
58
And they're putting an MCP connector on top of it, which allows AI to query it.
59
But they're saying that you can't train on the data that's in there.
60
Hold on a second.
61
So Altimeter Slack data, I can't train on my own data?
62
That's what the change in the terms of service say.
63
You can query the MCP.
64
Yeah, I think it's,, I think maybe we'll start to talk about enterprise applications as either being open data or closed data.
65
And people are going to need to declare that.
66
But my guess is that if you're a competitor to Salesforce, you're immediately going to declare yourself open data and try and steal as many customers as possible.
67
I can't fathom in my own brain how upset I would be if I were paying seven, eight-figure license to Salesforce and they told me I couldn't train on my own data, which is basically everything about my customers and everything that I would want to analyze.
68
Now, I'm sure they're going to train on it and give you their AI agentic view of it, which is why they're doing this.
69
But battle lines are being drawn,, going back to the old song.
70, and one of the things you didn't mention, Bill, I just saw Kevin Weil, our friend, tweeted from OpenAI that Deep Research is now searching across GitHub, Google Docs, Gmail, Outlook, HubSpot, Dropbox.
71
Now, I think a lot of that's using MCP, but, I do agree with you that this all seems to be happening faster rather than slower.
72, it reminds me, you and I back in the day sitting in a Zillow board meeting and talking about people building dependencies on Google.
73
And you were very much aligned with you can't build a brand in the underbelly of Google because over time, they will have to take that territory back, right?
74
And I remember TripAdvisor peaked at $20 billion in value building a search engine, a recommendation engine in the underbelly of Google.
75
And then when Google decided it was time to do recommendations on its own, TripAdvisor's value went from 20 billion to 1 billion.
76
And,, but that happened over a period of many, many years, Bill.
77
And what I see happening here is in part because AI is going so much faster than the internet did, right?
78
I did, I saw some analysis from my team this week will post that OpenAI reached,, 400 billion annual searches, eight years faster than Google, right?
79
So they're doing over a billion searches a day now, right?
80
So all of this is happening in hyper speed.
81
And so the strategic plays by all of these companies to vertically integrate, to shut down,, access to data, because they all know that they need to monetize by offering that full stack.
82
And so,, that to me is something for these companies.
83
When you look at Windsurf, they're going to have to build their own models.
84
When you look at Cursor, they're building their own models, right?
85
The dependencies on,, all of these different open models, I think, is changing very well.
86
Well, and I'm sure Anthropic,, woke up on the Windsurf announcement and said, oh, wait,, OpenAI is going into verticals.
87, and we're good at coding.
88
So how do we think about this?
89
And yeah,, it's a reordering.
90
I think people really need to pay attention to this data thing.
91
If you look at where OpenAI wants to go on the consumer side,, access to your contacts, your calendar, your mail, all that's going to matter.
92
And you're going to want your personal assistant to be able to do that.
93
And whoever owns those systems, whether or not they try to block access to it or not, will be interesting.
94, Google has an advantage in that they own their own phone platform and they own their own Gmail platform and they own their own alternative to the Office stack.
95
And so,, they should be able to make that a competitive advantage.
96
But,, whether or not they'll be willing to put up a wall and say, Open it, I can't scrub this, it'll all be very interesting.
97
It's something that's super important to watch.
98, listen, I think it would be a bad development, right?
99, I think you and I both agree that MCP is a good development in allowing more open access.
100
At the end of the day, it should be my data.
101
It's my Gmail, right, that I'm paying for.
102
It's my Google Docs that I'm creating and I'm paying for.
103
And so, if you tell me that I'm not going to be able to use my AI of choice, right, accessing this information to make my life better to answer questions, that will lead to a lot of disruption.
104
So, but that is the question, right?
105
Because here we have Deep Research announcing today that they're going to access all those things using MCP on my behalf, which I'm excited about, right?
106
Because I am using all of those Google services, but I do the idea of using ChatGPT that has a lot of built-up memory about me to access those services.
107
So, I think you and I will certainly be loud and proud on the side of keeping this all open.
108
But we definitely see some early warning signs here of people closing down the ecosystem,, in order to try to protect some of those advantages.
109
Another topic, Bill,, we've talked a lot about China, and one of the interesting parts of our dialogue from my perspective over the course of the last few months is just how well China is doing in robots, in autos, in batteries, in precision manufacturing, deep seek coming out of nowhere, Huawei building,, chips that are catching up very quickly.
110
But you sent me this piece of research this week, and it's really enlightening because it talks about let a thousand flowers bloom, how they've, in fact, seeded these industries.
111
And there's probably some stuff we could learn here.
112
So, unpack it for me, Bill.
113
Why has this been so successful?
114
Yeah, and for the record, I had ChatGBT do the analysis.
115
It was version $4.5, the $200 a month version.
116
It's an amazing piece of research.
117
I guess it could have some errors in it, but we're going to post it so everybody can see it.
118
But yes, I think it's imperative that we understand exactly why China is so competitive in so many industries and what led them to be successful.
119
And what I uncovered, and I had heard this from a few other people in the past, but what I really uncovered the detail on is that in these industries where they want to succeed, they make sure that there are 500 competitors or 1,000 competitors.
120
And then they let the market whittle down to what the best one is.
121
So rather than, I think we have a perception that communist or authoritarian governments have a single state-sponsored company that's not very competitive.
122
That's not what they're doing.
123
They're doing something very different.
124
They're letting entrepreneurism and a Darwinian competition and survival of the fittest,, create the five companies that survive all of that as winners.
125
And we all know, because we believe in capitalism, that that has,, that system will lead to the very best shining at the end of the day.
126
Well, it's interesting, Bill, because,, you and I grew up with this model in Soviet Russia where they picked a state actor.
127
And part of the reason we won the Cold War is they bankrupted themselves.
128
All those state actors were terrible.
129
They were inefficient.
130
They were full of griff.
131
They couldn't compete.
132
Their products weren't any good.
133
But we see the exact opposite out of China.
134
We see products that are globally competitive,, and many that are in these different industries better than the U.S.
135
So there has to be something systematic and structurally different that they're doing, even though we refer to them as both both of them as communist systems.
136
Correct.
137
And I would,, I've studied these types of systems my whole life.
138
And,, I've mentioned before that I'm on the board of the Santa Fe Institute.
139
And this Darwinian competition is exactly the thing that I would, if you told me they were doing this before they did it, I'd say, well, that might work, right?
140 that's this is sensible to me that this works.
141
One thing that came out of it, in addition to just helping to identify winners,, there's a couple of other benefits you get from this.
142
One, you're exposed to way more optionality because 500 startups will try a bunch of different approaches.
143
And one thing I've uncovered in the past few weeks is Chinese LiDAR is solid state and designed very differently than the LIDAR that Waymo is using.
144
And it's in China right now is, I think, being priced at $130 a car, this solid state MEMS LIDAR, whereas the Waymo LiDAR is $5,000 a car.
145
So you end up in completely different places because of this type of competition.
146
And you have this many people trying different things.
147
And then the other big thing that happens is your supply chain develops in a lot more robust way because if I'm a supplier,, to a part that's important to a solar panel or to an EV, I now have 50 or 100 competitors.
148
So you end up, and that births more and more competitors in in for that part as well.
149
And so you end up with a much more robust supply chain, more players at each each step along the way and i i think the data suggests, and this this piece of research would suggest that's why they've been so successful in evs where there were over 500 ev startups 500 in the u.s what has there been four legitimate ones a handful so here's my question right in silicon valley we have this dynamic ecosystem of risk capital we're probably i don't know fourth fifth generation of risk capital and risk takers they find each other there's not a lot of government interaction or coordination with regard to that It just happens what are we saying how Is this ecosystem developed there's definitely venture capital in china but it seems to me as a fraction of the venture capital that that exists in the in the u.s or certainly the tightness of the ecosystem over the course of the last four or five years has been reduced dramatically because a lot of the u.s players right backed off from china so is it the state the different states and provinces that are seeding or subsidizing to get these 500 startups rolling how are they getting going yeah yeah so so the government involvement is at a provincial level and that's part of why there's such a high number a high number of startups in the area It's interesting if you take this as a conclusion oh this this worked this was very successful for them and then you turn and say what should the west do i think it's hard because when when our government's tried to get involved in startups it's never been about helping to ensure there were a thousand of them.
150
It's usually,, you create some program.
151
The one that's i stuck in my brain was solar, because i had a company in the space,, where there were probably 10,, solar startups that had raised over $500 million, and then three of them were able to,, court the players in D.C.
152
long enough to get money, Solyndra being the one that people remember the most because they eventually went bankrupt.
153
But that doesn't feel this thing, right?
154
That feels more regulatory capture and who can win,, at the highest level.
155
And it's more at the end of the game.
156
This is at the beginning of the game.
157
So I don't know.
158
I don't know if there's a U.S.
159
equivalent of this.
160
I'll need to think about that.
161
I think my first step was just to take a fresh look at why they've been successful.
162
And when I saw that the approach was so novel from what I had imagined it was, it was very eye-opening.
163
Well, one of the things you pointed out to me was that they deprioritize market caps, or I might even say over the last five years that they've attacked the largest market cap companies in favor, perhaps, of diversifying competition.
164
And so,, it seems the one thing I think we can definitively say, there's a hell of a lot more national coordination about what industries are important, their industrial policy identifies an industry.
165
Then what it seems they do from the,, central governing authority is they encourage all of the provinces to see these companies within,, their different areas, allow that competition to occur.
166
So, I guess the question is,, when you look at the U.S., where,, it's much more just unfettered competition, is this just, is the point here, just be aware of this?
167
Or are you suggesting that there are things that the U.S.
168
needs to do?
169, it seems in some ways the coordinated industrial policy that's now coming out of Washington, the stuff that the president is talking about, where we have to reonshore critical national industries, precision manufacturing, some medical supplies, some chips, some aluminum and steel.
170
That would seem to me to be fairly aligned with the industrial policy that you're discussing here.
171
Well, there's so much.
172
You just asked a question that might take four hours to answer, but let me just try and be as terse as possible in responding to it.
173
So I had ChatGPD do two more pieces of research.
174
The first one, this would be part two.
175
Part two is worth mentioning.
176
So I think most people believe that and talk about China subsidization.
177
So once winners are identified, there are situations where the government has helped subsidize.
178
BYD was in a situation where I think they were given $2 billion.
179
So that second part walks through cases of that.
180
I don't want to shy away from that part because that is the criticism that a lot of people bring to the table.
181
And so this will give a dump of that.
182
But the third thing, which you hinted at, which I think is very important to think about.
183
And before I get to any type of response, I want to make sure I fully understand what's happening.
184
And there does seem to be in China, and part three of this research walks through this, a deprioritization of market cap of successful companies.
185
And this is something that I think should be important for policymakers to understand, but also investors.
186
If you're buying stocks of Chinese companies,, hoping that they will,, the MAG 7, turn into these $3 trillion entities.
187
The Chinese government may not consider that part of the objective function of what a win is.
188
And in the past three weeks, we saw BYD take prices down 30%.
189
That may have had encouragement from the government.
190
I don't have proof of that.
191
But it looks synonymous with the kinds of things that matter to them.
192
And so if your government cared mostly about high employment and cared mostly about the durability of the competitiveness of your companies globally, you might take what I would call the Amazon approach and say, your margin is my opportunity.
193
I'm going to be the low-cost producer.
194
And that's going to make my competitive position relative to other countries around the world the best it can be.
195
And if I don't have a government that's dependent upon whether or not those market caps are high or not, then I might encourage price competition in an industry that we're already winning at.
196
Well, and that's consistent.
197 if you look at as winners begin to emerge, right, China definitely plays a heavier hand, right?
198
You have golden shares and veto rights by the government.
199
You have preferential procurement by the government.
200
You have regulatory approvals that are required.
201
And,, in this post-DD era where they went public,, we've seen the government literally,, they disappear, Jack Ma with respect to Alibaba.
202
They've stepped in, right?
203
We have Byte Dance that still is not public.
204
So clearly, they exert way more control once the winners emerge.
205
We know that they're doing this at some level with Huawei as well.
206
And all those topics that you just mentioned, they're all covered in these three pieces.
207
So if people have more interest, I would encourage them to read it.
208
But I think in the U.S., we have a mindset that, oh, having $3 trillion winners is a positive sign.
209
And I think it's important to understand that that may not be the attitude over there.
210
And that can lead to different decision-making.
211
You're making me think about some of the relative valuation comparisons between Chinese internet companies and U.S.
212
companies.
213
If you really think that there's going to be an obstacle to allowing them to grow bigger, that's something U.S.
214
investors have to take into account.
215
Well, I think the number one thing for me, Bill, the so what on all of this, is that we're in this competition with China.
216
And I think we would be very naive to think that they're going to do anything but be extraordinarily competitive.
217
You and I have argued they're on the frontier of AI already.
218
They're gaining ground quickly on chips and right on our heels.
219
And so I appreciated unpacking a little bit the why.
220, why have they been successful there?
221
So that was my takeaway.
222
Bill, are there any other takeaways from the research that you have?
223
Well, there are two.
224
One,, I think a lot of people quip quickly that, oh, China's successful because of IP theft.
225
Or,, I think if you narrow it down to one,, derogatory action or comment, you're ignoring this system.
226
And that's why I would encourage people to read that part one at least and just see the breadth of the work that went into place because you could make a bad policy decision because you think, oh, well, if we just protect IP, then this won't keep happening.
227
But there's more happening than that,, and so that'd be part one.
228
And then second, on the AI front, one thing we talked about last time is,, all of a sudden you open your eyes and there's four deep-pocketed open source players in China.
229
And if you think about,, promoting competitiveness as part of what's going to lead to global success, I wouldn't be shocked to learn or find out that the government favored,, an approach that and having four open source competitors for all the reasons that the systems they put in place for EVs and solar panels, to me, those are very similar.
230
Right, right.
231
So it just makes it cheaper and easier for the ecosystems to benefit from one another, even though the economics and the margins on those products may be lower.
232
Yes.
233
And one other thing that I should have mentioned that might be an objective function of the CCP is just the affordability to their entire citizenry.
234
So,, BYD selling a car for 10 grand is better for the consumer in China, as might be,, four open source AI models.
235
Interesting.
236
Well, staying on the theme of China, Bill, you and I have talked a ton over the past two years about the need to stop illegal immigration, but to dramatically ramp up recruiting and retaining the best and the brightest to the United States.
237
Totally.
238, we've done former pods on this.
239
And we've talked about the age of AI as all about talent.
240
I remember how excited we were after we saw the president on the all-in pod talking about how it's going to become way easier to get an H-1B visa, literally stapling a green card to these diplomas.
241
But what I want to do and what I will do is you graduate from a college.
242
I think you should get automatically as part of your diploma a green card to be able to stay in this country.
243
And that includes junior colleges too.
244
Anybody graduates from a college, you go in there for two years or four years.
245
If you graduate or you get a doctorate degree from a college, you should be able to stay in this country.
246
And more stories than I do, but I know of stories where people graduated from a top college or from a college and they desperately wanted to stay here.
247
They had a plan for a company, a concept, and they can't.
248
They go back to India.
249
They go back to China.
250
They do the same basic company in those places and they become multi-billionaires employing thousands and thousands of people and it could have been done here.
251
And a bigger example is you need a pool of people to work for your companies.
252
You have great companies and they have to be smart people.
253
Not everybody can be less than smart.
254
You need brilliant people.
255
And we force the brilliant people, the people that graduate from college, the people that are number one in their class from the best colleges, you have to be able to recruit these people and keep the people.
256
It was such a big deal.
257
Somebody graduates at the top of the class, they can't even make a deal with the company because they don't think they're going to be able to stay in the country.
258
That is going to end on day one.
259
But this week we got a very different message, right?
260
Marco Rubio tweeted: the U.S.
261
will begin revoking visas of Chinese students, including those with connections to the CCP, which seemed reasonable.
262
But the conjunction was, or studying in critical fields.
263
Right?
264
And that seemed out of the gates.
265 we all know AI is a critical field.
266
It seemed really broad and concerning and really a 180-degree turn from what the president had previously said on the all-in pod.
267
I saw that you tweeted something about this.
268
What was your reaction to this?
269
And how are you feeling about where we stand today on it?
270
Yeah,, and I think in one of our very first episodes, we posted a video of Reagan, which I think it was his last speech leaving office, where he talked about America,, being successful precisely because our doors are open and inviting to the best and brightest from around the world.
271
And all of that makes sense to me.
272
And this particular action, I think, has the potential to run counter to all those positive things.
273
I,, I wish there had been more follow-up on the Trump promise.
274
I would be hugely supportive of that.
275
We've all seen the list of all the immigrants that have been so successful and critical to Silicon Valley's own success.
276
And,, you and I have also talked about the fact that some people say 50% of AI researchers are of Chinese origin.
277
And I believe now the patent count in AI coming out of China is larger than the U.S.
278
And so, yeah, one interesting takeaway from what we just talked about is maybe the Chinese government isn't as interested in entrepreneurs being as successful economically,, from an equity standpoint.
279
So, if we're that land of opportunity, they would want to be here.
280
They would want to be a citizen here.
281
They would want to build their companies here.
282
And so, I really think,, and look, I'm all for not having spies, right?
283
That makes sense.
284
But when you take these broad statements and,, and they have the potential to be slippery slopes, right?
285
Where the next step is what?
286
You start,, studying LinkedIn for every single AI company, for anyone of Chinese origin.
287
I think that has the potential to take on a McCarthy-,, perspective that could be very dangerous to our long-term competitiveness.
288
Well, I think part of it, too, is just about brand USA.
289, what is the brand we want to project into the world?
290
Right?
291, it's not just about the students who are already here.
292
It's about the generation of students who are still in China or still in Southeast Asia or anywhere else in the world, in South Africa, Elon and Sachs and,, and others.
293, is this a place that they feel is capricious and can just change on a dime and all of a sudden throw them out after they've invested time and energy here?
294
Or is this truly the land of opportunity, the place they want to go build their dreams?
295
And I think that the cost to the U.S.
296
brand on a global basis, we have been the place for the last three, four decades or much, much longer, but certainly in the age of technology, everybody's wanted to come and do these things.
297
It's ignored to our great national benefit.
298
Trillions and trillions of dollars worth of U.S.
299
enterprise, our economic growth, our economic productivity, our standard of living is higher.
300
We've stayed ahead in all of these critical national security areas precisely because we've been so inviting to people around the world.
301
And we were making the argument when we had Aaron Levy on that we need to dramatically increase the number of H-1B visas and make it a lot easier for people to get them.
302
And so when I hear this,, I have to say, out of everything that's occurred in the administration, in some respects, I could not have been more thrilled by the president's promise on the all-in pod.
303
I thought that was a big turning point, I think, for folks in Silicon Valley.
304
And so to see this, what felt a 180 on this, I certainly hope that it was misinterpreted, that it's very narrow, that we are going to project an inviting and welcoming brand America.
305
Certainly, man, right now it is so critical in the age of AI to get the world's best researchers here.
306 you said, I saw a study that suggested that 40 to 50 percent of the AI researchers in the United States, our best researchers, are Chinese.
307
So if you're going to go after Chinese students studying AI at Stanford, by definition, the slippery slope is not that far to say, I got to go after these researchers.
308
They're a lot more risk to our national security theoretically than a student studying at Stanford.
309
Again, I'm with you.
310
I'm all about being tough.
311
You got to be here legally.
312
I don't want anybody spying on us.
313
But I think it's a very dangerous place and really destructive to our national brand if we do this.
314
And so,, when I saw your tweet about this, the best way to stay ahead of China is to poach their talent.
315, just a few weeks ago, we were talking about an AI visa, right?
316
That if you were an AI researcher from China in the United States, we ought to give your family an AI visa to come over here so that you don't have so much pressure on you to go back to China.
317
So we need to find out where we need to bottom this out, but I certainly want to weigh in that we need to focus on just merely trying to understand China, why it's successful, and all those things.
318
Some people label you as a Chinophile,, just because you're not a China hawk.
319
And I worry more in general that the China hawk mindset leads you to policy that's really bad,, especially people that jump to that place.
320
And a lot of people are these days, right?
321
And so I just think that policy is one of those things where you can have an intent and you can implement a policy and you can get the exact opposite outcome, which was one of the things I talked about back in the year.
322
The export controls on China probably is what caused Huawei to catch up so quickly.
323, the Biden-era diffusion rule was going to allow the Chinese AI stack to win the global race in AI,, and now we see, and I think Sachs has appropriately called this out, we see this conflating between people who are just AI decelerationists and want to stop AI and capture it for themselves, right?
324
Now they're positioning themselves as China hawks so that they can gather a bigger alliance in order to slow this down.
325
I think it's all bad policy.
326
From my perspective, we need to focus on our own race, look at the lane ahead, run as fast as we can.
327
And if you and I want to win championships and build a championship basketball team, we should not care where in the world the basketball player comes from.
328
We just need to get the best players on our team to win the championship.
329
And we ought to take the same approach to AI and technology.
330
And I,, other people have said this, so I don't want to belabor it too much, but the entire Manhattan Project was heavily impacted by immigrants.
331 many of the great things that have been accomplished in this nation are because it attracts people from around the world.
332
We get to cherry-pick the best and the brightest.
333
And so, yeah, the fact that the skilled immigration number has been stuck, I think, at 2,000 to 250,000 a year for 20 years is insanity.
334
And we should be doing the opposite of this.
335
We should be figuring out exactly how to increase that number.
336
Brad, staying on the topic of China, the rare earth issue has come back to the top of the headlines.
337
And the relationship between the two countries still is at an impasse.
338
What are you hearing?
339
What's the latest here?
340
How could it broadly affect companies in the U.S.?
341, there was this Wall Street Journal headline that you and I shared.
342
I think it said, China plays tough on rare earth exports and imparts powerful lessons on the pains of dependence.
343
And it pointed to car companies, risk factory shutdowns,, over this rare earth magnet shortage.
344
And we had been hearing about this.
345
Remember, earlier in the year, I think I called it a kill shot by China can really cause massive disruption because they really are a global monopolist in the production of key magnets in almost every electric motor and electric parts.
346
And so the real question is:, is there a way out of this?
347
How do we see this,, playing out?
348
And I see a real parallel, Bill, here between rare earths and AI chips.
349
Okay.
350
In both instances, each country views them as existential, right?
351
China views AI chips as existential because they know AGI is critical to national security, national economic security, et cetera.
352
We view these magnets as existential because we got to keep our critical industries going.
353
We use this to not only build electric motors that go in our Teslas, but we use them in electric motors that go into parts that are critical to our military.
354
So I was thinking about this, right?
355
President Xi's talking, or President Trump is talking to Xi on Friday, a couple days from now.
356
And if I were the president, what would I do?
357
I think I would trade rare earths for access to U.S.
358
AI chips, specifically this now deprecated Blackwell 30 chip.
359
And let me explain why.
360
Let me maybe make four or five points as to why I think this would be a great trade for the U.S.
361
at this point in time.
362
Number one, this B30 is this deprecated chip.
363
So one of the concerns we had about the H20 was that there was too much high bandwidth memory on it, right?
364
And that, if you cluster enough of them together, could be used for training.
365
So, what they did on the B30 is they took it took HBM off it altogether.
366
And it also doesn't use this co-as from TSMC.
367
So, it gives them a chip that's competitive in the market, but it deprecates it from a training perspective.
368
It still provides a big gap to where the U.S.
369
frontier chips are, the Blackwell 200 and 300, but it is competitive in the Chinese market.
370
And so, what does that do?
371
We've talked about this the last few weeks.
372
That keeps,, half of the world's researchers and the developers in the AI ecosystem are in China.
373
It keeps them in that CUDA ecosystem, allows NVIDIA to compete, and I think slows down their ability to run the table around the rest of the world.
374
I think when we ban chips to China, it's going to accelerate Huawei, we just talked about, unintended consequences.
375
It's going to bring everybody into their developer ecosystem, and it's going to reduce the amount of developers in the NVIDIA ecosystem.
376
So, I think that's a bad thing.
377
Number two, selling them these chips, right, which I don't think materially advances their cause on AI, generates billions and billions of dollars of taxes to the U.S.
378
government, right?
379
It reduces our trade deficit.
380
Remember, if we're selling them $40 billion worth of chips, and all of a sudden we take it to zero, we've just increased our trade deficit by $40 billion.
381
And finally, it produces billions in revenue or in profits to NVIDIA, which they can then plow back into making sure that NVIDIA stays at the front of the AI race, which is a proxy for the U.S.
382
staying in front in AI.
383
So, that's point two.
384
On point three, it gets us, right, if we do this trade, and I don't know that China would do this trade, but if we did this trade, then it would get us access to those rare earths right now, which is absolutely critical.
385
And it buys us time to stand up our own rare earth supply.
386
There's no doubt what this moment has revealed to both China and to the United States is that we have to get back to our critical industries, precision manufacturing, rare earths, et cetera.
387
But that's going to take years to do.
388
And China, I'm sure, is saying to themselves, we've got to wean our dependency off of NVIDIA, but it also takes them years to do.
389
So it allows us to continue to build that out without the disruption.
390
If we don't do this, then we're going to have a massively disrupted economy over the next six quarters, slowing down economic growth and causing problems and critical shortages in parts to the military, in parts to our U.S.
391
auto industry, et cetera.
392
So I would say the next point, I'll call this the final one, and then I want to get your reaction.
393
If we keep the chip ban in place, here's my biggest concern.
394
I think it dramatically increases the chances that China is forced to move on Taiwan.
395
We're out there telling everybody in the world that AI is totally existential.
396
We have lots of our leaders who are saying AGI is going to be eclipsed within the next two to three years.
397
But yet we're telling one of the largest economic powers on the planet, but we're going to prevent you from having it.
398
Right?
399
And so there's a way they can say, well, if that is so existential as a risk to our country, we just have to go take Taiwan, which I don't think would be horrible for the United States.
400
By the way, I think it'd be terrible for China as well.
401
But it would be a hugely risky event in the world, particularly because the U.S.
402
needs another three to four years to diversify our supply chain away from China.
403
Yeah.
404
So, three reactions to this.
405
First,, and they're all in agreement, but yeah, it'd be tough to balance trade if we don't let them have the stuff we're really good at.
406, the stuff you trade.
407, this is compared to this is economics 101.
408, the country,, you sell the stuff you're best at.
409
So, if you take that off the table, they're not going to buy our crap.
410
And so,, there's no way to get to a trade balance if you're taking our best stuff off the table.
411
I totally agree on Taiwan.
412
I've made this point for a while.
413
I think Jeffrey Sachs makes the same point.
414
You need to be careful that the actions you're taking aren't the exact ones that encourage that to happen the most quickly.
415
And then, thirdly,, part of why we're in this battle over these rare earth components is that we did these export controls, and it wasn't just about the NVIDIA chips.
416
I think recently we are trying to tell the world they can't buy the Huawei chips.
417
So, this is outside of America trying to enforce an export ban on China's products, selling into Europe, selling into South America.
418
I think that is,, something that is beyond the scope of what our government should be capable of doing.
419
And I've talked about this in the past.
420, I expect,, SML to just ignore us telling them they can or can't do something.
421
And I worry, and I've mentioned this before, but I worry that rather than build a wall around China, we're going to build a wall around America.
422
Yep.
423
Well, it's well said.
424
And listen, I think huge credit goes to David Sachs and Howard Lutnick so far for repealing the Biden diffusion rule by reopening up the global markets, making sure America's running as fast as we can.
425
The American AI stack can win around the world.
426
I think it's a closer call for them on U.S.
427
chips to China.
428
But this deprecated chip, I hope they take a close look at it.
429
I think it would be a great win-win trade for both countries.
430
We need those rare earths.
431
And by the way, I'm not saying that this is a permanent state of nature.
432
Think about this, Bill.
433
Today we have about 0% of leading edge chips fabbed outside of Taiwan, right?
434
Almost nothing in the United States.
435
And by 2020 or by 2030, so in four or five years from now, people think that we'll have upwards of 15 to 20 percent leading edge capacity in the United States, which is a huge step forward.
436
I saw a presentation this week involving the United Arab Emirates, where if they were to build an advanced fab with TSMC and give the U.S.
437
some sovereign influence over this fab, right?
438
So if it was a joint deal, that we could increase the market share of the United States advanced nodes to almost 40 or 50 percent in four years.
439
That would be an extraordinary rebalancing of the global supply chain when it comes to advanced chips.
440
But we're not going to do that if we're in a war over Taiwan, right?
441
And so it would seem to me that now would be the time that you would find this reasonable middle ground.
442
We would run hell to build out capability in Arizona and in other countries the UAE that are friendly to us,, where we're building out this leading edge capability.
443
It would seem to me a much smarter policy than pursuing the one that we're on now, where we have global embargoes, the Chinese on rare earths and us on chips.
444
Enough said on that.
445
I want to jump.
446
I know that time's short.
447
Let's talk a little bit about just what's going on in the market.
448
You had some thoughts.
449
Well,, I'm more interested in hearing your thoughts.
450
So you were cautious at the beginning of the year.
451
You got less cautious that the market has rebounded.
452
Yet, many of the biggest issues that I think people care about, whether or not we can get some agreement with China, what's going to happen with the tariffs, and there's new information on that: judges blocking and not blocking the tariff talk.
453
And then the debt issue, which now is there's a whole bunch of noise being stirred up by Elon,, now saying he doesn't support the big beautiful bill.
454
So there seems to me, to me, to be as much uncertainty as there's ever been this year.
455
But I'm very curious on your take.
456
Well, the market's clearly not agreeing with you at the moment, Bill.
457, we've had this incredible bounce.
458
The NASDAQ's up 20% from its intraday lows.
459
Now it's just above flat for the year, maybe up 1%.
460
The SP also has had a huge bounce, now up 2% for the year.
461
Yes, I think it was on May 2nd or early in May where we talked about us changing the flight path because I saw this approach to getting to the other side of tariffs, the Besant consensus winning, signing the reconciliation bill that would extend the tax cuts and have new tax stimulus.
462
And so, as I sit here today, the bounce makes a lot of sense to me.
463
But where we go from here matters a lot.
464
And so, what are the key things that I'm looking at?
465
Well, first, on tariffs, China is the big enchilada.
466
The president's talking with President Xi on Friday, and you have to believe that the Besant consensus or accord that was negotiated in Geneva, that we are going to get to a status where global tariffs are going to land in that territory,, on a blended basis around the world of 10-15%, right?
467
So, we talked about are they going to be trillions or are they going to be hundreds of billions?
468
It's got to land in that lower quadrant, or I think the market moves lower.
469
And I think that's still where we're headed.
470
But they're definitely the topic we just talked about, there's some binary outcomes, I think, as it relates to us in China.
471
It looks Europe is making good progress.
472
Now, on the reconciliation bill, it looked that was making incredible progress.
473
I still think it will.
474
Listen, I think that Elon has appropriately pointed out that the challenges with the debt, but I would really encourage people to look at this Ray Dalio piece and also what Besant has now been saying.
475
They call it 333, but it's how to get us to 3% GDP growth, right?
476
And how to get us to a debt-to-GDP ratio of 3%.
477
You can't just cut $2 trillion in a single year.
478
That would be an 800-basis point headwind to GDP.
479
It would throw us into a recession, if not depression- state.
480
Because you have so, remember, government spending is a component of GDP.
481
And so, it's about what is the flight path?
482
And I would to see Besant lay out this four or five, six-year plan to this 3% debt to GDP ratio.
483
It's not going to happen in the reconciliation bill because, again, as many people have discussed, the reconciliation bill does not touch discretionary spending.
484
That will come by way of the Rescission Act that was just sent to Congress and the Speaker of the House has said that he's going to vote on, and I expect that they will pass.
485
So there's,, I think it's a confusing set of issues.
486
But to be clear, I think that we need to see the reconciliation bill passed because that's what extends the tax cuts, which I think are critical.
487
In the absence of that, you get a $4 trillion tax increase and markets go a lot lower.
488
In addition to that, the no tax on tips, the no tax on overtime, the ability to have a deduction against your Social Security taxes, that's probably $300 or $400 billion of new stimulus to the economy.
489
That's what's going to give you the growth, Bill, to get you back to 3%.
490
So I think if you're a market participant, I believe that we're going to land the plane on both of those.
491
And if you believe that we're going to land the plane, then I see accelerating economic growth in the back half of the year and into next year.
492
But this is,, be optimistic, right?
493
But the proof is in the pudding.
494
We've got to see those things land there.
495
And if they don't, I expect the market will be back down 10 to 15 percent, which is where we were just a few weeks ago.
496
So there's still a lot of volatility out there.
497
There's been a lot of talk about these the 10-year rates, Bill.
498
Yeah.
499
And one thing I just want to point out, because the 10-year rates have gone from 4-2 to bounce back up to 4-4, 4-5.
500
And a lot of people are hand-wringing about this and saying this just goes to prove that we're in this national debt spiral and nobody wants to buy our debt.
501
But I just want to point out.
502
I think they compare them to Spain and other countries that were in liquidity crisis not too long ago.
503
Yeah, but I just want to point out, several other people have, yields, the 10-year has been in a 4% to 5% range, Bill, for the last two years.
504
And,, this is far, there were people, remember Larry Summers at the end of 2022 saying that the 10-year is going to 7%, right?
505
That's what caused hyperinflation.
506
We're going to have hyperinflation.
507
What have we seen?
508
Core PCE just came out lower than people expected, right?
509
We're now on a core PCE run rate that causes me to believe that the Fed will now reduce rates.
510
The market's saying they're going to cut rates twice in the back half of the year.
511
Why?
512
Because we're still in restrictive territory.
513
The Fed has said we're in restrictive territory.
514
They've said there's not a new neutral rate.
515
And so the bond market to me at these levels is not that concerning.
516
Seriously, I would an important national discussion on a balanced budget amendment or some other mechanism to get us to this 3% target.
517
I think that's super important.
518
But if you're saying, okay, should I be really scared that we're on a path to 7% interest rates over the course of the next six months?
519
No, I think you could very well find yourself in the exact opposite position.
520
I think if they sign the reconciliation bill and they land the deal on China, right, and then you get a couple rate cuts in the back half of the year because inflation continues to come in, this market's going to be a lot higher.
521
So don't take yourself out of the game, but I think it is a wait-and-see approach.
522
And what do you put the probability on the deal with China coming together?
523
I put it as a pretty high probability.
524
And,, remember, I was asked about this on CNBC in the heat of the crisis.
525
And I said,, because Trump was putting Navarro on the Sunday talk shows and Bessett, and they had two very different points of view.
526
And I said, you have door one, door choose, and the president's got to choose, right?
527
And I said at the time, I think at the end of the day, he wrote a book called The Art of the Deal.
528
He is a negotiator.
529
He is a fair trader.
530
He wants a fair deal for the United States.
531
He wants to reonshore critical national industries.
532
But I do not think he wants to slam the brakes on the global economy and put the global economy into a recession, which he knows it would.
533
And so I expect we'll get a deal done with China, but that means that China's got to step up and be willing to deal as well.
534
I think the tea leaves read pretty good on that, but we'll know a lot more over the course of the next few weeks.
535
Okay.
536
Okay, I have a couple of things for our lightning round, Bill.
537
Okay.
538, you talked to, we had a great discussion last week on this Delaware situation.
539
And I think you've been out in front on this, telling companies that if you sat on their board, they got to consider exiting Delaware.
540
Otherwise, they may be breaching their fiduciary duties.
541
I saw Fortune magazine quoted you, wrote their headline with something's awry in Delaware.
542
New study reveals lawyers in tiny U.S.
543
states are winning fee multipliers from major companies up to 66 times their normal hourly rate.
544
You got two and a half million views on this Delaware clip after you got a little promo from Sachs and Elon.
545
But was there any feedback you got this week?
546
Did you hear from companies?
547
Are they reconsidering whether or not they want to be in Delaware?
548
Oh, I think a lot of companies are reconsidering.
549
And,, there are two things that I would add that have become clear to me since then.
550
But one, people talk about, well, who is at risk here?
551
I think it's the highest profile companies that are at risk because they're the ones that an activist judge is going to want to make an exception out of.
552
And so,, maybe if you're a smaller market cap company, maybe it's not something you need to think about with urgency.
553
And we discussed this.
554
The reason people were in Delaware is because it was predictable.
555
That was the, if someone, when you're a young entrepreneur and they say, oh, incorporate in Delaware, you're, what?
556
Why would I do that?
557
And someone says, oh, well, they've had corporate law for a long time.
558
It's very predictable.
559
And oh, okay.
560
And so everybody does it.
561
Well, that's no longer true.
562
And so I think everyone has to consider it.
563
The other thing that I verified that I think is really important.
564
We live in an age where companies are staying private longer.
565
I think many entrepreneurs, many board members think that litigation around shareholder events are tied solely to public companies.
566
That is not true.
567
If you're incorporated in Delaware, you can be sued.
568, if your shares are trading more freely in the secondary market, you're at risk as well.
569
And so I would just say just because you're not public doesn't mean this shouldn't matter to you.
570
And in fact, I can imagine someone who has an activist bent being particularly excited about bringing a case against a private, large unicorn.
571
You're certainly influencing it there.
572
I can tell you this: I've had a couple companies ask me in the wake of that whether or not they should be reincorporating.
573
So I think there is a movement afoot.
574
Something else we talked about in relation to corporate governance, Bill, on a prior pod, and this is these proxy advisors, ISS and Glass Lewis, right?
575
They have a monopoly on giving advice, particularly to passive shareholders, about how they should vote their shares in the annual vote.
576
And we've come to discover that they're probably not the best and most objective when it comes to doing it, or they may have political agendas that are misaligned with your own.
577
Senator Haggerty had a tweet yesterday that caught my eye.
578
He said the two largest proxy advisors have 97% market share.
579
They wield control over millions and millions of votes.
580
They've hijacked corporate governance, and an investigation into their anti-competitive and abusive practices is long overdue.
581
I hadn't heard about this in a few months, but any reactions to that?
582
Yeah, I don't know if you remember, but when we did an episode early on about stock-based comp, and before that, I had reached out to ISS to talk about how they come up with their different philosophies.
583
And it was very clear to me that there was no one there thinking from a first principles perspective about what are the types of policies or actions that a board could take, that a comp committee could take that would align interests with shareholders.
584
And I would think that if you run a large index fund, if you're BlackRock or whatever, and you're voting your shares for or against different policies, that the number one thing you should care about, perhaps the only thing you should care about, is whether they're looking after the interest of shareholders.
585
And we clearly crept away from that in the past 10 or 20 years.
586
The senator that you're talking about said when he was given this talk that these two companies are now both over 80% owned outside the U.S.
587
And that they both have corporate philosophies that extend beyond what we just talked about.
588
Which,, I've always, I grew up in the school that fiduciary duty is the number one responsibility of all board members, and that means looking after the shareholders.
589
And so I think that two things should happen.
590
First, I do wonder, and this would be a question for the senator,, why are so many companies paying attention to what these people say?
591
Are they just loyal?
592, are they just lazy?
593
Do they not want to do the work themselves?
594
And admittedly, if you run an index fund, you're on thin margins, so maybe you don't have time.
595
But they should wake up and realize that they're not solely looking after the interests of their shareholders and they have other interests in mind.
596
And ironically, and this gets back to policy, one of the key reasons so many companies have super voting is so that these two companies can't tell them what to do.
597
And so,, it's ironic because most people think of super voting shares as being less good governance,, a lesser form of good governance.
598
But if these companies that are measuring you and telling,, index investors how to vote aren't looking after shareholder interests, then you may need to take that step precisely to get away from them.
599
And so I would encourage,, the BlackRocks and all the ETF people to not just simply vote with what these people say.
600
And maybe what we need, maybe we need an alternative to these two things.
601
You and I have talked about SBC.
602, I think there's a number of things you could use AI that you would put into a model to say, what is the type of good governance that aligns shareholder interests?
603
And maybe it'd be good to see something that pop up.
604
I love it.
605
I love it.
606
Let's incubate that, Bill.
607
Okay.
608
Let's incubate that.
609
Anyone out there, let's find some of the guys who are playing the AI founders and engineers who were playing in the altimeter poker game last night.
610
They were looking for ideas.
611
This is a great one.
612
Okay.
613
Well, I would encourage any of our listeners, there may be someone already doing it that's already working on an alternative to these two companies.
614
And if you are, reach out to us.
615
We could help fund it, help promote it.
616
And it'd be exciting to see.
617
Yeah, no, that'd be great.
618
Well, it's been another good one, buddy.
619
Great seeing you.
620
Until next time.
621
Take care.
