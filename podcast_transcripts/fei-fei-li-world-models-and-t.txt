1
That space, the 3D space, the space out there, the space in your mind's eye, the spatial intelligence that enable people to do so many things that's beyond language is a critical part of intelligence.
2
Feyn leans over to me.
3
She's like, you know what we're missing?
4
I said, what are we missing?
5
She said, we're missing a world, mom.
6
I'm like, yes.
7
We can actually create infinite universes.
8
Some are for robots, some are for creativity, some are for socialization, some are for travel, some are for storytelling.
9
It suddenly will enable us to live in a multiverse way.
10
The imagination is boundless.
11
When we talk about AI today, the conversation is dominated by language.
12
LLMs, tokens, prompts.
13
But what if we're missing something more fundamental?
14
Not words, but space.
15
The physical world we move through in shape.
16
My guests today think we are.
17
Fei Fei Lee, a pioneer in modern AI, helped usher in the deep learning era by putting data at the center of machine learning.
18
Now she's co-founder and CEO of World Labs, Building World Models, AI systems that perceive and act in 3D space.
19
She's joined by A16Z general partner Martine Casado, computer scientist, repeat founder, and one of the first people Feifei called when forming the company.
20
Today, they explain why spatial intelligence is core to general intelligence and why it's time to go beyond language.
21
Let's get into it.

25
Fey, thank you so much for joining us here.
26
Martin, why don't you really brag on behalf of Feife a little bit?
27
And how would you summarize her contributions to AI for people unfamiliar?
28
Yeah, someone that doesn't need a lot of introduction, and she's done so many things that I can't fill in.
29
So maybe I'll just do the ones that's appropriate to this.
30
Of course, she was on the Twitter board.
31
She was a Google tech.
32
Founder and CEO of World Labs.
33
But very, very importantly, like we all know AI and we all talk about kind of neural networks and there's a number of people that focused on making those effective.
34
But Feife really singularly brought in data to the equation, which now we're recognizing is actually probably the bigger problem, the more interesting one.
35
And so she truly is the godmother of AI, as everybody calls her.
36
And Feife, why did you have to have Martine as the first investor?
37
Well, first of all, I knew Martin for more than a decade.
38
You know, I joined Stanford in 2009 as a young assistant professor, and Martin was finishing his PhD there.
39
So I always know, and of course, Martine's advisor, Nick McHugh, was a good friend.
40
And I always know Martin Wenton to become a very successful entrepreneur and very successful investor.
41
So we see each other, we talk about things.
42
But as I was formulating the idea of World Labs, I was looking for what I would call my unicorn investor.
43
I don't know if that's a word, but that's how I talked about this.
44
Who is not only obviously a very established and successful investor who can be with entrepreneurs on this journey through the ups and downs, who can be very insightful, who can bring a kind of knowledge, advice, resource, but I was also particularly looking for an intellectual partner.
45
Because what we are doing at World Labs is very deep tech.
46
We are trying to do something no one else has done.
47
We know with a lot of conviction it will change the world.
48
But I need someone who is a computer scientist, who is a student of AI, understand product, market, commerce, go-to-market, and just can be on the phone or in person with me every moment of the day as an intellectual partner.
49
And here we are.
50
We talk almost every single day.
51
It is true.
52
Yeah.
53
Amazing.
54
Actually, the origin story of us first connecting is actually pretty interesting.
55
So Vivi has clearly been thinking about this idea for a very long time, like well before I started, so maybe years even.
56
And she has this very deep intuition of what AI needs in order to basically navigate the world, right?
57
But we were at one of Mark's fancy lunches, and there's a bunch of AI people, and everybody was so excited about LLMs, right?
58
And it was talking about language.
59
And I come to this independent conclusion just because I've actually done a lot of image investing that like that wasn't the end of the story.
60
And so if I remember at the end of this table, all these people talking about it.
61
And Vivi leans over to me and she's like, you know what we're missing?
62
I said, what are we missing?
63
She said, we're missing a world model.
64
And I'm like, yes.
65
And it fell into place then because I've been like thinking about stuff at a high level.
66
But as she does, she just kind of perfectly articulated this.
67
So she had a year's worth of thinking about this and talked to people, et cetera.
68
And so in some way, we kind of in our own crooked past had arrived at a very similar intuition.
69
Hers was like way more filled out.
70
Mine was just this kind of fancy thing.
71
But then after that, we actually had a number of conversations where we both agreed that we were aligned on this kind of idea.
72
Actually, I don't know if you know this.
73
So of course, during that lunch, we hit it off on this world model idea.
74
But I was at that point already talking to various people, not just computer scientists, technologists, but also investors, potentially business partners.
75
And to be honest, most people didn't get it.
76
You know, when I say world model, they nod.
77
So I called Martin, I'm like, do you mind coming over to Stanford campus and have coffee with me?
78
Cup of coffee.
79
And then as soon as Martin came and sat down, I said, Martin, can you define your world model to me?
80
I really wanted to hear if Martin actually meant it.
81
And the way he defined it about an AI model that truly understands the 3D structure, shape, and the compositionality of the world was exactly what I was talking about.
82
And I was like, wow, he's the only person so far I've talked to who actually meant it.
83
It's not just nodding.
84
Wow.
85
Okay, so we're going to get to World Labs and the specifics of this.
86
But first, I want to take you back both to your PhD days, your professor days, and reflect on if you could go back in time and sort of have knowledge of what's happened the preceding 10 years in AI, what do you think would have been the biggest surprises?
87
Or was the thing that you didn't see coming that would have shocked your younger self?
88
Or did you have a good sense of how this field is going to play out?
89
Yeah, it's ironic to say because, as Martin said, I was the person who brought data into the AI world, but I still continue to be so surprised-not surprised intellectually, but surprised emotionally that the data-hungry models, the data-driven AI, can come this far and genuinely have incredible emergent behaviors of thinking machine, right?
90
Yeah.
91
Let's get into the specifics.
92
Why start another foundation model company?
93
Why aren't LLMs?
94
Why not?
95
My intellectual journey is not about company or papers, it's about finding the North Star problem.
96
So it's not like I woke up.
97
I woke up every day, day after day for the past few years, thinking that there is so much more than language.
98
Language is an incredibly powerful encoding of thoughts and information, but it's actually not a powerful encoding of what the 3D physical world that all animals and living things live in.
99
And if you look at human intelligence, so much is beyond the realm of language.
100
Language is a lossy way to capture the world.
101
And also, one subtlety of language is purely generative.
102
Language doesn't exist in nature.
103
We look around, there's not a syllabus or word.
104
Whereas the entire physical, perceptual, visual world is there.
105
And animals' entire evolutionary history is built upon so much perceptual and eventually embody intelligence.
106
Humans, not only we survive, live, work, but we build civilization beyond language, upon constructing the world and changing the world.
107
So that's the problem I want to tackle.
108
And in order to tackle that problem, obviously research was important and I spent years doing that as an academic.
109
And it's still fun, but I do realize, and especially talking to Martine, that the time has come that concentrated industry-grade effort, focused effort in terms of compute, data, talent is really the answer to bringing this to life.
110
And that's why I wanted to start World Labs.
111
Amazing.
112
So if I put you in a room and I blindfolded you and I just described the room and then I asked you to do a task, the chances of you being able to do it are very little.
113
I'm like, oh, 10 foot in front of you is like a cup.
114
And like, you know, like this, it's just, it's this very inaccurate way to convey reality because reality is so complex and it's so exact, right?
115
On the other hand, if I took off the blindfold and you can see the actual space, right?
116
And what your brain is doing is actually reconstructing the 3D, right?
117
Then you can actually go and manipulate things and touch things, right?
118
And so one way to think about it is we do a lot of language processing and we use that to communicate and the high-level ideas, et cetera.
119
But when it comes to navigating the actual world, we really, really rely on the world itself and our ability to reconstruct that.
120
And how and when did you realize that language weren't enough?
121
Because it seems like it's not super widely known.
122
I don't hear about this all the time.
123
Well, Sydney, if you ask me, like, what is this surprising breakthrough?
124
It's that language went first because we've worked so hard on robotics, right?
125
I mean, I feel like even look at autonomous vehicles as an industry, we've invested like $100 billion in it.
126
I remember when Sebastian Thrun like actually won like the DARPA Grand Challenge in 2006 and we're like, hooray, AV is done, right?
127
And then 20 years later, like we're finally there, $100 billion in, et cetera.
128
This is like a 2D problem.
129
And so that was the path we were going on: is do you actually solve like world navigation?
130
And it's hard.
131
And then out of nowhere comes these LLMs.
132
And they are unit economic positive.
133
They solve all of these language problems like basically immediately.
134
And so it just took me a moment.
135
I actually Feyfay said it beautifully early on when we were talking, which is the part of our brain.
136
And so we're actually pretty inefficient at it, right?
137
And so the fact that a computer does it better is not super surprising.
138
But the part of the brain that actually does the navigation, you know, the spatial has been around, it's a million brains.
139
Maybe the reptilian brains, what, four million years?
140
Well, it's even more than that.
141
It's a trilobite break.
142
Yeah, yeah, right.
143
Triloby had break.
144
Right.
145
500 million years.
146
Yeah.
147
So it's almost like we're unrolling evolution, right?
148
So the language part is actually very, very important for like high-level concepts and like the laptop class type work, which is what it's impacting right now.
149
But when it comes to space, and this is everything from robotics to anything where you're trying to construct something physical, you have to solve this problem.
150
And then we know from A-B that it's a very tough problem.
151
And then maybe this is what is worth talking about.
152
Like the generative wave gave us some insight in how you might want to do it.
153
So it really felt like that was the time.
154
My journey is very different because I've always been in vision, right?
155
So I feel like I didn't need LLM to convince me LWM is important.
156
I do want to say we're not here bashing language.
157
I'm just so excited.
158
In fact, seeing ChatGPT and LLMs and these foundation models having such breakthrough success inspires us to realize the moment is closer for world models.
159
But Martin said it so beautifully.
160
It's that space, the 3D space, the space out there, the space in your mind's eye, the spatial intelligence that enable people to do so many things that are beyond language is a critical part of intelligence.
161
It goes from ancient animals all the way to humanity's most innovative findings, such as the structure of DNA, right?
162
That double helix in 3D space.
163
There's no way you can use language a lot.
164
Another one of my favorite scientific examples is buckyball.
165
Carbon molecule structure that is so beautifully constructed.
166
That kind of example shows how incredibly profound space and 3D world is.
167
Let's paint even more of a picture.
168
When World Labs has achieved its vision or Language One Law has achieved their vision, what are some applications or use cases that we can present to the audience to help make it concrete?
169
Yeah, there is a lot, right?
170
For example, creativity is very visual.
171
We have creators from design to movie to architecture to industry design.
172
Creativity is not just only for entertainment.
173
It could be for productivity, for machinery, for many things.
174
That alone is a highly visual, perceptual, spatial area or areas of work.
175
Of course, we mentioned robotics.
176
Robotics to me is any embodied machines.
177
It's not just humanoids or cars.
178
There's so much in between, but all of them have to somehow figure out the 3D space it lives in, have to be trained to understand the 3D space and have to do things, sometimes even collaboratively with humans.
179
And that needs spatial intelligence.
180
And of course, I think one thing that's very exciting for me is that for the entirety of human civilization, we all collectively, as people, lived in one 3D world, and that is the physical Earth 3D world.
181
A few of us went to the moon, but you know, very small number.
182
With this technology, which we should talk about, it's the combination of generation and reconstruction.
183
Suddenly, we can actually create infinite universes.
184
Some are for robots, some are for creativity, some are for socialization, some are for travel, some are for storytelling.
185
It suddenly will enable us to live in a multiverse way.
186
The imagination is boundless.
187
I think it's very important because these conversations can sound abstract, but they're actually not.
188
But the reason they sound abstract is because it's truly horizontal, just like LLMs are, right?
189
So, like maybe I say, like, what are LLMs good at?
190
The same LLM we use for like an emotional conversation.
191
We use it to write code.
192
We use to do lists.
193
We use it for self-actualization, right?
194
And so, I think we can get actually pretty concrete about what these models do, right?
195
And so, let me just give it a shot.
196
And then, Fabia is the expert, of course.
197
So, with these models, you can take a view of the world, like a 2D view of the world, and then you can actually create a 3D full representation, including what you're not seeing, like the back of the table, for example, within the computer.
198
So, given just a 2D view, you have the full thing, and then you ask, okay, well, what can you do with that thing, for example?
199
Well, you can manipulate it, you can move it, you can measure it, you can stack it.
200
So, anything that you would do is space you could do, right?
201
That means you could do architecture, you could do design.
202
But it turns out the ability to fill out the back of the table means that you can fill out stuff that was never there to begin with, right?
203
So, let's say that I just had a 2D picture of this.
204
I could create a 360 of everything, right?
205
And so, now you have fully generative.
206
And so, what does that mean?
207
That means that's video games, that's creativity.
208
And so, it's a super horizontal piece that takes basically a computer with a single view.
209
And so, you can see that that's a very concrete, pivotal thing from everything from like robotics to video games to art and design.
210
Yeah.
211
It seems like we haven't fully been appreciating sort of 3D components until now.
212
Is that fair to say?
213
It is fair to say.
214
In fact, I think it took evolution a long time.
215
3D is not an easy problem, but I always come back to the fact that I had a conversation with my six-year-old years ago about why trees don't have eyes.
216
And the fundamental thing is trees don't move.
217
They don't need eyes.
218
So, the fact that the entire basis of animal life is moving and doing things and interacting gives life to perception and spatial intelligence.
219
And in turn, spatial intelligence is going to reinvent horizontally, as Martin said, so many of the ways of work and life that humans are doing.
220
Yeah, fascinating.
221
But it is definitely worth asking the question: why can't you just use 2D video for this, right?
222
Like, 3D is very, very fundamental to this.
223
Vivi, you suggested let's get deeper into the technology.
224
What can we share more about how it works or what the breakthrough is, or what's worth commenting on the technology?
225
To Martine's point, does it need to be 3D or why can't you just use 2D?
226
I think you can do a lot of things using 2D.
227
But the fact is that 2D won't get you very far.
228
In fact, today's multimodal LLMs is already making a big difference in the robotic learning world, helping guiding you to know what's next, the state of the world.
229
But fundamentally, physics happens.
230
Navigating behind the back of the table needs to happen in 3D.
231
Composing the world, whether physically, digitally, needs to happen in 3D.
232
So, fundamentally, the problem is a 3D problem.
233
One way to think about it is: if it's a human being looking at, say, a 2D video, the human being can reconstruct the 3D in their head, right?
234
But let's say I've got a robot that has the output of the model.
235
If that's 2D, and then you ask the robot to do, I don't know, distance or to grab something, that information is missing.
236
You've got the XYZ plane, the Z-plane just isn't there at all, right?
237
And so, for many things that are spatial, you need to provide that information to the computer so that you can actually navigate in 3D space.
238
And so, 2D video is great if it's a human because we already can turn it into 3D, but like for any computer program, it'll need to be 3D.
239
Actually, I want to tell you a personal story.
240
About five years ago, ironically, I lost my stereo vision for a few months because I had a cornea injury.
241
And that means I was literally seeing with one eye.
242
And like Martin said, my whole life has been trained with stereo vision.
243
So, even if I was seen with one eye, I kind of know what the 3D world looked like.
244
But it was a fascinating period as a computer vision scientist for me to experiment what the world is.
245
And one thing that truly drove home literally was I was frightened to drive.
246
Wow.
247
First of all, I couldn't get on highway.
248
That speed, I could not, you know.
249
But I was just driving in my own neighborhood, and I realized I don't have a good distance measure between my car and the parked car on a local small road.
250
Even though I have a perfect understanding of how big is my car almost, how big is the neighbors, the parked cars, I know the roads for years and years, but just driving there, I had to be so slow, like almost 10 miles an hour, so that I don't scratch the cars.
251
And that was exactly why we needed stereo vision.
252
That's actually a great articulation of why 3D is just actually key if you're doing some processing, right?
253
Yeah, so I don't recommend it, but you can park your car one and drive your car two with one eye and feel it.
254
That's your own car.
255
On the tech side, with LLMs, a lot of the research was done at the big companies.
256
What's the state of the research here?
257
This is definitely a newer area of research compared to LLM.
258
It's not totally fair to say new because in computer vision as a field, we have been doing bits and pieces.
259
For example, one important revolution that has happened in 3D computer vision was Neuradian Field or NERF.
260
And that was done by our co-founder, Ben Mildenhall and his colleagues at Berkeley.
261
And that was a way to do 3D reconstruction using deep learning that was really taking the world by storm about four years ago.
262
We've also got a co-founder, Christoph Lasner, whose pioneering work was part of the reason Gaussian Splat representation started to, again, become really popular as a way to represent volumetric 3D.
263
And of course, Justin Johnson, who was my former student, also co-founder of World Labs, were among the first generation of deep learning computer vision students who did so much foundational work in image generation when before Transformer were out, we were using gas to do image generation and then style transfer, which was really popularized some of the components or ingredients of what we're doing here.
264
So things were happening in academia, things were happening in industry.
265
But I agree what is exciting now is that at World Lab, we just have the conviction that we're going to be all in on this one singular big North Star problem, concentrating on the world's smartest people in computer vision, in diffusion models, in computer graphics, in optimization, in AI, in data, all of them coming into this one team and try to make this work and to productize this.
266
I will say from an outsider standpoint, and so I'm not an expert in any of these spaces, but it really feels like to solve this problem, you need experts both in AI, and that's like the data and the models, like the actual model architecture, and graphics, which is like how do you actually represent these things in memory in a computer and then on the screen.
267
So it takes a very special team to actually crack this problem, which Feyfe has managed to put together.
268
Well, that's an inspiring note.
269
