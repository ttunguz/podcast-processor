1
You should always try to raise money from the best tier one VCs, even if the terms are slightly worse.
2
Because so much signaling.
3
It's harder to raise 3 million than it is to raise 100 million.
4
But I can guarantee you, Duolingo would not have been able to raise any money in Europe.
5
You know, we had $0 revenue for the first five years.
6
How much was the series in?
7
$3 million at 15, yeah.
8
I think we only had one offer.
9
It was Unisquare or back to university.
10
This is 20 VC with me, Harry Stebbies.
11
Now, for years, I've been battling with one of my dear friends, Nico Wittenborn at Adjacent, that consumer subscription does not yield mega, mega outcomes.
12
Well, I've just come to the conclusion that I have really lost this debate.
13
And the guest today proves that I am wrong.
14
Duolingo is a $24 billion market cap company today with 100 million monthly active users.
15
And joining me in the hot seat is their co-founder, Severin Hacker.
16
This is such a wide-ranging discussion on everything from how AI changes the future of education, companies, to how to pick your life partner and the decline of Europe.
17
Now, that is topic breadth for you.
18
But before we dive into the show today, I love seeing the team come together to make this show happen.
19
What I don't love is trying to keep track of all the information, the data, and the projects that we're working on across dozens of platforms, products, and tools.
20
That's why we use Coda, the all-in-one collaborative workspace that's helped 50,000 teams all over the world get on the same page.
21
Offering the flexibility of docs with the structure of spreadsheets, Coda facilitates deeper teamwork and quicker creativity.
22
And their turnkey AI solution, the intelligence of Coda Brain, is a game changer.
23
Powered by Grammarly, Coda is entering a new phase of innovation and expansion, aiming to redefine productivity for the AI era.
24
Whether you're a startup looking to organize the chaos while staying nimble, or an enterprise organization looking for better opportunities.
25
Its seamless workspace connects to hundreds of your favorite tools, including Salesforce, Jira, Asana, and Figma, helping your teams transform their rituals and do more faster.
26
Head over to coda.io/slash 20vc right now and get six months off the team plan for startups for free.
27
That's codacoda.io slash 20vc, and get six months off the team plan for free, coda.io/slash 20vc.
28
And while coda keeps the engine running smoothly, Shopify puts the pedal to the metal when it's time to sell.
29
When I was 18, I dreamed about being an investor with zero contacts in the industry, and through persistence, I'm now living that dream.
30
Maybe you're dreaming of your own business, and that's where Shopify steps in.
31
I spend my time exploring successful businesses online.
32
Often, there's a business behind the business driving success.
33
For millions, that's Shopify, powering 10% of US commerce.
34
Shopify offers beautiful templates, AI tools for product images and descriptions, easy marketing campaigns, and 24/7 support.
35
Their number one checkout boosts conversions by 50%.
36
Fewer abandoned carts, more sales.
37
Winner, turn dreams into success with Shopify.
38
Go to shopify.com/slash 20vc for your $1 per month trial today.
39
That's shopify.com/slash 20vc.
40
And while Shopify helps you drive sales, trust is the ultimate currency in business, and today customers expect it faster than ever.
41
And that's why over 10,000 global companies trust Vanta.
42
Vanta automates up to 90% of the work for in-demand compliance standards like SOT2, ISO 27001, and more, using smart AI to centralize workflows, manage risk, and get you audit ready in weeks, not months.
43
So you can stop chasing paperwork and start closing deals.
44
And a new IDC report found that Vanta customers achieve $535,000 per year in benefits.
45
That's insane.
46
And the platform pays for itself in three months.
47
I had no idea about these.
48
Whether you're growing fast or just getting started, Vanta connects you with trusted auditors and experts, support to help you build trust with customers.
49
Get $1,000 off your first year at vanta.com forward slash 20VC.
50
That's vanta.com forward slash 20vc.
51
You have now arrived at your destination.
52
Severin, I'm so excited for this dude.
53
I had Lewis on six or seven years ago.
54
I've heard so many great things before this show from Miami Bing, from KP, Brad now, but from USV, many others.
55
So thank you so much for doing this.
56
Thank you.
57
Thank you for having me.
58
I would love to start though with the news of the day.
59
I don't mind the whole context of like telling your life story and normal podcast intros.
60
Duolingo came out as being AI first the other day.
61
What does that mean?
62
And what does that not mean?
63
So people have a clear understanding.
64
Okay, so maybe taking a step back.
65
Why did we start Duolingo?
66
What is our mission?
67
Duolingo's mission is to provide the best education and make it universally available.
68
That's why Louis and I started this company.
69
In the past, the best education was only available to the richest people, the kings, the head, you know, the private tutors for their kids.
70
That was the way to learn.
71
And by the way, this is still true today.
72
If you want to become the best tennis player, you hire a one-on-one tennis coach.
73
You actually see this.
74
I remember there was a U.S.
75
Open final, I think it was, and the two female players in the final were both daughters of billionaires.
76
Yeah, exactly.
77
So, you know, they got the one-on-one tutor.
78
When we started Duolingo, we saw the potential of technology to do this, but for everyone.
79
We can't all afford these one-on-one tutors.
80
That's too expensive.
81
But with technology, there's a way that anyone can have access to a one-on-one tutor with the same efficacy.
82
And that's why we started Duolingo.
83
From day one, it was technology first.
84
Back then, it was software.
85
Now we call it AI.
86
So, in a way, not much has changed, except AI has become a lot better.
87
Take me to that discussion then, where you're inside the room with Lewis and the board, and you decide: okay, we need to fundamentally change how we do everything and reshape the organization of this company towards being an AI-driven company.
88
This has been going on for the last two and a half years.
89
So, we were one of the launch partners of OpenAI when they first launched Chip T4, and we immediately saw the potential of this technology to help our mission.
90
What was it that you saw that gave you such optimism?
91
When you first had access to it, it was impressive.
92
It was like an iPhone moment.
93
You just realized this is the future.
94
We're going to use this everywhere.
95
And then it's like the second question: how do you use this at Duolingo?
96
And the first thing we realized is this can really help us accelerate content production.
97
In the past, it would always take us a long time to produce new courses.
98
But then with AI, there's a potential that you can pump out a lot of these courses all at once.
99
In fact, we just did that.
100
You know, it took us 12 years to build the first 100 courses or so.
101
And now, within one year, we built another 148 courses.
102
It would have taken us decades to build this.
103
How are you using AI to then 12x content creation within Duolingo?
104
By the way, there's a lot of these short sentences, the ones you see in the lessons.
105
And those are now produced with AI.
106
There's also this concept of viability.
107
You want to introduce new words one at a time, and you can give these constraints to the AI.
108
It's like, create a sentence that uses these words, doesn't use any of the other words, and only uses these grammar concepts.
109
And it can do that.
110
And that's how we've been able to generate the sentence content within these courses.
111
With respect to the curriculum design, when you look at completion rates of students and you have the data that you have, in six months, would it not be better to let AI do curriculum design, knowing all of the completion rates, success rates, satisfaction rates, NPS scores, to actually build that curriculum itself?
112
The industry is definitely moving that way.
113
One of the most amazing things about Duolingo is that we have this massive user base.
114
We're by far the largest learning platform out there, by far.
115
Orders of magnitude.
116
We see how people learn.
117
It's like the largest school.
118
Usually in education, the studies were done with 20 to 30 students.
119
We have hundreds of millions.
120
That allows us to look at: okay, does this curriculum design work versus this versus that?
121
And we can use that data to improve the curriculum design itself.
122
But not only that, so right now we still have these courses and your curriculum is the same as mine.
123
But really, I think the future is going to be quite different.
124
Where you say, you might be interested in rugby and you have a trip planned to, I don't know, France.
125
I think France also is big into rugby.
126
And you could then custom design a course just for you.
127
They use exactly the vocabulary you want to use when you go to France.
128
It could be completely different from mine.
129
Why do we even create this batch on the back end?
130
Why don't we create it on the fly when you need it?
131
I think that's part of the reason why these one-on-one tutors are so good because they know where you are.
132
They're really good at assessment.
133
Think of the tennis coach again.
134
They know where you are, they know where you need to go, and they're very good at giving you the feedback.
135
And they also know how you differ from other players.
136
I was actually watching Zach last night on an interview, and he was saying the future of content is not passive consumption of videos like we have today.
137
It's the interactivity where you will talk to the video, and suddenly, the fitness trainer will actually say, Oh, no, you should have 12 grams of protein, not eight grams of protein.
138
And it's that interactivity that will drive it.
139
How do you think about personalization balanced with interactivity in the future of content and the future of education?
140
To what extent is it multimodal?
141
You know, a thing I love about Duolingo that makes me sound weird as anything is: I'm walking around London and then I'm going, Bruno, esse medicano.
142
And it's multimodal.
143
It's my voice playing back, it's me typing.
144
There's many different modes.
145
Yeah, yeah, I think it's going to be multimodal.
146
We have this feature inside the app called Video Call with Lily.
147
So, you can call Lily.
148
Lily's one of our characters.
149
She's the one with the purple hair.
150
She's not a one-on-one tutor, she's more like a friend, but she remembers stuff.
151
So, she remembers, for example, that you know that I like cooking, she knows where I live, et cetera, et cetera.
152
She personalizes in that way, but it's full conversation.
153
So, you learn by conversing with an AI friend.
154
And I think that's going to be super important.
155
How has the way that you build internally in Duolingo changed with AI?
156
What tools do you use?
157
How has it changed cadence?
158
How has that changed?
159
We use AI in three ways at Duolingo.
160
Number one is content generation, and that's where we've seen the biggest success.
161
Number two is AI features.
162
Two years ago or three years ago, you couldn't build.
163
Now you can do it.
164
And it's actually the thing that was lacking in the product.
165
If you ask our users what's missing in Duolingo, it's like this conversational piece, like speaking.
166
I want to get better at speaking.
167
And now we can do this.
168
And it's a really, really, really powerful feature.
169
Great adoption with this video called Lily feature.
170
And I think there's more to be done there, both making this feature better, but then also maybe there's new AI features that we can have built.
171
And the third is overall productivity improvements across the company.
172
Software engineers using cursor, using AI for customer support.
173
Can't you mandate cursor?
174
Do you say, hey, we prefer you to use this or this?
175
How do you do that?
176
We don't mandate.
177
Duolingo is surprisingly egalitarian, and we just say, use the AI tool or use whatever makes you more productive, and we pay for it.
178
You can use cursor, you can use ChatGPT, you can use Copilot, and then we see what people actually use.
179
Where is AI much better than people?
180
And where is it not as good as people think?
181
And actually has quite a lot of room to improve.
182
You know, early on, there were a lot of these hallucinations, the AI making stuff up.
183
I think they have gone down, number one.
184
But then also, number two, for us, it's not a problem if they hallucinate because we teach languages.
185
As long as the language is grammatically correct, it is okay.
186
You know, if it makes up a historical fact, we don't teach history.
187
It's like hallucinations are not a problem for our use case.
188
I bet you have users, though, that are like, no, it was 1914, not 1916.
189
Yeah, we don't go that far into it.
190
But when you have so many users, you're like, there's always one.
191
Yeah.
192
No, so the hallucinations are not a problem.
193
I think there's a lot of Silicon Valley hyperbole around software engineering getting.
194
I try all of these tools, and I think there's still a lot they can't do well.
195
What can they not do well?
196
On the software engineering side, I think what they're really good at is going from zero to 80% for a simple app, the replic, the lovable.
197
And then the larger the code base gets, the worse they get.
198
Adding the next 10% takes as long as the first 80%.
199
And they kind of create their own tech debt, which they also cannot really solve.
200
And then the other thing they're really good at is just isolated transformations.
201
So in a single file, add all the comments or change a function to use different input parameters or something like that.
202
Really good at that.
203
What they're not good at is large code bases and adding a feature, even a simple one, to a large code base.
204
Do you think you will have more or less software engineers in five years' time at Duolingo?
205
You know, if you had asked me a year ago, I would have said 100% more.
206
Now I'm a little bit less certain.
207
But I think two things will change.
208
So in a way, what these AI tools do is they lower the entry level to get into a software engineer, right?
209
So your mom can maybe build an app with Lovable or something like that.
210
She has to.
211
Right.
212
Okay, right.
213
So there you go.
214
The other thing it does, it just lowers the cost of lines of code producing software.
215
And then there's the Jervins paradox, which says the cost of a good goes down, you will actually have more demand for it.
216
I also believe some of this will be true.
217
So I think there will be a lot more people writing apps.
218
Whether they will actually touch the code or not, I'm not sure.
219
And then I think the second thing is like, are we going to call them software engineers or what are we going to call them?
220
One thing we see is inside Duolingo, we have the three biggest functions within Duolingo are product, engineering, and design.
221
But with AI, you can see that there's maybe like a new role, kind of a product engineer designer, like one person who can do all of these roles to a certain degree.
222
They can build a prototype, and then maybe at some point they need to hand it off to an actual software engineer or an actual designer.
223
That's going to be part of the future.
224
So I think it's going to be more software, a lot more software, a lot more people creating software.
225
Whether we're going to call them software engineers or not, I'm not sure.
226
And then I think there's going to be this convergence of roles of product, engineer, and design.
227
So for everyone coming out of university state or contemplating university courses stay and who are told, I'll CS in five years' time, it's not going to be worth it.
228
If I was your little brother and I'm 18 and I'm like, help me, Severin, should I do CS at university?
229
What would you say?
230
So I did my CS degree.
231
It's now quite a while ago.
232
They don't actually teach you coding.
233
People think like, oh, CS means coding.
234
What they teach you is kind of the fundamentals of not even software engineering, but like how computers work.
235
And then computer science is kind of applied mathematics.
236
Okay, so I do believe there's still a lot of value in thinking logically, which is something that the best CS courses teach you.
237
They don't teach you Java or Python.
238
And they shouldn't.
239
I think that part is going to go away.
240
Like all the details of actual coding.
241
But the fundamentals of problem solving, that will still be available.
242
And so should I do it?
243
I would say for the next five years, probably still a good investment.
244
Yeah.
245
You know, like, there's like, okay, so if you extrapolate, okay, so once we have full AGI, we no longer have jobs.
246
Nobody has to work anymore.
247
We have UBI, et cetera.
248
Maybe it's going to be next 10 years if you really see a broad adoption of these technologies.
249
More likely, maybe 20 years or so.
250
Today, in the US, if you run into a stranger at the conference, the first question is usually, what do you do?
251
But in this future world, the first question might be like, what are your hobbies?
252
You know, like, because we don't have jobs anymore.
253
So everything is going to be like about not work.
254
I do just question it, though.
255
I think we can quite often get a little bit overexcited.
256
And it's like, you know, when you had the agricultural revolution, it's like, oh my God, we had 100 people in a field, and now we have this combine harvester, we have one person driving it.
257
We're all going to have no jobs.
258
We have computers and calculators.
259
What are accountants going to do?
260
And people can do when we have.
261
We always find a next thing to do.
262
The idea that society will live in this UBI lack of utility state, I hope is not true.
263
The other thing that is interesting about this is, this is more on a philosophical note, is if you just ask people, you know, did you like your job?
264
You can ask anyone here.
265
They all love their job.
266
You love your job.
267
I'm sure you love your job.
268
You would do it for less money.
269
Dude, I did it for free.
270
You would do it for me.
271
Yeah, I would.
272
I literally get paid to hang out with amazing people.
273
Like, are you kidding me?
274
Yeah.
275
So for us, it's not just income, right?
276
It's purpose.
277
We derive purpose from our job.
278
But for a lot of people, the job is just, they do it for income.
279
They don't derive purpose from it.
280
The people that derive purpose from their job, who work the most, et cetera, the tech people and the investors and all of these people close to the AI revolution, I think we are most afraid of it because we feel we might lose.
281
So I had Jason Landkin, who's a very famous SaaS investor on the show recently.
282
And he said, the hard thing is with young people, they just don't want to work.
283
Fundamentally, they don't want to work.
284
And AI is as good as they are at sales, at marketing, whether you're an SDR, whether you're a social media content creator for memes or GIFs or whatever it is.
285
And so in 12 months, we're going to see huge, huge unemployment in this kind of lower-level tech employee.
286
And it's going to happen.
287
Do you think that's true?
288
I'm not sure.
289
So here's another thing: the general consensus is that these AI tools are really good for senior software engineers or staff-level software engineers, right?
290
Yeah, they have been trained and now they can use AI and they become much more productive.
291
They're now a 10x engineer.
292
The general consensus is that AI can do the job of an entry-level engineer.
293
Therefore, let's stop hiring entry-level engineers and only hire senior engineers.
294
But I think that's a mistake.
295
And we're actually not doing that at Duolingo.
296
We still hire from universities.
297
One of the reasons is we believe the people that grow up with these tools and start using these tools early will become much better at using them.
298
So in a way, yes, they're.
299
Why is that?
300
Because young people have more plastic minds to new tools and new processes.
301
What's the thinking behind that?
302
I think it's just like, I bet the person who spent a thousand hours using ChatGPT is a lot better at using it than I am.
303
And I think that that's the case for the new grads.
304
You know, Duolingo wouldn't be where it is today in terms of our social media presence if we never hired from Gen Z.
305
It's like you need to know your target demographic.
306
And Zarya, who was on your show before, she's Gen Z and then without.
307
She just fundamentally understands it in a way.
308
It's like, why is this funny?
309
Why do people watch this?
310
But it's super, super popular.
311
Yeah, you're not Gen Z anymore, Sabrina.
312
I'm sorry, dude.
313
You don't even fit in our demographic.
314
We mentioned that how it changes engineering, product design.
315
Another big area is customer support.
316
And we chatted about it a little bit before.
317
How does AI change customer support processes and workloads within Duolingo?
318
Yeah, so we started using an AI tool for customer support.
319
I think it's another one of these early applications of AI where AI can really do a great job and transform an industry.
320
We have found for a lot of the, you know, AI can do 70 to 80% of the tickets that we get.
321
And then people always say, oh, well, okay, you guys, you don't need human customer support agents anymore.
322
That's not true because you still have the other 30% or so.
323
But then not only that, now that you have this kind of like an unlimited AI customer support agent, you can actually give customer support to a much broader base.
324
So far, we only give it to our subscribers, the ones that pay for Duolingo.
325
But if we can, you know, reduce the cost of customer support by 10x or 100x, then we can actually give it to everyone.
326
Classic, classic example of Turbin's paradox, right?
327
So as cost goes down, demand goes up.
328
Who do you use for customer support?
329
We use Decagon.
330
Yeah.
331
I would love to have their CEO on the show.
332
I think it'd be a fascinating one on the future of customers.
333
Well, you know what?
334
I'd love to.
335
I'd love to do a panel with a couple of different providers.
336
70 to 80% is really very significant.
337
Can I ask you when you think about offering it to more people and then also the implementation of, you mentioned like the features that you have, implementing AI across the Duolingo product suite, it costs money.
338
At the end of the day, and a lot of companies are.
339
Do you see margin degradation by offering AI across the full product suite?
340
Because you're not charging more, but you are having an additional cost out to a model provider.
341
In terms of margins, as I explained before, there's these three use cases at Duolingo.
342
Number one is the content generation.
343
So content generation is just, it's good for margins, right?
344
So you.
345
Phenomenal for margins.
346
And it's also like, it's a one-off thing.
347
You generate the content, then it's done.
348
And then number two is these AI features like video called with Lily, where you actually have a unit cost.
349
You directly interact with an LLM on the back end, and you have to pay for that API call, right?
350
So there's an actual unit cost there.
351
And then, you know, you have to make that viable.
352
So we have three tiers: you know, the free tier, there's super, and there's max.
353
And it's mostly in our max, the higher tier subscription because of that reason.
354
So we would like to give this to everyone.
355
But the reality is today, there's a unit cost to AI, and therefore it's in our higher tier subscription.
356
We believe all of these costs will come down.
357
So the one, you know, the batch processing cost has already come down.
358
There's a lot of competition there.
359
And then in the kind of the real-time models, multi-model, there's also going to be, we hope there's going to be a lot of competition.
360
Costs will come down.
361
Eventually, I think we'll be able to give this to a lot more people or almost everyone.
362
When you think about like model relationships, you mentioned obviously being early access with OpenAI.
363
How do you think about the flexibility of moving between models with different generations of model, with different specialities of model?
364
Do you think you will have relationships with five model providers?
365
Or do you think it's like, oh no, we're tied to OpenAI?
366
I think there's going to be a lot of competition.
367
In more specialized use cases, the division model, multi-models.
368
There's less competition.
369
And you can see that there could be companies that keep a lead.
370
For I will voices, we also work with 11 labs, and they're just amazing models, amazing voices.
371
I can see that might be harder to replace with one or the other model.
372
When I hear you say about like 11 labs there, or Decagon there, or even think about Duolingo, the thing that I am struck with is, ah, that OpenAI are going to do that.
373
And I'd just love to go to the moment where I think Duolingo's stock actually took a hit.
374
And I never talk about like public market prices, so don't why we're not going there.
375
But I think it actually took a hit when there was the concern that OpenAI and ChatGPT would move into language learning very significantly.
376
Can you take me to the internal discussion around, oh shit, are ChatGPT and OpenAI going to move into the application layer for language learning?
377
The other thing that I think you see happening in the public markets, and this is my only comment about this, is like this bifurcation of the market into: is this an AI winner or is this an AI loser?
378
I think by mistake, we were first put into the AI loser category, and now it changed to like, oh no, Duolingo is going to be an AI winner.
379
And there's lots of tailwind from AI.
380
And I outlined some of this.
381
So there was never a concern for you internally.
382
You never had a call with Louise where you're like, oh shit, I'm going to do this.
383
And I assume here you mean like OpenAI or ChatGPT building a really good language tutor.
384
Yeah, like can they take away a lot of your very, very casual users by doing a very simplistic chat with a friend, choose your language?
385
That's definitely somewhat of a concern.
386
I think there's a bunch of things.
387
So, first of all, what is the hardest part about learning a language?
388
I would say the discipline.
389
Yes, it's the actual motivation.
390
And by the way, this is one of the key insights of Duolingo.
391
We've been sharing this with the entire world for the last 10 years, and still nobody seems to believe us.
392
So the hardest part is motivation.
393
And Duolingo is, because it's so gamified, it's really good at this.
394
It's a motivation engine.
395
I call it a motivation engine.
396
It really gets you to come back every day and do Duolingo.
397
And if you stick to it and you do the hard material, you will actually learn a language.
398
That is the power of Duolingo.
399
In general, people underestimate how important that is.
400
So if you want to build something that is as good as Duolingo, you have to solve this somehow.
401
If you ask our users, what do you do if Duolingo went away?
402
They never mentioned any of our language learning competitors.
403
They're like, oh, I would spend more time on social media.
404
And then the second thing is, if I was Sam Altman, I would go after the big trillion-dollar companies.
405
Why go into language learning when you can't go into search or social media?
406
Those are the things.
407
Well, if you're sitting there as Sam today, you're thinking there's kind of a couple of core areas which are winners.
408
There's chat, which we already own.
409
There's two, which is customer support, which I think they'll buy someone very soon.
410
There's coding, which they've obviously just bought someone.
411
And then I'd say language learning is the fourth.
412
As you said, it's so perfectly, I mean, LLM is kind of in the name.
413
It is so perfectly aligned to the use case of what they are best at.
414
It's not a stretch.
415
Yeah, we'll see.
416
We shall see.
417
One thing that I'd love though.
418
You know, the other thing is like, it's, Louis always says this, there's a difference between being a first-class citizen and a second-class citizen.
419
We have the streak, we have the XP, we have the leaks, and all that.
420
And you can build this all inside a different app.
421
But if it's just kind of a second-class citizen buried somewhere, again, it's like it's hard to make that experience as sticky as it if you build an app just for this purpose.
422
Is there anything within Duolingo that's a second-class citizen that you wish you could make a first-class citizen?
423
There's one thing, maybe.
424
So we have these stories inside Duolingo.
425
So every now and then you get a story.
426
I think they're actually becoming really good again with AI.
427
And there's kind of an entertainment aspect with this.
428
Like maybe you could actually make them more prominent, go into more like reading, including your first language, L1, or maybe something for kids, like learning how to read.
429
But we haven't done that yet.
430
It's not at the level of Harry Potter.
431
One thing that strikes me when I use Duolingo every day is exactly what you said there, which is the little things which make the product experience delightful.
432
And it reminds me of Gustav Sodestrom from Spotify, who always told me the details are not the details, they are the product.
433
And there's so many little things which make me feel that when I use Duolingo.
434
To what extent do you believe that and advise that to founders who call you versus Jesus, don't spend too long on the way that something pops up.
435
Just get it done in the early days.
436
I think ultimately product quality is details.
437
Luis, he's obsessed with details.
438
He can spot something being not properly aligned within half a second.
439
The details really, really matter.
440
If you look at retention, which is the main metric we care about, it's like the details really matter.
441
It really matters.
442
It also matters in terms of how likely you are to recommend it to a friend.
443
And you're not going to say, oh, you know, it's like, oh, it's super, like, you know, details are really good.
444
But it's like, it's a great app.
445
That's all details.
446
Difference between a good app and a great app is details.
447
Can I ask you, where did you spend time that with the benefit of hindsight?
448
You're like, ah, we shouldn't have spent time there.
449
So we started with languages.
450
But the mission was always all of education, right?
451
So at some point, it's like, okay, let's build new subjects.
452
We want to add new subjects.
453
And then someone said, let's add math.
454
Math is another one of these fundamental skills that we'll probably need to learn for the next 100 years or so.
455
And then the first idea was to build a new app.
456
In fact, we built a new app.
457
We built a new math app.
458
Completely standalone.
459
Completely standalone.
460
Wow.
461
So there was Duolingo, the main app, and there was an entirely new math app.
462
Did it have a name?
463
Yeah, it's the Duolingo Math App.
464
Creative.
465
Wonderful.
466
And then we realized, you know, this is looking more like the main Duolingo app.
467
And it's like, we were about to add a leaderboard and a league system and a streak.
468
And it was like, why are we doing this?
469
Like, why are we replicating this whole functionality?
470
That was insight number one.
471
And then insight number two is for the user, it was also not a great experience because first you had to know that Duolingo had a math app.
472
Then you had to find an app store, then you had to download it, then you had to install it.
473
Then you had to grant it permissions again to send your push notifications.
474
It was like, wait, is this streak different from my Duolingo streak?
475
It feels very much like Duolingo, but it's not quite Duolingo.
476
And then we said, no more new apps.
477
If it's education, it goes into the main app.
478
But it's kind of like a super app strategy.
479
So we didn't throw it out, but merged it with the main app.
480
Can you talk to me about chess?
481
How did the chess come about?
482
We mentioned it outside and it was a great story.
483
How did chess come about?
484
And talk to me about that.
485
Chess is an interesting one because, you know, is it really education?
486
You know, it helps you think.
487
I mean, we had this discussion before, should you still study computer science?
488
I think chess is similar in a way that it helps you think, helps you think logically.
489
And so we believe it fits within the mission of Duolingo, a similar one.
490
And then it was two people who were just super passionate about chess.
491
And it's like, hey, let's try to build a chess course.
492
And we were already.
493
Two people internally.
494
Internet, yeah, yeah.
495
And we were not convinced at first.
496
But this is.
497
Why are you not convinced?
498
We don't want to build just a game, right?
499
Like, there needs to be some educational aspect.
500
That's always a trade-off between, okay, are you just a game, or are you an educational game, or are you just a textbook boring experience?
501
So you have to find the balance between the two.
502
We don't want to eat just a game.
503
So with chess, it's different.
504
So chess is not a racing game or something.
505
Chess is like, you know, it helps you think.
506
So that's why we're good with it.
507
But then, how does this fit into the path?
508
How does this look inside Duolingo?
509
Can we make it fit into the Duolingo design language and all that?
510
So that's another concern.
511
But then, this is again super interesting.
512
And so the two of them, they built this prototype with AI.
513
The PM and designer, and the PM, he has some engineering background, so he knows how to think logically.
514
But he hadn't written much code before Duolingo or at Duolingo.
515
But he was able to build this first version just using Cursor and a bunch of AI tools.
516
And the prototype is what convinced us that we should do this.
517
If it had just been a fake, let's build this.
518
What was it about the prototype that was so good?
519
It was fun, it was progressive in terms of mindset.
520
You could play it and it just felt like this belongs inside the app.
521
You know, it's like when you just see a screen, it's like, oh, yeah, maybe you have to kind of imagine it.
522
Versus if you have the prototype, it's like, well, this looks and feels like Duolingo.
523
The other thing is because of AI, again, we were able to build this within nine months, fastest we ever created a new course.
524
So nine months from start to finish.
525
Yeah.
526
Wow.
527
And normally it would be years.
528
What do you not have that you would love to have in terms of activity?
529
You said that you've added languages, you've added maths, you've added music, and now we have chess.
530
What's the next one that you'd love to have?
531
What I'm most passionate about is the social aspect of the app.
532
You know, I think we have these leaderboard mechanics.
533
We now have this massive user base and we have all this brand love.
534
People love Duolingo.
535
And I feel like there's an untapped potential of connecting the people that are on Duolingo.
536
I don't know how to do it.
537
But I'm wondering.
538
What would that look like?
539
Sorry, duo-social?
540
Duo-date?
541
Because duo-date is not a terrible idea.
542
It's not.
543
Well, yeah, I don't know.
544
It could be something like that.
545
It could be, you know, learning together, but it could also be a lot of untapped potential that there's not that many apps that have.
546
Would you ever open a physical school?
547
And I know that sounds completely counter what Duolingo is all about, but having in New York a branded, amazing experience where people could go for a week, meet the owl, sit with people in their leaderboard, and build that community play that is really special and different.
548
That's a good question.
549
But one thing that is interesting about education is: okay, so there's K-12, and then there is higher ed, universities, colleges, et cetera.
550
One thing that's interesting when people talk about education, we always assume it's the instruction.
551
Here's skill, I learned the skill, and now I go from A to B.
552
That's kind of like how we think of education.
553
But higher ed, for example, is actually more than that.
554
Going to college, it's three things.
555
It is the actual instruction, it's actual teaching.
556
It's actually the learning of new skills.
557
Okay, that's number one.
558
But then there is also the degree, the credentials, right?
559
So the university says, Harry, you got a degree.
560
You successfully finished this course, and you can put this on your LinkedIn or resume, and then an employer can say, oh, I guess, you know, Harry did take this computer science class, and therefore we can hire them as an engineer.
561
So that's credentials, number two.
562
Very important.
563
Because otherwise, you would always have to prove again that you know something, right?
564
But that's the purpose of the degree.
565
And number three is the social aspect.
566
So a lot of people meet their partner at the university and their friendship network.
567
So most companies that look inside EdTech, they just focus on number one.
568
But I think if you really want to, let's say, if you really want to disrupt the Harvards of the world, you have to solve all three.
569
Do you want to disrupt Harvard?
570
No, so we want to achieve our mission.
571
That's why we started this company.
572
But by achieving your mission, are you not disrupting Harvard?
573
Yeah.
574
It would be.
575
But one thing, on the second thing, so we have not solved the social thing, right?
576
Okay, this is what higher ed does.
577
But on the number two, the credentials, one thing we're also very passionate about is the Duolingo score.
578
I'm not sure if you've noticed it.
579
And we want this to become the way people talk about language proficiency.
580
So it's like, hey, my Duolingo score is 61 in French.
581
And then people know, okay, I guess you can have this kind of conversation, et cetera, et cetera.
582
So we're getting into the credentials or the degree aspect of it with this score.
583
It's actually pretty helpful.
584
The amount of times you're all say, oh, you know, do you speak French?
585
And you're like, a little bit.
586
And it'd be helpful to say, oh, I'm actually a 40.
587
And they're like, okay, not really, you stupid.
588
Or whatever it is.
589
Do you know what I mean?
590
It quantifies it a lot more easily.
591
And this is kind of jumping around, but you mentioned the push notifications element.
592
Does that make a difference still?
593
We have so many push notifications.
594
With the oversupply push notifications, you're like, that was ruined.
595
It was good or not.
596
It still makes a huge difference.
597
And we know because whenever the service goes down that sends the push notifications, you can see the dip.
598
Really?
599
Yeah, yeah, yeah, 100%.
600
It's huge.
601
It's massive.
602
Wow.
603
Going back to the other, the other, like, so, so, those are the higher ed three things.
604
For K-12, you know, people also, okay, my kids, they go to school to learn things.
605
But again, it's not just the learning.
606
In fact, a lot of K-12 is childcare.
607
So even if you solve one aspect of it, like let's say you have an AI tutor that is really, really good, you still need to solve the childcare problem.
608
It's unlikely that people will just go to a school without any humans, without any teachers, and just use apps and then go home.
609
Or that we would have some sort of optimus in the school.
610
I think there's a lot of, it needs to be done by humans still.
611
And by the way, the other thing is like, I do believe that the AI tutors will become really, really, really good.
612
It's going to be the way most people learn most things in the future.
613
What does the future of schools look like then?
614
With that, is it like 10 children sitting in a class with AI tutors?
615
I think that there's still going to be this human element of what do I need to learn?
616
Kind of guidance and coaching and motivation.
617
And also, why should I learn this?
618
And AI will never tell you why you should learn this.
619
It's like, they'll help you learn it.
620
But it's not going to tell you, you know, why you should learn this.
621
Why is this important?
622
Do you know what I wish you had?
623
I'm sorry.
624
You have leaderboards, which is like social status or social mechanics that drive motivation and incentives.
625
I'm sure you've studied this.
626
I have because I'm a loser.
627
It's financial incentives.
628
And it's actually when you offer someone money, they are much less likely to do something.
629
When you take money away from them, they are much more likely to do it.
630
Basically, the fear of losing is much more than the gain of winning.
631
And I wish that you were lingo had this.
632
For every day you don't do your streak, we'll take a committed amount off you.
633
Say I commit to a hundred pounds a day, dude.
634
I would do that.
635
Like, a hundred percent.
636
A hundred percent.
637
You can you can just give me the money whenever that would be the best I'd give you another hundred.
638
How are you just giving me money?
639
Turn off his personal notifications, guys.
640
No more.
641
Yeah, yeah.
642
I mean, you know, you know, the streak is exactly this loss aversion mechanic, right?
643
So it's like it's motivating to build up your streak, but it's like, I absolutely do not want to lose my streak.
644
I will do a lot.
645
We had crazy stories of people who do crazy things too.
646
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
647
It's crazy.
648
And we also sometimes get emails like, you know, I was on this trip to climb Mount Everest and I couldn't extend my streak.
649
And can you please, you know, restore it or something?
650
And I had no internet access.
651
And do you go, no.
652
No, no.
653
By the way, also, when there's, you know, there was a power outage in Portugal and Spain, we proactively extended their streak.
654
So I do want to talk a little bit about how you work because you're fascinating in how you work.
655
I saw in some of your posts, you said you're not good at finishing the final 20% of a project or a bit of work.
656
That seems problematic, is it?
657
And how do you reflect on that?
658
It would be problematic if it was just me and everybody or everybody was like me.
659
You need to have complementary skills within the founders, but then also within the whole exec team, within the whole company, right?
660
So if everybody was really bad at finishing, by the way, the last 20% are basically details.
661
You need to have someone who's obsessed with details.
662
In Duolingo, that is Luis.
663
From day one, he was just obsessed with details and he really cares.
664
And I also care about details, but he is an order of magnitude better at that.
665
Has he ever been obsessed on details to the detriment of the company?
666
Dude, we don't need to obsess over it that much.
667
Come on.
668
That's a yes, but I'm not sure whether I should say it.
669
You know, he mostly works with the PM org, the product org, and they would probably say something like that when we still have this product review process where every change goes through review and Luis sits in most of those.
670
So he's he still does.
671
He still does.
672
So that's a founder mode for him.
673
It's like he's still in most of the product reviews.
674
And I think that's rare for a company CEO of our size, where the CEO still sits in most of the product reviews.
675
Wow.
676
So you decided to delegate that to the product team on whether he obsesses or not.
677
I love it.
678
How do you said founder mode that it drove so much engagement and discussion?
679
How do you reflect on it?
680
And when you look at your own style of management and leadership, how do you think about that?
681
My role has changed practically every year since the beginning, since when we started.
682
Yeah, Tanzine told me this.
683
I spoke to him from General Atlantic.
684
I stalked you, I told you.
685
And he said your role has changed so significantly.
686
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
687
So early on, I was implementing the thing.
688
I was building Duolingo.
689
And then it morphed more into code review architecture, how do we build the back-end system and all that, system design.
690
And then it morphed more into management hiring.
691
I think I'm actually quite good at hiring.
692
But then there's also other stuff that people wouldn't expect from a CTO.
693
Cool.
694
I was the one who pushed for hiring our first product manager.
695
It was actually interesting because Luis, at the time, he's like, oh, we don't need product managers.
696
He had seen some of them at Google and he had worked with some of them.
697
He's like, hey, you know, I don't think they provide that much value.
698
And we don't need this.
699
I can do this myself.
700
And we just need a bunch of designers.
701
Like, no, no, we really should.
702
You know, like if every single company has a product manager at our size, maybe, maybe we're wrong.
703
Let's hire one.
704
And if it doesn't work out, then we can still go with that.
705
But obviously, that was the right decision.
706
Obviously, that was the right decision.
707
Hiring.
708
What do you think makes you good at hiring that is non-obvious or not typical?
709
We have a really strong consumer brand.
710
So literally, everyone knows Duolingo at this point worldwide.
711
Given the strength of Duolingo's brand, do you think Duolingo is underpriced today?
712
I think you dramatically underprice brands.
713
And when you think about global brands, which billions of people know, underpriced is.
714
But it is just a merger.
715
Do you see what I mean by that?
716
People often think about Manchester United, global brand, for example.
717
And I think it's drastically underpriced, given the fact that you have children in India, Nepal, Brazil, wearing a man new shirt.
718
And it's a $5 billion company.
719
I think at some point we were bigger on TikTok than Nike, a brand that has existed for a very long time.
720
We all obviously know Nike.
721
And the other thing that is like, I always say, it's like, we run the world's most efficient marketing organization.
722
It's like people think, oh, yeah, you know, they're big because they spend a lot of money on advertising and social media influencers and stuff.
723
By impact, we must be the most efficient marketing org.
724
It's a small team.
725
How big is the team?
726
40 or so.
727
40 people or so.
728
The reason for it is for a very long time, we had no marketing budget.
729
We didn't advertise nothing, like zero-dollar marketing budget.
730
Because we were also not profitable, we also didn't have any revenue.
731
So it's like, no, we can't spend money that we don't have.
732
So there was like the constraint.
733
But then the constraint was really good at forcing us to come up with good ideas.
734
We always say the Duolingo marketing, it's not powered by money.
735
It's powered by ideas.
736
You know, what you see on our TikTok channel.
737
So it's, you know, having the green owl, our mascot, having the costume, and also, you know, kind of doing unhinged things.
738
And kind of like also making fun of ourselves in a way.
739
That is why it is so effective.
740
You mentioned about the not having PMs.
741
And actually, if all the biggest companies have them, maybe there's something to it.
742
And it makes me think of this, like, conventional rules are conventional for a reason sometimes.
743
What conventional rules are?
744
One.
745
And then what one conventional rule do you find that's just the way it's been, but it's not right.
746
You gotta feel sorry for my other half.
747
I ask questions like this on date night.
748
Well, first of all, I would say you should, not always, but every now and then, especially when there's a big technology shift like now, you should question all of these assumptions.
749
You know, how you build companies.
750
I think we're in the middle of this massive transformation.
751
You can build companies with probably 10 times fewer employees.
752
So that convention is completely overthrown at that, you know, that you need to hire a lot of people.
753
That's one thing.
754
I would say, you know, early on there was like there was like this belief that you can run a completely flat organization, right?
755
No, no managers, no hierarchies, no levels.
756
And that's not really possible.
757
At a certain scale, you need to have managers or layers or you need to have some sort of hierarchy, career progression and stuff like that.
758
I think that the oldest organization in the world, the Catholic Church that is still around, it's very hierarchical.
759
And I think there's probably some reason for it.
760
Does that not go against founder mode and Louis sitting in the product reviews?
761
And when you think about managers on managers and layers and the diffusion of kind of knowledge and power that comes with those layers.
762
Yeah, I think how do you strike the balance, right, between the two?
763
What do you still do today that you don't think you should do?
764
So like for me, I listen to every single show we do and I, yeah, yeah, yeah, 10 years in.
765
Why?
766
It's because it's my product.
767
I'm not shipping product that is not perfect.
768
You know, I'm actually quite good at delegating things and kind of like self-awareness of what I'm good at, what I'm bad at, what I like, what I don't like, what...
769
And one of my principles is reduce, automate, delegate.
770
Talk me through that.
771
Yeah, so the main idea is maybe like once a month, once a quarter, so really think about does this need to be done at all?
772
What happens if you don't do it?
773
If you just don't do it, is it the end of the world or is there an actual negative effect?
774
So that's number one.
775
And in particular, what happens if I don't do this?
776
And number two is what you cannot reduce, what you cannot remove.
777
Let's say you decide, okay, this actually needs to be done.
778
Then the second question is like, can I automate it?
779
Now, again, with AI, it's a lot easier.
780
Like, can I automate this part of my job?
781
Can I use ChatGPT to do this report or answer this question?
782
Or that's software engineering, that's very natural.
783
It's like, okay, can we build a tool that does this for me or the company or whatever?
784
And then what you can't automate, you delegate.
785
Okay, so that I try to delegate to other people in Dork.
786
You know, I've handed off most of the day-to-day engineering to our head of engineering.
787
She's really good with this.
788
I'm now a little bit out of the weeds.
789
I'm thinking more.
790
Right now, actually, I'm only focused on two things.
791
One is like with AI, like what's going to happen?
792
What does the future look like in our space?
793
What is the implications for Duolingo?
794
What actions do we need to take?
795
That's number one.
796
I probably spend 80% of my day thinking and acting on this, this AI question.
797
And number two is more MA.
798
And it relates to the first question: MA, like, you know, what companies should we buy?
799
Where do we invest externally?
800
That's basically all I do right now.
801
Where have you not invested that you would like to invest?
802
It could be an MA strategy where I say, oh, I wish we bought an avatar company.
803
I wish we bought an early 11 labs competitor.
804
I wish we'd integrated X.
805
We did make a bunch of acquisitions.
806
And they've done that 18, and there were a lot of lessons there.
807
Very interesting.
808
So one insight, and in hindsight, it's kind of obvious.
809
You know, they say, like, what is the best predictor of two founders working out?
810
Like, you know, they're actually, they're not going to get into a fight and founder conflict.
811
And the number one thing to look for is: have the two founders worked before they started this company?
812
Like, have they worked together?
813
For example, Louise and I, we have been working together on, you know, research for two years prior to starting Duolingo.
814
By the way, it's not the same as friendship.
815
You can know someone for a very long time, but they might be very different at work.
816
So prior work experience of working together.
817
That is number one.
818
With MA, it's the same thing, I actually think.
819
It's do you have prior experience working with this company?
820
Yes or no?
821
So I would say that's the number one advice: have you worked with them before?
822
Can also be an investment relationship.
823
Do you do Duolingo ventures?
824
Do you invest early?
825
We just made some minority investments, but it's not a lot.
826
It's always with a view to buy, essentially.
827
We have to figure this out.
828
It's a competitive space.
829
I've seen many competitors.
830
I remember, I think, came pretty close to being around in Practica.
831
How do you view the competitive landscape today and the distribution of value across it?
832
Is it like Uber and Lyft, where Uber takes 90% and everyone else takes 10%, and that's duo and everyone else?
833
Is it a much more distributed value kind of dispersion?
834
What does that look like?
835
In consumer, it's much more winner-take-all mechanics.
836
So we've been running this for two years.
837
Every single year, there was one or two companies that grow really fast in language learning, one or two.
838
Inevitably, they go down again.
839
What happened is they use venture money to grow through paid acquisition.
840
So, they spend it on Facebook ads, Google ads, and they go really fast.
841
But the only thing that matters is retention.
842
You can spend as much money as you want.
843
If you don't have retention, it's a leaky bucket.
844
All these people are going to leave.
845
Now, when you see one of those, we're not scared because we've seen this play out a million times.
846
So, the one company I'm scared of is one that has higher retention than Duoling.
847
What's the day retention number that matters to you?
848
Of the millions and millions of people that use Duoling today, how many come back tomorrow?
849
All of these correlate with each other.
850
So, if your current user retention is very high, you also have very high D7 retention, you also have very high D30 retention.
851
But you get a data point every single day.
852
Okay, that's absolutely fascinating.
853
It reminds me of Alex Schultz, who says exactly the same thing on retention, retention, retention.
854
I do want to ask, before we move into a quick fire, you're a European.
855
You are also based in New York.
856
When you look at Europe today, I sit here and I'm very aware of our fading into irrelevance, which is why we do things like Project Europe.
857
How do you think about Europe?
858
Are we fading into irrelevance?
859
And how do you see that having the perspective of being a European in the US?
860
I'm very conflicted internally.
861
I want Europe not to fade into irrelevance, of course.
862
However, if you ask me, a young founder, European founder, came to me.
863
He's like, hey, I have this brilliant idea of how to use AI or like a new model or something like that.
864
What should I do?
865
100%.
866
Go to Silicon Valley.
867
100%.
868
Absolutely maximum.
869
And I can say this because we built Duolingo in Pittsburgh.
870
We're not a Silicon Valley company.
871
We don't have an office in Silicon Valley.
872
We succeeded despite not being in Silicon Valley.
873
And by the way, there's also the pros of not being in Silicon Valley.
874
But I can guarantee you, Duolingo would not have been able to raise any money in Europe.
875
You know, we had zero-dollar revenue for the first five years.
876
Zero.
877
There's no European investor who would have invested.
878
Not in Switzerland, not anywhere in Europe.
879
Do you think that's true today?
880
I'm not being rude, dude.
881
You're a really smart guy.
882
You came out of great institutions.
883
Lewis, I know, is a super smart guy too, out of great institutions.
884
There's so much money in Europe now.
885
Dude, I'll give you a term sheet today when you were just the two of you coming in.
886
I think it has changed to a degree, but it's still, you need to look at what do these, the most ambitious people and the founders, where do they go?
887
It's a little bit sad because in Europe, I see a lot of European founders, and I often think, like, how successful would they be if they had stayed in Europe?
888
And I think for most of them, I would say, best maybe half as successful, or maybe some of them, 0%.
889
And I would like to change that.
890
I would like to change that.
891
I mean, that's why I invest in Project Europe.
892
We need to change that because.
893
How do you think then about Synthesia, about 11 labs, about some incredible lovable in Sweden being built from Europe?
894
They should deserve all of our support.
895
The sad part is also, I think, in Silicon Valley, is like being a tech founder is really, you know, you're mostly a good person.
896
Of course, there's also.
897
It's aspiring, right?
898
So people want to be that.
899
I think a lot of people in Europe, you're just like, why are you doing this?
900
Like, why, why?
901
Or they look at it as like, oh, yeah, you know, they're just doing it for the money or this suspicion, you can't be too successful, or you shouldn't be too ambitious.
902
And I think that that is very detrimental to the European startup ecosystem.
903
You shared an insight with me before that I'd never thought about having offices in San Francisco as a non-SF HQ'd company.
904
What was that insight and how did it lead to your not wanting to have an office in SF?
905
Yeah, so Dolongo does not have an office in Silicon Valley or anywhere in California.
906
The reason is when we thought about opening one and of course all of our investors, they said, you got to open an SF office.
907
And we in fact did go to SF and we looked at the office space.
908
We were this close to opening an office in SF.
909
But before we pulled the trigger, we asked a bunch of founders who had companies that were headquartered outside of Silicon Valley and then opened an office in Silicon Valley.
910
And we asked them, what do you think?
911
He goes, good decision, bad decision.
912
And all of them said, worst single decision ever.
913
And I said, why?
914
And they said, well, you know, what happens is it creates this internal funnel of your best employees moving from your HQ to Silicon Valley, which by itself is not a problem.
915
The problem is then they get recruited away by the, whatever the hot Silicon Valley company is at the time.
916
You know, like it could be Airbnb or Uber at the time.
917
Maybe now it's OpenAI or Anthropic.
918
And you basically create a hiring of Publiore for Silicon Valley and you lose your talent.
919
That was also new to me.
920
And then I was like, no, no, no, no, let's not do that.
921
I love that.
922
I hadn't thought about that at all.
923
And so you will not do an office in SF?
924
No.
925
Do you think I would be more?
926
And that's an unfair question to ask, but it's something that I've always been told, Severin, for years and years.
927
You have to, you have to.
928
Why are you in London?
929
As a founder, I would say 100%.
930
Let me tell you my rationale, and you can see if you think I'm right.
931
And you can call bullshit on me.
932
Like, in SF, I'm competing against Peter Fenton, Mark Andreessen, Vino Koesler, Eli Gill, the Collisons, Daniel and Matt Friedman.
933
I rate myself, I buy my product, but that is a fucking hard market.
934
And Mark Andreessen getting you around to his house for breakfast on a Saturday morning and in Europe?
935
It's probably two good VCs.
936
You know, by the way, so I started angel investing with a very similar thesis in Pittsburgh because there's no one other than me and Louise.
937
But then, you know, a lot of those companies eventually moved to Silicon Valley.
938
But yeah, that was exactly my investment thesis in Pittsburgh.
939
But I think as an investor, it's not clear.
940
And as an investor and doing the show, I think it's not clear because this is much less crowded.
941
You can really become the top investor that founders want to work with in Europe.
942
I agree.
943
But I was explaining this as a founder.
944
If you want to start a business, an AI business, you have this crazy idea.
945
Will you stay or not?
946
I would move.
947
But that's exactly the problem.
948
How can we change that?
949
You know, part of the problem, this is a little non-obvious, is part of the problem is it's so easy to move to Silicon Valley.
950
A good degree and you can raise money, et cetera.
951
The US is actually really good at getting these brains to come to Silicon Valley.
952
In a way, the best thing that could happen to Europe is if the US made it really hard to immigrate for founders.
953
If they made it really hard, if they restricted immigration such that people like me couldn't move there anymore, then.
954
Right now, there's also no pressure from the industry to change the regulation to make it easier to start companies because I can just go.
955
I can vote with my feet.
956
What would you change about Europe?
957
Is it the regulation?
958
Is it the level of capital?
959
Is it the mindset that we tell young people?
960
Regulation is definitely hurting.
961
No great entrepreneur was stopped by regulation, though.
962
Which is like Travis wasn't stopped by regulation with Uber.
963
Elon with SpaceX wasn't stopped by regulation.
964
Regulation does not inhibit the greatest entrepreneurs.
965
Again, I think it depends if there's an alternative or not.
966
Again, as a founder, I can like, okay, I can work with the EU regulation on AI, which is some of the dumbest regulation ever.
967
You know, the Ottoman Empire, they had, when they invented the printing press, it's like, oh, this is not good.
968
It's not good for our community.
969
Let's not do the printing press.
970
I feel like the EU AI Act is that.
971
Let's not do AI, because there could be negative repercussions or negative side effects or something.
972
It's that dumb.
973
If there was no alternative, then I would agree.
974
By the way, for example, in Uber's case and Airbnb, there's a lot of local regulations.
975
There's actually lots of alternatives.
976
So even if, say, one city doesn't work, it's like New York, this is the regulation.
977
You have 200 other cities in the US.
978
If you could go back to the early days of Duolingo and do something differently, what would you do most significantly?
979
We're pretty open up this.
980
I think that the two mistakes we've made at Duolingo, they were not fatal, but obviously, $20 billion.
981
I would say the two big, big ones were: one, we waited too long.
982
Like our business model, people ask, what's your business model?
983
Oh, it's a venture capital.
984
And eventually we did take it seriously.
985
And we're very good at this now.
986
We have this internal concept of the green machine.
987
It's like run a lot of experiments, see what works, and then double down.
988
And that's what we did with monetization.
989
It's super good now.
990
But we just waited for too long.
991
Was that because of naivety?
992
Was that because of a push for user growth and engagement?
993
Yeah, combination.
994
So it was also like the investors didn't push us to monetize early, which is, it was always counterintuitive to me.
995
It's like, why don't they ask for monetization?
996
But I never would, because I'd want engagement and I'd want user behavior and I want habit forming.
997
Don't fucking put a paywall in front of them.
998
Yeah, and then, you know, our investors, they also invested in Twitter and some of these.
999
And for those platforms, it was always the right decision to just grow users first.
1000
Grow users first.
1001
So that's what we did.
1002
So number one is we knew we could always grow users first.
1003
Number two is we knew we could always raise more money.
1004
And I think the other one was our mission, right?
1005
So our mission is to provide the best education and make it universally available.
1006
For a long time, we didn't know how to build a business model that is compatible with this mission, right?
1007
So for a long time, it's like everything has to be free.
1008
But then we realized, no, no, no, no.
1009
What really matters is that we don't exclude people.
1010
You should be able to learn everything that is on Duolingo without a bank account.
1011
And it's still true today.
1012
You know, most of our users do not pay Duolingo.
1013
They use the free tier.
1014
That's actually another thing I'm very proud of.
1015
It's like, it's not just a great business, but it's a great business with a great purpose.
1016
That's also why we probably waited for a little bit too long.
1017
You know, we should have started two years earlier.
1018
Number two is we also waited.
1019
It was pretty chaotic.
1020
That goes against everything everyone says to me on the show.
1021
Everyone always eschews, don't hire the senior manager.
1022
If they've been there, done it before, the playbook's not transferable.
1023
You want youngsters that you bring up through the ranks.
1024
They want to be involved more in the weeds and the hands-on.
1025
Beware of the manager.
1026
You cannot run a thousand-person company with all new grads.
1027
You need a little bit of both.
1028
By the way, today, it's still doing as a very young organization.
1029
We still hire a lot of people directly from university.
1030
You mentioned you always knew that you could raise more money.
1031
I love that.
1032
What's the business model?
1033
Venture capital.
1034
Harry's like, thank God I still have a job.
1035
But when you think about the fundraisings that you did, what was the hardest?
1036
A Series A.
1037
Talk to me about that.
1038
We started as a research project at Carnegie Mellon University.
1039
The belief was, oh, it's these two academics.
1040
Luis was a professor and I was his PhD student.
1041
It's these two academics and they're going to build something that's not going to make any money and they're going to sell to Google.
1042
Okay.
1043
And then that was kind of the belief.
1044
And by the way, that belief lasted until we actually made money.
1045
So for like five years, the first five years, oh, yeah, they're, they're, you know, these like these, these two researchers, and they're going to build this thing, and they're eventually going to sell.
1046
And they're not going to become a public company or anything.
1047
That was one reason.
1048
And then this was 2011.
1049
We raced on a prototype and it was a website.
1050
For a Series A.
1051
Yeah, yeah.
1052
My co-founder, he had two prior exits, so he had a track record.
1053
That was actually the other belief was like, okay, these two researchers are going to sell to Google.
1054
So they were basically buying a ticket for the next company companies, including the first one.
1055
They didn't believe that this was going to become this big.
1056
How much was the Series A?
1057
$3 million at 15.
1058
Yeah.
1059
That was a Series A.
1060
Yeah, yeah, this.
1061
It's called Pre-Pre-Seed today.
1062
That's like your friends and family.
1063
Yeah.
1064
You do a PayPal round.
1065
We never raised Seed or Pre-Seed.
1066
This was because we had these NSF grants, so we built this project inside the university.
1067
So Series A was our first round.
1068
Who did that round?
1069
And can you take me to the moment when you signed the term sheet?
1070
Union Square Ventures, it was hard.
1071
I think we may have to cut this afterwards, but I think we only had one offer.
1072
It was Unisquare or Back to University.
1073
But isn't that amazing, though, that Union Square, one of the best firms in the world, recognized and statistically proven with data, and the one offer?
1074
This is what I see so often, though, that I don't think there's anything controversial about that.
1075
That just shows quality in picking.
1076
Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.
1077
I mean, and they were amazing investors.
1078
What do you think they saw that others didn't?
1079
Okay, so one thing that was true back then is we did the Silicon Valley Roadshow.
1080
We actually did get a lot of interest from Silicon Valley PCs at a time.
1081
But they all made it a requirement to move to Silicon Valley.
1082
That was always the question.
1083
We're super interested, we want to make a deal here.
1084
When are we moving to SF or Bay Area?
1085
And we're like, we're not moving.
1086
And then they immediately lost interest.
1087
By the way, some of them later invested in later rounds.
1088
But they didn't want to be the first one in a non-Silicon Valley company.
1089
Do you think the best founders need investor value?
1090
No, I would say the best founders do not need investor value.
1091
However, I would say investors need to have your back.
1092
Absolutely.
1093
That is important.
1094
You should always try to hire, raise money from the best tier one VCs, even if the terms are slightly worse.
1095
I mean, there's again, why do you say that?
1096
Because so much signaling.
1097
Series A was the hardest, but because Unisquare invested, it's like every other investor, like, okay, what does Unisquare do?
1098
Because they had this amazing track record and amazing performance.
1099
And if Unisquare invests in your company, they will look at it.
1100
Really, really, really powerful.
1101
Every other round, it was a lot easier.
1102
That's the weird thing.
1103
It's harder to raise 3 million than it is to raise 100 million.
1104
I totally see that.
1105
What was the easiest round to raise?
1106
The latest ones, yeah.
1107
It was just everybody wanted to invest.
1108
Was there a question with you and Louise where you were like, do we think 5 billion, and this is obviously at the time, do we think that's not a bit high?
1109
How do you reflect on price and overpricing when you have such demand?
1110
We were thinking, like, we don't want to have a down round, no down rounds.
1111
Okay, by the way, we also never had a layoff.
1112
You know, growing fast, but we never went on a hiring spree or and we never wanted to have a down round.
1113
And the problem also with raising a lot of capital at a super high valuation is like the expectations become very, very because obviously you're not worth that much at a time, but they all want you to grow into that valuation, right?
1114
So that's why they invest.
1115
Oh, yeah, you know, to today, you know, if you if you take your ARR multiple or whatever, which by the way was infinite the joys of raising.
1116
So.
1117
So that's one thing we wanted to avoid.
1118
We wanted to avoid a down round, and we wanted to avoid having an investor that just has extreme expectations that we cannot live up to.
1119
That was kind of our philosophy.
1120
The other thing I learned on the fundraising is, you know, I thought every deal is custom.
1121
Every deal is custom.
1122
Like, you know, your series A is different from my Series A, and your Series B is completely different from my Series B.
1123
And what I realized, there's only three possible deals.
1124
One is no deal.
1125
Nobody wants to.
1126
Number one is, and that's the default, right?
1127
It's like nobody wants to invest.
1128
Number two is you get a standard deal.
1129
And the standard deal is what most companies get at your stage, the standard Series A deal.
1130
I don't know what it is today.
1131
About 15 to 20% dilution, whatever the price and embedded is.
1132
That was basically our deal at the time, right?
1133
So you got a standard deal.
1134
And then there's like the extreme outlier deal.
1135
That's like one or two companies of our generation get that one.
1136
Facebook got that one or Uber, Airbnb.
1137
They probably got some of those.
1138
You see it more and more today, which is actually, I think, brilliant rounds for companies where they raise, say, $100 million on a $2 billion price.
1139
And you're like, wow, $100 million is a lot of money to bring into a company financing-wise, but only diluting 5% is a small amount for quite a large and significant amount to bring in.
1140
I think they're good rounds to do for companies.
1141
Yeah.
1142
And so those are the three types.
1143
Those are the three types.
1144
Did you do the third type?
1145
We never did the third type.
1146
We always got pretty much a standard deal.
1147
I think the last couple were more competitive.
1148
And, you know, by the way, we could have raised a lot more at higher valuations, but we didn't do it.
1149
Who was the most helpful investor?
1150
Unisquare was great.
1151
Bing is actually a great.
1152
He uses the product and he gives us a lot of feedback on the product.
1153
He's obsessed with the product.
1154
Most investors are, they're more like business types, and like, okay, investment and return and EBITDA and all that.
1155
And Bing is a very different type of investor.
1156
And going into a territory, you might go, Harry, wave the white flag.
1157
Do you like being public?
1158
I have a new theory that why would anyone go public today when, if you have a consumer brand, you never need to.
1159
And what I mean by that is: if you're the Collisons, if you're Ali at Databricks, if you're Elon at SpaceX, you don't need to go public today.
1160
The extension of private markets is so significant that there's just no need.
1161
If Duo were private today, would you go public?
1162
Yes.
1163
So I'm in the camp of, yes, you should go public.
1164
It's actually the better thing for the ecosystem.
1165
In fact, I believe there should be more European companies going public because it doesn't matter.
1166
It doesn't matter.
1167
As long as it kind of flows back to the European ecosystem.
1168
But for Duolingo, it has been a great journey, actually.
1169
Going public, bringing the NASDAQ, the bell, career highlight.
1170
By far.
1171
It's incredible.
1172
I felt like I grew up in this small town in Switzerland, made it to the US, got a PhD, started this company.
1173
It's my first job.
1174
I've never worked anywhere else.
1175
And then this became this huge hit, massive audience, millions and millions of people loving the product, great purpose.
1176
Unicorn, DecaCorn, public company.
1177
You feel like it gives you this achievement.
1178
It feels like you won a big tournament.
1179
You're not done, right?
1180
It's not done.
1181
And it's not.
1182
It's a milestone.
1183
Most founders that are not CEOs, they leave after four or five years, you know, once they're fully vested, or at least when they, you know, when they get acquired or IPO.
1184
I'm still with the company.
1185
The one thing I think is, yes, these private markets are now much, much, much bigger.
1186
And there's lots of pros of staying private, right?
1187
For us, before we went public, our finance team, for example, was two people.
1188
Now it's, I think, 25 or so.
1189
So there's a lot of overhead.
1190
And the financial markets, they really care about predictability.
1191
So in fact, I feel like they care even more about that than they care about the actual profit margins or growth or whatever.
1192
They really care that you can't predict.
1193
And I think that the way they see this is like if you can't predict the future of your business, you're not a good operator.
1194
You probably don't understand what drives your business or they kind of like lose trust in the management team.
1195
So something like that.
1196
Do you not think that's the biggest weakness now more than ever before?
1197
Because this is a time where there's no predictability, where models can change, where DeepSee can come out and completely change how we think about planning China's approach to AI or open source or whatever that is.
1198
And actually, respectfully, I don't think we can predict very well.
1199
To you now, doing MAs, investing, thinking about the future of AI, God, that's negative to place a premium on predictability.
1200
Yeah, there's so much uncertainty in the market right now.
1201
I think right now, if you're a private company, there's a stronger argument for staying private.
1202
But for the very, you know, the much more mature businesses like Stripe, I think you want to go public because you create this liquidity for your employees.
1203
And yes, there's like other ways to do it, and you can do secondaries and all that.
1204
One thing I am also proud of is that we hire.
1205
Now it flows back into the Pittsburgh ecosystem and maybe some of it the New York ecosystem.
1206
But if we had more European companies, Spotify, go public and then making lots of employees make some money and then maybe start own companies, that is like what we need.
1207
That's what we need in Europe.
1208
I agree.
1209
I just don't know if that mechanism is IPOs.
1210
I think you need a consumer brand to have that extension in private markets.
1211
If you're a boring B2B company that does, I don't know, whatever, no one cares about, you kind of have to go public because there's not the appetite, I don't think, on the later stage demand in the private markets.
1212
But like Duo could stay private today longer.
1213
And there's so many different ways of getting share buybacks.
1214
There's so many people who want to have that late stage secondary access.
1215
I think you can do it.
1216
I think that's a big question for the next years.
1217
And then the other big question is like Deliveroo.
1218
Delivery sold for 2.9 billion.
1219
It was priced at 1.5 billion on the UK Stock Exchange.
1220
It's a $1.4 billion delta in how they value a company.
1221
Mega.
1222
Listen, dude, I want to do a quick fire.
1223
I could talk to you all day.
1224
What's the biggest near-death experience with Duo?
1225
Is that like a day where you're like, oh my God, that was the hardest day?
1226
It's not a single day, but it's the first five years we had.
1227
When you said five, I was like, five days, five years?
1228
Yeah, yeah.
1229
We just didn't know how to find a business model that aligns with our mission.
1230
It was hard.
1231
What's the best angel investment you've made and why, do you think?
1232
I'm not a good angel investor.
1233
Why?
1234
There's an overlap between being a good founder and a good investor.
1235
Ultimately, they're different things.
1236
First of all, the investment cycle is 10 years, right?
1237
So, versus as a founder, at least RSDH, you get data points every day.
1238
You can learn.
1239
The feedback loops are so much faster.
1240
I think I'm better with the.
1241
I've had a few successes, like a 10x or something, but you've had a few 10xes.
1242
Yeah.
1243
Yeah, that's pretty rare, you know.
1244
But I know these people are not considered myself.
1245
In an investor's life, they don't have that many 10xes.
1246
We chat a big game.
1247
What do you hear a lot from investors that you're like, really?
1248
So, one thing they ask this question, like, what is the secret sauce?
1249
Why is Dooling so successful?
1250
And they look for an answer that is like a one-word explanation.
1251
And you can tell when you give them the actual answer, they're disappointed.
1252
They wish the answer was, it's a streak.
1253
That's the secret sauce.
1254
You know, it's this one mechanic.
1255
That's why we're so successful.
1256
And we invented it or whatever.
1257
We maximized it or whatever.
1258
Or it's the leaderboards.
1259
Or it's like, oh, we're so good at this particular market.
1260
It's like Brazil.
1261
That's a secret sauce.
1262
We figured out how to crack Brazil.
1263
And, you know, like, whatever.
1264
They want an answer like that.
1265
Then Louis keeps telling them the true answer, which is it's running thousands and thousands of A-B experiments.
1266
The streak mechanic, for example, you know, we added it.
1267
That was one experiment.
1268
But then we've probably run 300 experiments, fine-tuning the streak mechanic.
1269
And that's where you get the gains in retention.
1270
And that's what ultimately drives the growth of Duolingo, which is still super fast.
1271
We're still growing so fast.
1272
The green machine is like, what I mentioned before is like we run a lot of experiments.
1273
This is also true for marketing.
1274
It's not A-B experiments, but it's more like, let's try this on TikTok, let's try this on Instagram, and then double down on the stuff that works.
1275
And that's it.
1276
That's the secret sauce.
1277
And what I mean by that is content's a really good example.
1278
It takes time to know if content works.
1279
And so you have to do things with no obvious gain in the short term for compounding long-term advantage.
1280
Does that make sense?
1281
It's almost a bit like the gym.
1282
You don't gain muscle day one, day two, week one, you'd be like, Harry, quit this.
1283
This A-B test is failing.
1284
But three months in, it shows.
1285
I would agree with that.
1286
I think there's like the trap you can run into is you only run tiny experiments, right?
1287
Like on your purchase page, or you run these tiny experiments on copy or something.
1288
And I think it's very important that you have your portfolio of changes.
1289
So you have lots of low-risk, small changes, but you also have some big changes.
1290
And a big change could be adding chess or adding math.
1291
And that's how you stay innovative and relevant.
1292
Otherwise, you end up in a local maxima where you can't get out because you've optimized yourself into that.
1293
What have you changed your mind on most in the last 12 months?
1294
AI and the impact of it.
1295
I've gone back and forth on basically any of the fundamental questions.
1296
Like, is it going to change the world?
1297
I'm going to have more engineers, fewer engineers.
1298
One thing I think that gets lost in the conversation is that, okay, let's assume AI really drives productivity gains.
1299
We all become more productive.
1300
You become more productive.
1301
I become more productive.
1302
Everybody we work with becomes more productive, let's say 20, 30%.
1303
Is that good or bad?
1304
Good.
1305
That's great.
1306
You know, one of the big problems we have is demographics.
1307
We all need to become more productive.
1308
We don't have enough kids.
1309
And then, you know, like, how are we going to finance our?
1310
We need every single productivity gain we can get.
1311
In the U.S., there's this huge deficit.
1312
It's all the debt.
1313
But if you can grow the economy 10% year on year instead of 1%, or I guess right now we're in the recession.
1314
But if you can grow it 10% or more, all these problems will go away.
1315
It will really be an age of abundance.
1316
Will we have AI friends in the future more than normal friends?
1317
No, that I don't believe.
1318
No, I think the human-to-human interaction, the value of that will go up significantly.
1319
Why?
1320
There's going to be value on verified human, even if it's not as good.
1321
So, for example, in the art world, I believe that art that was made before 2022 is going to increase in value because it's verified human.
1322
Picasso, we know, it was Picasso.
1323
But it wasn't Sam Altman masquerading in his exact thing.
1324
Exactly.
1325
Who's the most underrated founder in AI right now?
1326
We talked about a deck ago, and I think that it's an amazing company.
1327
Whose life do you secretly admire and why?
1328
There's this Naval Ravikant quote.
1329
It's a fancy case.
1330
The true measure of intelligence is if you get out of life, what do you want to get out of life?
1331
By that definition, I'm maybe 80% successful or intelligent.
1332
What do you not have?
1333
But I have an investor friend.
1334
I'm not going to share who it is.
1335
But I feel that guy has kind of figured it out for himself.
1336
What do you not have?
1337
You said 80%.
1338
What's the 20%?
1339
You know, one thing I would say is one of the reasons why I said yes to this podcast or why I wanted to be on this podcast is I feel like I'm reduced to just Duolingo.
1340
My identity is Duolingo.
1341
I'm the founder of Duolingo.
1342
Every international.
1343
And I feel there's much more to me, to my personal identity, than just Duolingo.
1344
That's the other 20% that I have not, you know, really explored or haven't been able to, you know, share.
1345
I think the hardest thing is like identity is tied to company.
1346
And when your identity is tied to your company, the performance of your company denotes the happiness of yourself.
1347
I have this.
1348
I've only ever had one job, which is 20 BC.
1349
When we're not doing well, either fund or media company, I'm depressed.
1350
That's hard.
1351
So true.
1352
And I have talked to many founders who left their company, and there's like, I would say, half of them fall into a depression because their identity is the company.
1353
And you know, another thing, I don't know if you noticed this, but could you ever leave?
1354
Don't laugh, but when it is so tied to you, like yours is to you and mine is to me, 11 years, yours is even longer.
1355
The thing is, I just still enjoy it so much.
1356
And sometimes I wish I hated my job.
1357
And then it would make it easy to leave and do something else.
1358
But I still really enjoy it.
1359
Another point was when early on, and it's still somewhat true, when the employee leaves, quits, it's like a punch in the gut.
1360
Depends which employee.
1361
Sure, sure, sure, sure.
1362
Sure.
1363
But it's like, why did I leave?
1364
What did I do wrong?
1365
Do they not believe in this company anymore?
1366
I think about this for weeks.
1367
Neil Matter asks a brilliant question from Green Oaks.
1368
He likes to go into a company and ask the employees, Are your best days ahead or behind you?
1369
When I ask you that for duo, why would you say they're ahead of you?
1370
Well, thanks for assuming that they're ahead of us.
1371
As I said, going back to the very beginning of the conversation, it's like the mission is this, to provide the best education, making universally successful.
1372
But now I think we can really do it.
1373
You know, we can really build an AI tutor that is as good as the best human AI tutors.
1374
And we can do it for everyone, not just the rich.
1375
And that will change the world.
1376
I really think this is the moment.
1377
You know, we have to wait for 10 years to get to this stage.
1378
But I think this AI wave is going to really enable us to do this.
1379
Final one on public market caps and stuff.
1380
I believe you're probably, I don't know, ownership structures, whichever we should do.
1381
I believe you'd probably be a billionaire, technically.
1382
So well done.
1383
My question to you is: do you think about money?
1384
And how does money and happiness correlate or not correlate for you?
1385
Yeah, and I've also spent a lot of time thinking about this question.
1386
The weird thing is I wish I hadn't.
1387
You know, like, I feel like it's not a productive thing.
1388
You know, am I happier now than I was when I was a grad student?
1389
And is it because of the money?
1390
Or is it because of the success?
1391
Or is it because I know myself better?
1392
And it's very hard to disentangle all the different factors that go into happiness.
1393
I would say, though, that there's different levels of wealth.
1394
And they actually did this study, I think, with post-exit founders.
1395
They asked them, How much is enough?
1396
How much is enough?
1397
When do people switch their opinions?
1398
Okay, now this is enough.
1399
The answer they got was, you know what the answer was?
1400
$20 million.
1401
No, $100 million.
1402
$100 million?
1403
$100 million.
1404
Jesus, inflation is real.
1405
Whoa.
1406
So that's a lot of.
1407
That was the answer of those people.
1408
It's kind of like when you stop, I guess, worrying about it, because it's so much.
1409
I mean, it's so much.
1410
Did you have a number when you started?
1411
No, I want.
1412
This is a mission-earned company.
1413
And I tweeted this recently.
1414
It's like, I think that the counterintuitively, the founders that start with a purpose and a mission and are not focused too much on money end up usually doing better.
1415
Maybe people don't give them credit, but I do because I'm in the same situation.
1416
I think Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg, you know, Bill Gates wanted to put a computer on every desk.
1417
And then he realized, okay, well, how do I do this?
1418
And one way of doing it, or maybe the only way of doing it, is starting a company.
1419
They're not like, I'm going to start a company to become rich.
1420
That's like kind of the reverse thing.
1421
It's like you have to think, okay, what change do you want to see in the world?
1422
What do people want?
1423
How can I help other people?
1424
That's ultimately, in an ideal capitalist environment, that should drive value.
1425
And I do believe that that's why these companies got started.
1426
And Mark Zuckerberg, maybe connecting people.
1427
What do you think was the biggest needle mover for your happiness?
1428
And because for me, there's like pay rent, easy.
1429
I can live life like I kind of want to, but I'm not loaded.
1430
I still kind of need to work, but I'm not loaded.
1431
Probably a couple of million.
1432
There's the 10 to 20, which is like, I'm pretty good.
1433
Adding another 80 is not going to change much, actually.
1434
I still have a super nice house and I'm good.
1435
And then there's the 100, I can take jets when I want to.
1436
I do believe I'm happier now than not by a lot.
1437
I was pretty happy in my 20s too, but a little bit.
1438
I think this sense of achievement, and it will never go away.
1439
Even if, you know, even if Duolingo collapses tomorrow, it's still a good thing.
1440
It's like, you know, I tried, you know, and it worked out for a while and then maybe it goes away.
1441
But I would still have this sense of achievement.
1442
And in other things, when people just share their Duolingo stories, or when I, you know, I was in Venice a year ago or two years ago, and they have the bus is a boat, right?
1443
So I took the bus on the canal, and next to me was this woman, like literally like sitting next to me, this woman doing Duolingo.
1444
And I was just looking at it and I was like, you know, if she knew, you know, I was sitting next to you.
1445
Did you say nothing?
1446
Nothing.
1447
I was just for a 10-minute ride, she was doing her Duolingo, and I saw how she used it.
1448
And I was just like, this is amazing.
1449
Does money change marriage?
1450
Wow.
1451
I thought it was going to be the quick run.
1452
It is.
1453
I think the answer depends on your answer of the question: does money change people?
1454
Because if it changes people, it'll probably change marriage.
1455
So I assume the answer is yes, but it depends on the people.
1456
Did it change in your case?
1457
A little bit.
1458
So we met before I was successful.
1459
In fact, my now-wife, time girlfriend, she, for the first couple of years, she made more than me.
1460
So we kind of reversed that.
1461
She knows me from when I wasn't very successful, when I was just a dude with some crazy ideas.
1462
I think it's different than if I had to date someone now.
1463
Because again, everybody, everything starts with this.
1464
Oh, co-founder of Duolingo.
1465
And then super successful, everybody, well, everybody knows like a my CEO, like my co-founder is obviously way more famous.
1466
But it's hard to remove that.
1467
So in fact, I wish you could go into like you could switch, you know, like um you could go into incognito mode, like in in the browser.
1468
It's like, you know what, I'm just gonna put on uh glasses and it's like I don't wanna be in fact, you know, people sometimes ask, oh well, yeah, I always ask you, like, what do you do?
1469
And when I'm in a, in a, in a room where I know they don't know who I am.
1470
Or I say, like, I'm a software engineer at the top tech company.
1471
Or I say I'm a patron of the arts, which is not entirely untrue.
1472
Because I know how the conversations go when I tell the truth.
1473
There's a next question is, how many languages do you speak?
1474
Next question is, how did you start Tuolinga?
1475
Why has it been so successful?
1476
And the next question is, if they're a user, it's like, oh, I love your, you know, my streak is this long.
1477
And that's actually what if they're actual users, it's much more interesting to me.
1478
A final, final one, I promise, but an important one.
1479
Everyone has said, including Warren Buffett, the most important thing in life is partner selection, who you choose to spend your life with.
1480
I spoke to everyone on your tap table, and they all said about the special relationship you and Luis have.
1481
I'm intrigued.
1482
We mentioned marriage there.
1483
Whether it's Luis or marriage, I don't mind really.
1484
What would be your biggest advice on partner selection?
1485
So for founders, I think it's a little easier.
1486
One thing is like, have you worked previously with this person?
1487
The keys worked, not hung out at the bar.
1488
It's like, have you worked with this person prior to starting this company?
1489
And Luis and I, we had worked together for two years prior.
1490
So we kind of already knew how we work and what we're good at, what we're bad at, priorities.
1491
And we actually had this very early on, we had this, because I went from, you know, he was my superior, he was my PhD advisor, and I was his student, into an equal relationship, but we're equal co-founders.
1492
And I was like, can I trust this guy?
1493
What if he just fires me after a year?
1494
So, you know, we're going to make decisions.
1495
It's like this short.
1496
This is how we're going to make decisions.
1497
This is Louis's responsibility.
1498
This is Severin's responsibility.
1499
And we both signed it.
1500
And I think that avoided a lot of conflict.
1501
And the other thing that's interesting, I think a lot of the conflicts happened in the first two years.
1502
What was the biggest conflict?
1503
Probably what to build the product itself.
1504
There were conflicts there, and then also on hiring, not hiring, firing, et cetera.
1505
There were a bunch of conflicts as well.
1506
And then I think we had it all worked out.
1507
And it's amazing.
1508
I only meet with Louis every other week.
1509
And sometimes the meeting lasts 10 minutes.
1510
We go into a meeting, like the exec team meeting.
1511
And I have a pretty good language model of what he's going to say or how he's going to react to a certain idea.
1512
Because we had been working together for the first six, seven, eight years in the same room every day for 50, 60 hours a week.
1513
I know him better than probably any other person other than my wife and vice versa.
1514
Your wife, biggest advice on partner selection romantically?
1515
I would say, do you enjoy talking to this person?
1516
You enjoy talking to many people.
1517
Yeah, but I think it's like...
1518
I call it the Tuesday night test, which is like in five years' time, will you be excited for just you and them to sit down and just talk?
1519
And there's very few people where five years' time, Tuesday night, it's a cold February evening in Pittsburgh or London or wherever you are, if it's like hell yeah.
1520
Yep, I think that's one thing.
1521
And I think then also like mutual support.
1522
You know, do they support you in what you do?
1523
Or is there a competition?
1524
I think competition, you don't want to have competition.
1525
I'm so pleased we got a chance to do it.
1526
Thank you for being so open.
1527
You have been amazing.
1528
All right.
1529
I mean, it shows like that where I remember why I love what I do so much.
1530
