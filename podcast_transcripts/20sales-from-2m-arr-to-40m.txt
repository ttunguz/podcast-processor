1
You are listening to 20 Sales with me, Harry Stebbings.
2
Now, 20 Sales is the monthly show where we sit down with the best sales leaders to discuss how they start, scale, and maintain incredible sales teams today.
3
Now, I'm so excited to welcome an incredible guest in the form of Kyle Norton.
4
Kyle is the chief revenue officer at owner.com, where he scaled revenue from 2 million to 40 million in ARR in under three years, while selling to one of the hardest markets, SMB restaurants.
5
Before Ona, Carl led sales at Shopify, where he helped architect one of the most operationally elite GTM orcs in SaaS.
6
And Carl is really known for turning sales orcs into machines.
7
At ONA, he's systematized this incredible revenue engine that we really unpack today in this show.
8
Get the notebooks out.

Carl, it is such a joy, man.
39
I literally was chatting to Jack Altman last night.
40
I was chatting to Jason this morning.
41
They said wonderful things.
42
I'm not sure how much you paid them, but so appreciate you joining me, Stayman.
43
Yeah, I'm stoked to be here, being a listener since the very, very beginning.
44
So this is a ton of fun.
45
Dude, so bad we could do it in person.
46
I would love to start, though.
47
I think we're shaped a lot by our experience.
48
How did your time at Shopify impact how you think about effective selling today with owner?
49
So, I actually think the lessons that I most deeply took from Shopify are on the product side.
50
And you can't be taken seriously at Shopify without being well-versed in the language of product.
51
I oftentimes joke that the hierarchy is engineering is the top of the totem pole, and then it's design and product management.
52
There's janitorial services here, and then sales is like just below that.
53
So, if you want to be somebody whose opinions are listened to, like you have to know product and have to speak in that language.
54
And so, as soon as I got there, I started to get to work.
55
I did like a reforge course.
56
Did you become a better sales leader through product knowledge?
57
A thousand percent.
58
Wow.
59
So much of building a great go-to-market organization is systems engineering.
60
I'm sure we're going to talk about this a ton today.
61
And product management and building product is that.
62
It's systems engineering.
63
It's being able to get to first principles and root cause and then reason up from there.
64
That skill set has translated tremendously.
65
Like, even the individual frameworks, from Teresa Torres, I use her opportunity solution tree, or like I take Marty Kagan's vision setting template.
66
And so, like, I only discovered these things.
67
So, what is an opportunity solution tree?
68
And how do you use it?
69
It's a way to map from symptom to root cause.
70
And I think one of the biggest challenges that revenue leaders have is we solve things at a surface level, and oftentimes, we just like reason by analogy.
71
We see a best practice on a podcast or something like that, and then we slap that into our business.
72
And we don't ask ourselves the question: okay, win rates are low because of rep execution.
73
So, we'll go fix rep execution.
74
Well, why is there a training efficiency?
75
Why, why, why, why, why?
76
And you can sort of map from this opportunity solution tree from like symptoms all the way back to root cause.
77
And oftentimes, with this tree, you get back to the root cause, and then actually, there's something else to fix there.
78
Instead of like, we just need to update the scripting, well, you might get up to this top opportunity, this root cause, and then actually find, because you're trying to think of like, okay, what are the other ways that I could solve this opportunity?
79
And it just forces you to more deeply ideate and solve problems more foundationally, I find.
80
I love that.
81
I find a lot of the time we need frameworks.
82
A lot of times it's like we need just clarity to understand the next step.
83
I want to start, dude, on something you said to me before.
84
You said revenue leaders spend way too little time here and don't think about it strategically when it comes to recruiting and talent development.
85
If we start at the beginning of the funnel, sourcing, what are your biggest lessons on what it takes to source amazing sales talent?
86
So, number one, I think revenue leaders need to see this as one of the most core components of their job.
87
Oftentimes, they look at this as the realm of TA, and it's the talent team's job to bring them candidates.
88
Let's post jobs, we'll put it on a bunch of boards, and then we'll see what we get from there.
89
And that's just totally backwards, in my opinion.
90
Revenue leaders, especially if you're trying to operate at a pretty dynamic scale, this needs to be something that you're spending a massive part of your day on or thinking very deeply and strategically about it.
91
Because many of these bets have long, long time horizons on them.
92
So, like content.
93
So, I've been writing on LinkedIn for six, seven years.
94
I've amassed a bit of a following.
95
And so, in the early days of owner, I could post a role, we would get 1,200.
96
And then that was picking from an incredible funnel of people who I'm basically sourcing myself.
97
Was the quality high?
98
Yeah, for sure.
99
Because these are all people that are one and two degrees connected to me and then working referral networks really, really hard.
100
Because everybody I know sees that.
101
My whole network sees it, and they know the quality of what I do.
102
And if I'm putting my name on this new company, they're like, oh, that's probably a good opportunity.
103
And sure enough, a former BDR of mine introduced me to his cousin.
104
His cousin was our first BDR, and he's like an absolute savage.
105
This is a guy named Brayden.
106
Then, from that same company, now there's nine people that work at owner.
107
Wow, I bet they're thrilled with you.
108
When did you join owner in terms of sales team stage?
109
There was a manager and four reps.
110
Manager and four reps.
111
Yeah, we parted ways with two of those reps fairly quickly.
112
And then we've built to 60 folks in sales today.
113
Wow.
114
Okay, let's go back to that.
115
So, Adam starts the sales process.
116
Does the founder need to be the one to build that sales playbook?
117
So, not to get into semantics, but it really depends on what you mean by playbook.
118
Basically, a framework for what customers want, where they get it, how to message them, and what a standard sales cycle looks like with a price average.
119
If that's what we're calling a playbook, then yeah, I firmly believe so.
120
I don't think you can outsource that to a new VP of sales from the outside.
121
I mean, I hear you talking about this all the time.
122
I hear the range of opinions, but unless a founder can do that, I don't think that they're going to understand the customer in enough depth.
123
This is a Toby thing.
124
You know, he talks a lot about compressing the.
125
How can you make sure that the entire organization is as close to the frontline, as close to the customer as possible, and not have these massive chains of information that are oftentimes diluted?
126
So I think if you're a founder trying to outsource that, you're not really going to be able to build the rest of the organization if you have so little understanding of what persuades a customer.
127
So I think you should build the basics of it, and then a sales leader can come in and build all the rest.
128
What was wrong with the first two reps?
129
Like a lesson from that?
130
What do you see most founders make a mistake on when they're hiring those first reps?
131
They just want anybody in seat.
132
I had this conversation with the founder I advised yesterday and pushed him on it, even though it's uncomfortable.
133
I'm like, look, you know, this guy's got a jumpy resume.
134
I know that you want somebody in seat really, really badly.
135
And he's got some relevant experience, but he's probably not your guy.
136
And I know that advice sucks to hear because you've been trying to fill this seat, but it's so tempting to just try to get a body there.
137
And it's so hard to recruit when you're an early stage startup with no traction, no brand equity, but you just have to hold a really high bar.
138
And the pain of getting it wrong is so significant because you'll spend three months searching, six months with them, and then three months searching again, and you're like nine months down and you've got nowhere.
139
It's one of these lessons, like the founder sort of has to touch the hot stove to really learn that one sometimes.
140
When I'm doing early stage advisory, this is one of the things I'm trying to press on as much as possible.
141
Like don't take that shortcut.
142
So for sales leaders, you mentioned going back to the sourcing side because I do want to go to the funnel of this.
143
Should every sales leader have a brand and be creating content?
144
Because without it, you wouldn't have that sourcing funnel.
145
Again, if we go back to first principle, you need some sourcing mechanism.
146
Like it's the same as you as a VC.
147
One of your comparative advantages is a massive.
148
And so they can solve that problem separately, but they need to be able to source candidates.
149
You need to be able to create your own funnel.
150
So, another example would be: you came out of an incredible sales division at Databricks or at wherever you name it, and you've got the best mafia of knowledge from 500 salespeople.
151
You can bring some people with you, or if you don't really have those advantages, you have to just go grind it out and you have to build really compelling messaging, and you're sending those LinkedIn messages yourself, and your hit rate's going to be lower, but you got to do it.
152
I have long believed that building audience has compounding advantages.
153
As we've seen, like you're a perfect example of that.
154
And so, I got to work on that like six, seven years ago, and now it pays off like crazy.
155
You said the next stage of the funnel is scorecard.
156
Can you talk to me about scorecard and how you think it builds into building the best sales team?
157
This comes back to systems engineering.
158
It comes back to like, do you have a programmatic way to identify the right talent on a consistent basis in a way that you can then have somebody else do it?
159
Or is this all going to fall apart as soon as you hand it off to your first sales manager or first VP of sales?
160
And so, for us, I've been using the framework of the same scorecard for five to eight years, and I've iterated on it over time.
161
But it has three components: one is DNA, it's mindset.
162
So, what are the intangibles and the things that are fairly intrinsic to the individual?
163
The second piece of that is craft.
164
What does their sales craft look like?
165
And then the third piece is specific knowledge.
166
And depending on the type of sales role that you're filling, your weighting is going to be different.
167
I'm hiring SMB reps, so I'm like 70% DNA and mindset.
168
I just want people who have a performance track record of excellence.
169
And I don't care if it was sales or the valedictorian, captain of a sports team, first chair tuba at their like, you know, local orchestra.
170
Like when you do things, do you do it at a really high level?
171
Are they curious?
172
Are they coachable?
173
Are they an absolute grinder?
174
Do they have resilience?
175
There's a bunch in there.
176
And because I'm hiring folks that are early in their careers, 70 to honestly 80% can be just like DNA and I'll teach them the rest.
177
I feel really confident in our sales training program.
178
That's different if you're hiring enterprise.
179
If you're trying hiring legit multi-million dollar quota-carrying enterprise reps, you're going to be much more craft and specific knowledge weighted.
180
So if you're Databricks, you might have great craft, but you probably need really specific expertise or they're going to have a hard time getting up to speed because it's a highly technical product.
181
You need that credibility.
182
My framework is relatively the same, but my weighting will change depending on the role that I'm hiring for.
183
Have you made Ms.
184
High as an owner?
185
Oh, yeah.
186
When you reflect on them, what should you have seen that you didn't see?
187
Something that we've doubled down on recently is references and not taking any excuses for not being able to get the exact references that we want.
188
What mistakes did you make?
189
They gave you references and they were okay.
190
Or it was not their direct manager.
191
It was like a manager from another team and we just sort of accepted it because we were trying to move too fast.
192
And now really pressing on like, no, no, no, I need your last two direct managers.
193
Maybe not the one they work for now for obvious reasons, but being really specific there.
194
And if there's any hesitation or, oh, well, like, I don't know if I can get in touch with them.
195
You know, that's a massive red flag.
196
We really want to stress on references.
197
Develop that one.
198
And so you didn't get the references, maybe, and they turned out to be not as good, not as strategic, not as good at sales, not as good at work ethic.
199
Where did they fall down that you should have seen?
200
So there were two scenarios like this.
201
One, yeah, it was about values and work approach.
202
We have a company value called Bring Good Energy, and it seems really cheesy, but I think when you're working as hard as we do and you're trying to build something generational, you actually do need people that are going to bring positivity, optimism, enthusiasm so that the organization just has a certain mindset.
203
And that wasn't the case.
204
And luckily, this was in person.
205
I caught this on day 11.
206
I was like, hey, this doesn't work.
207
Like, we're done here.
208
You will cut it that soon.
209
Wow.
210
Yeah, yeah.
211
For things that I don't deem to be coachable, yeah, I'm going to try to make a call there ASAP.
212
Same thing a couple of companies ago.
213
There was somebody in the onboarding program who was treating our enablement leader really flippantly and wasn't taking it that seriously.
214
He was a little rude.
215
I just said, get rid of him.
216
If you're already treating this person, you're like supposed to be in your best behavior in weeks, you know, in the early weeks and months.
217
And if that's how that person acts today, then it's only going to be worse later.
218
Can you help me?
219
I join ONA.
220
I'm a BDR, SDR, whatever I am, but I'm a junior.
221
What does my first week look like?
222
I think training is done so badly, and often we don't set them up for success.
223
Yeah.
224
What have been your lessons on how to do that really well?
225
Structurally, we have invested very, very heavily in this.
226
I think one of the things that people find surprising about our business is the headcount allocations.
227
So we've got 26 AEs and 30-something BDRs, and there's five people in enablement.
228
Some of those support other functions like our on.
229
We've had enablement since way earlier than most people would tell you.
230
How many in enablement?
231
Five total.
232
Five in enablement.
233
And what's that core role?
234
Program building.
235
And then some of it is delivery.
236
Our sales enablement manager, he actually runs all of onboarding for new reps.
237
It doesn't really fall to the manager all that much.
238
Okay.
239
Because the managers are running a million miles a minute, trying to hit the number every single month.
240
And we're bringing in new cohorts of reps every single month between like five and ten people.
241
We have built and rebuilt a bunch of times this onboarding program.
242
So week one is mostly remote and asynchronous.
243
So they're listening to calls, there's baseline product training, there's stuff about the company.
244
They really get to know our methodology.
245
And then week two, everybody comes in person to Toronto now.
246
And we're doing much more practical application.
247
Some of that is done through this tool, Avara, which is like an AI sales simulator that we use.
248
So they're getting tons and tons of practice reps in the sales simulator.
249
And then they're doing live-fire reps with our sales enablement manager.
250
And so really like practical application.
251
They're building an owner restaurant themselves.
252
They're finding a prospect and doing all the pre-call research.
253
Then they're running a mock demo on that exact customer.
254
It's very, very practical.
255
Then they graduate into the team.
256
Sorry, I have so many questions.
257
I just want to break them down.
258
But week one, remote async.
259
Fascinating.
260
Do you record all calls?
261
I think there's so much value in calls.
262
How do you use calls effectively for training?
263
So we have a hall of fame of calls.
264
And I think the important thing is it's not just an entire call.
265
Oftentimes it's call snippets.
266
We use Momentum, which is our call recorder, and it's this AI tool that we can find the parts of calls.
267
So, how to open a call, how to introduce.
268
We have clips for that, how to ask good discovery questions and go two to three levels deeper.
269
You've got examples for that, value prop, how to ask for the sale.
270
It's like all scripted to the word.
271
Can we not just hire some monkeys if we just have everything?
272
I know, I mean it in the nicest way, but if we have everything, like this is how to open a call, this is how to ask if they're the buyer, this is how to multi-thread.
273
Fuck me, AI can do that.
274
I don't believe so yet, and for the next little while, here's my big thing: scripting: scripting the basics enables you to offload that cognitive work.
275
If I'm just thinking about where to take this call next and I don't have a pattern that I've repeated all of these different times, I'm spending all of my cognitive load on low-level stuff.
276
Instead, what I need to be thinking of is: okay, so these are the things I learned from my discovery, so this is how I'm going to tailor that in the demo now.
277
And I know this is going to be an issue, and I want to ask this question later.
278
So, I've got a note about that.
279
I think you can spend your mental energy on higher-order things if you are executing a really like repeatable process.
280
It's the same thing with sports teams.
281
Unless you are highly regimented and rigorous and drilled on all of the basics, you can't worry about the most sophisticated tactics and strategies.
282
Okay, so week one, they are absolutely taking the notebook and pen out on momentum and learning basically the playbook of what's worked.
283
And going through our learning management system, so everything is broken down into modules with specific content and then the examples.
284
So, we don't just throw them into the call library.
285
In the nicest way, do you find that effective?
286
I mean, I've never met anyone who likes a learning manager.
287
It's going to get a good facelift.
288
And we move them fast.
289
They are getting through a lot and there's check-ins pretty consistently.
290
And they know week two is practical application.
291
So they have to be ready for it.
292
So week two, they head to Canada.
293
Okay.
294
So are we fully in person?
295
No, no, no.
296
We still operate primarily as a remote company.
297
And then there's certain roles that we're bringing back into office.
298
I don't think you need your staff software engineers in an office to do to do their job well.
299
I agree.
300
Do you not think you need sales teams in person?
301
All of our new SDR and BDR hires are five days a week in office in Toronto now.
302
Yeah, I was about to say, I think it's the most important thing.
303
And of our recent cohorts, the two newest SDRs both broke the first month record for EMRR sourced.
304
So what's EMR?
305
Estimated monthly recurring revenue.
306
Okay.
307
Because there's subscription plus transaction revenue.
308
So we have an estimate.
309
The two new ones broke the record for the first month.
310
The newest BDR in person broke the record for the first month.
311
And then the SDRs that are at month two and three both broke the previous records.
312
This is the purely in-person team.
313
So clearly there's been a sizable impact just having them all around one another, sitting next to their managers.
314
I'm in the office a whole bunch.
315
I wasn't really supposed to be in the office, but I'm there like three, four days a week just because it's awesome.
316
Yeah.
317
No, I listen, I totally agree.
318
I think you need to be.
319
Can I ask what are the ACVs?
320
I know with transaction, it's tougher, but like blended.
321
Like 89K.
322
A year.
323
How do you do like an outbound sales motion with really low ACVs?
324
Instrumentation.
325
Common wisdom would tell you.
326
People aren't thinking from first principles.
327
Okay, well, why don't you think that's possible?
328
Well, they can't close enough transactions to get that much MRR on a per-person basis.
329
Well, why not?
330
Well, if you really look at it, reps and BDRs spend 50% of their time doing nonsense, doing account research and finding leads and filling out their CRM.
331
Is that nonsense?
332
It's not very valuable.
333
It's valuable at a macro level, but it's not valuable on an individual revenue generation perspective.
334
And so we automate all that.
335
So BDRs don't do any lead research.
336
We centrally manage every lead, every record, do all of the enrichment.
337
What do you use for lead research?
338
So we built in-house a whole ton of our own tools.
339
Now we also use this company called DataLane.
340
They're like Zoom info for SMB, essentially.
341
And through DataLane, we get 95% of our leads mobile enriched.
342
So now the economics of your team changed drastically.
343
If you previously, before we went on this mobile enrichment campaign, our call to decision maker connect was like 3%.
344
So you'd have to make 100 calls to talk to three decision makers.
345
Yeah, you can't scale.
346
It's worse if you're going mid-market or selling to corporate.
347
Why is it so bad?
348
Well, you'd have to be calling a restaurant line, not an office line.
349
People don't pick up their office phone anymore either way.
350
But now our call to DMC is like 13 to 16%.
351
How?
352
Because we have mobile phone numbers for everybody.
353
So you're calling somebody's cell phone.
354
And so now a BDR making 100 calls can talk to 16 people and be booking two meetings a day every single day with.
355
With good win rates, now two meetings a day, every BDR, half of those closing at like a 9K ACV, the numbers start to really add up.
356
Wow, that's fascinating.
357
What percent of converted sales are cold calls?
358
Much less today.
359
So we've gone back and forth.
360
When I started, we were 90% inbound, and then at some point we were.
361
90% inbound.
362
Wow.
363
And then at some point, we were 70% outbound.
364
And then we hired a new head of growth who's done an amazing job.
365
And now we're 60% new inbound.
366
And then we prospect into the base.
367
So former inbounds, the BDRs will go after, plus some cold outbound.
368
Plus, we've got a partner channel now.
369
So there's a channel diversity.
370
So it's ebbed and flowed over the years.
371
And it will continue to do that.
372
This is why it is so important to have a multi-channel strategy, in my opinion, so that as certain channels hit saturation or find challenges, you've got other places to go.
373
When did you go multi-channel?
374
Because I think people can go too broad too soon.
375
Really early.
376
We built an outbound team in Q4 of 2022, and I started in June.
377
So pretty quickly.
378
If you want to do an outbound team, well, I'm a founder and I'm like, that girl, I need an outbound team.
379
What would you advise me?
380
Depends on a lot.
381
Depends on the market and what you're trying to accomplish.
382
I think some generic advice is overpay for a BDR who's really good and then give them a path to account executive.
383
There's a lot of companies that are stagnant and there's a lot of BDRs who are quite good that don't necessarily have that path to AE where they're at.
384
Can I be a dick?
385
Where do the best BDRs come from?
386
Where do not good BDRs come from?
387
You can find good BDRs everywhere.
388
I like Jason's advice.
389
Go to a company that's not number one in their category.
390
Who's the number one?
391
Because that's hard.
392
And if you have a great product and you bring that person into your environment, they'll do really, really well.
393
We've hired a bunch of people.
394
You know, that company where we've hired nine people from, that's a mediocre product in a very competitive market.
395
And those people are well-trained salespeople that come into our environment and they rip because our product's great.
396
And so now they have, you know, good sales craft.
397
They've got the grit.
398
And now you marry that with a number one product in this category and people will take off.
399
Okay.
400
And so I just want to go back.
401
So we have like this data enrichment layer, which is super smart.
402
And so when we look at the economics, when it's 9K, you know, I go back to Chris Dagnan, actually, who we both know.
403
And he said that basically you can only have six to eight calls a week.
404
When you think about that, for you, obviously, yours is a much higher volume scheme.
405
Yeah.
406
How does yours differ?
407
So in Chris's context, there will be so much pre-call research and post-call work and coordination and quarterbacking.
408
Like I've sold enterprise before.
409
So I think that makes sense.
410
We aim to have roughly four demos booked per AE per day with three held.
411
We know that there's going to be some meetings.
412
Three demos per day.
413
Every day, yeah.
414
Wow.
415
So they're going to do 10 to 12 calls a day.
416
Three demos a day plus probably two to four follow-up calls from previous pipeline.
417
We also close a ton of calls on the first demo.
418
We're doing a bunch of analysis right now to figure out exactly what that marginal point is.
419
How many net new lead calls do you think your team have a week?
420
Hundreds, for sure.
421
Yeah, because 26 account executives, they're probably.
422
But each of them, do they do 20 a week each?
423
10 to 20, probably.
424
12 to 18, I bet.
425
Every you said they need to have three demos a day.
426
Yeah, so the and the BDRs are booking those for them.
427
Ah, got you.
428
Okay, got you.
429
Okay, so the BDRs book them, how many BDRs do we have?
430
35-ish.
431
And so 35 book three net new each.
432
We'll call it two.
433
Call it two.
434
Two each.
435
Yeah.
436
Wow.
437
Inbound is different than outbound.
438
So those, it's two net new for outbound is one and a half to two.
439
Inbound is a lot more than that.
440
Inbound, they could be doing five to ten because it's it's uh higher intent.
441
Should AEs be responsible for pipeline generation?
442
In SMB, I don't think so.
443
In general, I think relying on account executives to prospect is probably a losing proposition.
444
Why would you pay a 250K rep money to make cold calls when you could potentially have an 80k BDR do that work for you if they're good at it?
445
I think account executives, especially mid-market enterprise, have to do some prospecting, but it's not banging the phones.
446
No offense.
447
BDRs, if they're paid that shit, which respectfully they are, aren't you always just going to get bad people?
448
No offense.
449
And again, like, they're the front line of your company.
450
How do you think about effective BDR hiring given they are more junior?
451
They are the future leaders of our industry and our company.
452
We hire super high-caliber people that have a ton of potential.
453
And so you've got to do a lot of training.
454
But this is the point of their career that they're at.
455
And 80K is awesome for them.
456
And they have a path to 100 and 150 within two years.
457
You're 22 years old.
458
That's awesome.
459
I don't necessarily think it's like a bad comp.
460
How do you think about target settings then?
461
Because I always think that incentives can be gamified.
462
So you can do like demos booked.
463
Sure, but I could just fudge the qualification process and get you a load of donut shops that are shitting going out of business.
464
Not going to help.
465
So our BDRs only get paid on close one business.
466
Alignment.
467
Our account executives only get paid when their customers go live.
468
We are month-to-month contracts.
469
So we want to make sure that our account executives are doing high-quality handoffs, setting good expectations, or closing high-quality customers.
470
And so, again, they are highly incentivized to make sure that those customers are good so that they go live.
471
And that holders doesn't include transaction revenue.
472
It does.
473
It includes an estimate.
474
So we have these two machine learning models.
475
One is eGPV.
476
So it's an estimated gross payments volume.
477
So we scoop in a bunch of information from them online and we can make an estimate of how much they'll actually do on our platform.
478
And so that goes into their comp so that we're rewarding them for closing the highest quality deals because there is a spread.
479
Wow.
480
Does that ever get you in trouble?
481
And what I mean by that is: say a chain goes out of business and you paid comp on estimated volume and actually they didn't hit it.
482
They're way off it.
483
Not happening.
484
You'll win some, you'll lose some.
485
It all comes out in the wash.
486
We feel really good about our economics.
487
And we know that when we changed comp to include eGBV, which means they are going to be more focused on the higher value customers for the business, our estimated MRR on a per deal basis went up pretty significantly.
488
What is a good ratio?
489
Say you pay an AE, I'm just making it up like 200K.
490
Is it five to one?
491
Is it in terms of like revenue booked?
492
What is good?
493
Depends on company stage.
494
Early, you probably won't get that.
495
More.
496
So what are you at?
497
A good account executive, like our inbound account executives close 250K ARR every month.
498
Wow.
499
So it's a little different because we're not.
500
That means they basically close a client a day.
501
Yeah, or more, more in a lot of cases.
502
Wow.
503
Efficiency.
504
This is the thing.
505
So when people talk about, well, you know, one of the things that surprises people is on the outbound side, we have two BDRs for every account executive.
506
Oh, that makes no sense in SMB.
507
Well, it does if on a per BDR basis, the LTV CAC is really strong and then you're closing a high percentage of those deals.
508
Again, this goes back to first principles.
509
As a revenue leader, do you really understand your PL inside out and backwards?
510
And do you understand the inputs and outputs of your unit economics?
511
Where do most revenue leaders misunderstand their PL?
512
They don't even understand it.
513
They don't know where to start.
514
They think it's the domain of finance.
515
And finance gives them a headcount number and they say, you have 17 reps and you have to do this.
516
And they say, okay.
517
Or they get the number and they just complain about it.
518
But they don't really understand sell by sell.
519
The ARR model that we have, I understand it sell by sell.
520
Every single input, because I own demand, gen and growth as well.
521
And so I have to connect all of these things to make sure that not only this month, but six months out, we have the right trajectory for all of these things to ladder up to the number.
522
What's our AQL forecast from growth?
523
What is the confidence interval that we're getting to this number by this date?
524
Okay, what are the redundancies we have in place?
525
And I'm always trying to layer in more than I actually anticipate we'll need.
526
But then, on an input-by-input basis, you have to have a high degree of proficiency, or else you get surprised.
527
This is what ends up happening to a lot of first-time VPs of sales: they go into a quarter, they don't have enough pipeline, and they go, oh, we have to generate like an extra $4 million in pipe and close it at a 25%, but our deal cycles 120 days, you're cooked.
528
There's no way to recover.
529
You made that mistake six months ago.
530
And so, unless you really understand the model and are able to think both about today and delivering what's happening right now and be thinking six and 12 months into the future, you really struggle.
531
What channel has outperformed expectations, and what do you learn from that?
532
Organic, probably.
533
What do you think you did well to inspire organic to do so well?
534
I did nothing.
535
Never start with that.
536
Always, it was me, it's the takeaway, but yes.
537
Yeah, this was a founder insight.
538
This is Adam having an incredibly deep understanding of the customer and the market.
539
And way before it made economic sense, he was all in on organic.
540
Adam just has like such an intuitive understanding of our customer base, and he was like, We're all in on YouTube.
541
We are going to be the central hub for restaurant marketing.
542
No one owns this position online.
543
And so, we hired people that manage the YouTube experience for like the biggest creators in the entire world.
544
And we were paying millions of dollars for this organic strategy when it was driving like a handful of leads every single month.
545
That's a really bold leader because you have to basically be comfortable losing money without guarantee that the rewards will come.
546
Yeah, long payoff time horizon, but compounding.
547
And we're only in the early innings of getting great at this.
548
And people will come inbound and be like, I've watched 12 hours of Adam's YouTube.
549
Like, here's my credit card.
550
That happens fairly frequently.
551
And we weave his content into our onboarding journey, into customer marketing.
552
This channel seemed like a crazy bet at the time.
553
And I knew better than to second-guess this one.
554
Like, Adam just has an ability to see ahead and make a bet.
555
And when he does that, he's almost always right.
556
Do you not think this is when marketing completely blends with sales though?
557
Because actually, so many, you have outbound, sure, but outbound is made far more successful when you outbound to someone who already watches your videos.
558
100%.
559
This is something that a lot of folks get wrong: they like squabble over attribution.
560
They're like, oh, this is sales generated.
561
This is marketing generated.
562
And you end up at these local maximas.
563
And we have a sort of a strange org structure where our VP of marketing, who owns brand and PMM, and customer marketing, rolls directly into Adam.
564
I own growth and demand gen.
565
You would think, like, oh, that's a little squirrely.
566
And it works awesome.
567
And everybody collaborates, and it's a really productive structure.
568
And my growth leader doesn't worry about like organic attribution.
569
Neither does the VP of marketing.
570
They understand that a ton of organic is actually driven by the paid marketing halo.
571
So we don't worry about it.
572
What channel has sucked when you thought it would be good?
573
We just tried CTV and didn't have a ton of success with it.
574
Connected TV.
575
C TV.
576
Connected TV.
577
So running pre-roll ads on Amazon Prime or the like set-top boxes.
578
What do you think happened there?
579
Really, what happened is we've got too many other things that are successful.
580
You know, we're going to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on these channels to try to figure it out.
581
And we know that not all of them will take off immediately.
582
And that's totally okay.
583
You know, you've got to think in bets, Annie Duke.
584
The world is probabilistic and some of these will work and some of these will won't, some of these won't, and we're going to triple down on the winners.
585
What are your sales cycles?
586
A lot of one-call closes, but average sales cycles under a week.
587
Under a week.
588
How is that the case?
589
I mean that with the most respectful, that is extraordinary.
590
It's a compelling product.
591
That helps and it's a burning platform for people.
592
Like we are helping them make money, which is very important.
593
So if folks are willing to move on it.
594
But something else we do that I think helps a ton, the style of selling that I teach is radically transparent selling.
595
At the beginning of every demo, what we lead with is both the strengths and weaknesses of the product.
596
So like one of the first things I'll say to a customer when I'm on call is, so I feature dump number one, which everybody tells you not to do.
597
But I actually think people talk in such weird abstractions that customers don't understand it.
598
I'll be like, okay, we do five things.
599
Website, online ordering, email, text message, marketing, custom-branded app, listing management, all rolled into one.
600
So that's like the product.
601
But here's what you need to know about what's different than us and our competitors.
602
We are going to give you way less flexibility and customization.
603
If that's your main priority, owner is probably not a good fit.
604
But in exchange for sacrificing this flexibility, you're going to get way better results.
605
And why that is, is because we have thousands and thousands of these restaurant customers and we're constantly doing experiments and A-B tests.
606
And the things that work, we're going to roll out to every single customer.
607
And we're not even going to ask you some of the time.
608
Legitimately, the best restaurant marketers in the world and some of the best restaurant marketing technologists are working constantly on your behalf to do one thing and one thing only, which is make you money.
609
You make more money, do way less work, but if you've got a custom font that you really love or you want videos everywhere and a spinning pizza sign at the top of the website, you have like really strong brand opinions, then it's not really going to work.
610
And so what happens is the wrong customers opt out immediately.
611
And so you're not wasting a bunch of time in sales cycles.
612
And the thing that drags on your total sales cycles is actually time to lose more often than it is time to win.
613
But because we lead with that transparency up front, what you notice is that you're starting that conversation with massive trust with the restaurant.
614
This is like the four-star review thing from Tacopony.
615
Like people don't trust brands that have only five stars.
616
They actually have a higher trust in four stars.
617
I'm leading with strengths and weaknesses.
618
So now people are trusting the rest of what we say.
619
And we're really honest.
620
When you're selling to SMB and mum and pop, how many want customization?
621
Some for sure.
622
Really?
623
Yeah.
624
And we have some larger brands, 10, 20, 30 location brands now, many who have grown up on us.
625
You know, we've helped them be so successful that they've franchised, they've opened a whole ton of locations.
626
Do you have a constant internal battle of how far into enterprise you go?
627
It's surprisingly easy because we're committed to the mission and we're committed to this product philosophy.
628
We're not against working with a 30-location brand, but we are against working with a brand that wants high degrees of customization.
629
More of those brands are going to want more flexibility and choice and are going to are.
630
But, you know, we closed a 33 location chain the other day and they came to us and they're like, yeah, I don't want to deal with all this stuff.
631
I just want somebody else to figure it out for me.
632
Okay, great.
633
Here.
634
But if you look at Olo, if we're blunt, why are they not a good business where you are?
635
They're playing a different game.
636
They're playing a very different game.
637
I'm sorry, I'm naive.
638
How so?
639
Well, they're way up market.
640
They're trying to win enterprise brands and they're trying to play the customization and flexibility and the headless game and tons of cost pressure there from these major franchises.
641
I don't know that it's a bad business, but they're just doing something completely different.
642
We don't cross over with them hardly at all.
643
When you look at how you run your internal processes today, there's real velocity/slash action to your sales cycles.
644
They're very fast compared to others.
645
How do you do pipeline generation meetings?
646
How do you do deal reviews?
647
What are the staple meetings in the sales week at ONA?
648
So we don't do pipeline review.
649
Okay.
650
Why?
651
We don't do deal review.
652
Why?
653
Because you can just see it on a dashboard.
654
It's all programmatic.
655
At the beginning of the month, I can basically tell you where we're going to land because I look at what is coming in top of funnel from marketing.
656
What do we project from the BDR team?
657
And we can drive to that number.
658
So it's really about butts and seats, ramp, the average attainment.
659
You can mathematically just figure out where that's going to be.
660
So oftentimes I can tell you that from dashboards.
661
I don't need to do a bottoms up.
662
What's your confidence level on this deal?
663
Like that makes no sense in SMB.
664
Enterprise, obviously, it does.
665
And you're going to do a weekly scrutiny on every deal and stress testing it.
666
But for us, I can understand everything I need about the business basically from Salesforce.
667
What's your ramp time on that on New A's?
668
We wanted AEs to start in the role better trained.
669
We used to put people on the phones on day five and now it's like day 11 or 12 because again, the deal doesn't matter unless it launches.
670
And so if you are a new rep and you're saying a bunch of stuff that's like sort of not accurate, then you get into launch and they're like, wait, I didn't know about this and this and this.
671
Then the trust is completely broken.
672
And oftentimes people will pull out again because we're contracting month to month.
673
Does that matter though?
674
And what I mean by that is your pool of net new leads is so large compared to insurance SaaS business where they sell to enterprise where there's like, don't fuck up a lead here, dude.
675
Like you can't afford to.
676
Do you not bluntly have such a big universe that like you can get them on the call earlier and not fuck it up?
677
There's still an opportunity cost because we've paid money to generate that opportunity that another more seasoned rep could have closed.
678
Both inbound and outbound.
679
That's true.
680
And so we're also mindful of the reputational risk as well.
681
And we want people to be really successful and competent.
682
If you throw them in way too early, then sometimes it actually stunts their growth.
683
Do you do shadowing?
684
Like will you draw, will sales leaders drawing calls for the first call, second call, third call?
685
Oh yeah, big time.
686
Talk to me about that because again, dude, I've never run a sales team.
687
That's why these shows are successful because I ask the questions that everyone who has no idea what they're doing asks too.
688
How do you do that?
689
When do you hand off?
690
The reps will go through the training and they do a bunch of the sales simulation, then mock calls.
691
They get certified.
692
They get certified on the craft and then they do an operator certification, which is like, do you know how to use Salesforce and all the other stuff?
693
And then their first calls, the managers are on all of them, basically.
694
And you'll give the rep more and more rope as they show competence.
695
So maybe at the beginning, all the rep can do is open the call, ask a few discovery questions, do a little bit of the demo before they get that Diren headlights look, and then the manager can jump in and take it over.
696
So we see a lot of like manager-close deals in that first couple of weeks.
697
In the nicest way, how sophisticated are the clients?
698
And what I mean by that is: if you're a mom-and-pop shop with maybe a couple of Chinese stores or a couple of Indian rationals, are you really like jumping onto like sales demo calls from a plush office, being like, oh, thank you, Carl and Jessica?
699
Lovely to see you.
700
Or you're like, hey, why are you bothering me?
701
Yeah.
702
Fuck off.
703
A lot of people are joining the Google Meet from their phone.
704
They're in the back office.
705
Smoking a dart is not an uncommon experience on our demos for sure.
706
And so, like, yeah, these are salt of the earth mom and pop business owners.
707
We'll meet the customer wherever we need to meet them.
708
How important is it to go in person?
709
We don't do any in-person.
710
You don't do any in person?
711
A la bruble.
712
Why?
713
The economics don't make sense.
714
We're so efficient running the sales cycle digitally.
715
I'm not being rude.
716
If you go to like a highly dense metropolitan area, is there not like 50 mom and pop shops in a square?
717
So we are highly targeted.
718
I mentioned that we have these two ML models, one that tells us the size of that potential restaurant.
719
So like how much revenue they'll do.
720
And we have this thing called an e-win score.
721
And so that's our estimated win rate.
722
Wow, this is fascinating.
723
What size restaurant is interesting?
724
So we don't want little tiny restaurants that are just like scraping by and have no colour.
725
So, they're doing like 500K to 5 million.
726
Yeah.
727
And so, we know that there's certain GPV bands where churn starts to tick up.
728
So, we say, okay, like, this is our minimum for this segment.
729
And then we have this estimated win rate.
730
So, you could knock on 50 doors.
731
Don't laugh.
732
Is the likelihood of closure greater in different cuisine types?
733
So, like, if your GPV is under 300 grand for Indian, but under 700 grand for Italian, is it different in that way?
734
I don't know.
735
We haven't run that analysis.
736
It would be fascinating to see that.
737
Oh, the Italians, they close under a million.
738
The Chinese, they're better on 500K.
739
Yeah.
740
We look at all sorts of stuff: churn by cuisine type, churn by size, churn by the quality of their setup.
741
Like everything in our business is instrumented so that we can understand it in a lot of depth.
742
Gotcha, because you don't want to spend a ton of resources if the churn's super high.
743
Okay.
744
And so, going back to your question about in-person, a rep on our team that is getting, you know, three to four demos a day and closing one or two of those and then being able to chase down all of their follow-ups, it's really hard to compete with the efficiency of that model knocking on doors.
745
Some of those doors are relevant, some of those doors don't meet our scoring model.
746
Most of the time, the owner's not there.
747
You're now like feet on the street.
748
It's just a ton of time.
749
And our competitors who run that model, we're anywhere between like three and four times more productive on a per rep basis than most companies.
750
The thing that really shines through for me from this conversation is like a velocity engine of a sales machine.
751
Do you know what I mean?
752
Which is like very systematized and very scientific.
753
Yeah.
754
It's fascinating.
755
So we have that with different states.
756
I mean, how fast did you scale to 10 million in revenue?
757
What were you at when you joined?
758
Two and a half.
759
You're at two and a half.
760
We're at like 40 today.
761
Yeah.
762
Fucking this.
763
Under three years.
764
Yeah.
765
And we're actually growing faster today than three years to 40 million.
766
Yeah, two and a half to that.
767
Yeah.
768
And we're actually growing faster today.
769
And so I'm very optimistic about what this year will bring.
770
Does customer acquisition get cheaper over time because you have brand, you have word of mouth, you have a humming sales and marketing team?
771
Or does it get more expansive as you expand beyond your core ICP?
772
It depends.
773
So it depends on how big the market is.
774
I think many markets, you hit a saturation point and you've closed the low-hanging fruit, the early adopters, and you see sales and marketing costs rise.
775
It's falling pretty rapidly for us.
776
We're getting more and more efficient as we grow.
777
But we've also made tremendous investments up front.
778
RevOps, enablement, data, and BizOps.
779
Like these are, for anybody else looking at it, would think like these teams are way overweight for the size of team and the ARR we are at today.
780
But we've built these systems and foundations that are allowing us to get increasingly efficient.
781
And now as we bring in more and more reps and spend more and more in demand, gen, that flywheel is pretty tough to stop.
782
What is the biggest thing that RevOps has done to make a humming and efficient machine, do you think?
783
A few things.
784
So one is trying to automate and obfuscate all of the low-value stuff.
785
So we use momentum that looks at the transcript of every single sales call and it fills in the Salesforce fields for the rep.
786
All of that stuff that could take a rep a whole bunch of time to manually fill out.
787
That's all done for them.
788
We try to simplify the business process as much as we can for the reps.
789
And then tooling.
790
We're really insistent on trying to bring in tools that make the team more and more effective, both pre- and post-sales.
791
Like, I think sometimes the pre-sales gets all of the investment and post-sales doesn't.
792
But a company that I know you know is Pavlov.
793
And we were their first customer.
794
Yeah, Mark and I worked together very closely at Shopify.
795
I didn't know that.
796
I had dinner with them last night.
797
You know, we led their round.
798
I do.
799
Oh, wow.
800
Fantastic.
801
I should have known that.
802
I love him.
803
He's so good.
804
They're an awesome team.
805
I'm very bullish.
806
And so we're using a tool like Pavlov to post-sale, incentivize the customer to take actions that we know lead to higher GPV, higher retention.
807
And again, that's now an automated flow where they go through these campaigns of incentives.
808
They do the right things, not just for us, but for them as businesses.
809
How do you think about that?
810
How do you do that successfully?
811
Because, you know, as you said, there's the SaaS revenue, which is great, but also transaction revenue is a meaningful, meaningful part of it for you.
812
And so when you think about really ensuring customer success, what have been your biggest lessons in how to do that well?
813
Again, it goes back to data and infrastructure.
814
So one of the things that the BizOps team did is build a scoring model for customer configuration quality.
815
So it's called the growth potential score.
816
So they did a big regression analysis and we know exactly what things in the product.
817
And if a customer's making money, they're making us money and they're much, much higher retention.
818
So, we get paid back multiple times there.
819
So, we built this GP score, the VizOps team does.
820
And so, we now know what a really high-quality configuration looks like.
821
That information is available to the launch specialist.
822
So, as they're setting up, they can see their GP score, they can see all the GPs.
823
Sorry, what's a launch specialist?
824
An onboarding rep.
825
Okay, and so what do they do?
826
They set the customer up.
827
So, sales closes it, they pass it to the launch specialist, and they get access to their domain, their Google business profile.
828
They build the website, figure out their menu and photos, the integrations.
829
They're doing all of that work.
830
Wow, it's quite cheap, isn't it?
831
Like 500 bucks a month, if you actually think about it-six grand a year.
832
I'm with you, but for everything you get feels pretty good, it's a pretty good deal.
833
Yeah, and a bunch of these customers end up making, but I'm thinking like the margins are not great then.
834
Because if you've got like a launch specialist doing all of that shit, making menus, domains, making sure site's up to quality for them, they're happy with color schemes and the fonts.
835
They do a lot of launches every month on a per-person basis.
836
How many launches do they do?
837
Over 20 per person, plus they're Latin American-based.
838
Are they comped on a launch?
839
They are.
840
Yeah.
841
And going back to this growth potential score thing, so the launch specialist knows what they need to fix in the configuration so that that person is as successful as possible.
842
What are their photos?
843
What's the density of and quality of those photos?
844
What's the story we tell?
845
Do we have connection to their Google's business profile?
846
Or have we done all the business listings work?
847
All that stuff is, again, delivered programmatically.
848
You said they're LATAM-based.
849
Talk to me about that.
850
Are they internal resources?
851
Okay, why LATAM-based?
852
It's like a pricing arbitrage.
853
Yeah.
854
And on a per dollar basis, we get incredible talent.
855
There's an exciting opportunity in Latin America to not treat it as this like BPO at an arm's length type thing.
856
We've made them part of our team.
857
How?
858
Like, that's really hard to do.
859
Anything worth doing is hard to do.
860
We just did the work to go source.
861
And so we've got a really good recruiting team.
862
We like posted the roles and did all the normal stuff, but they were going and outbounding into these markets, looking at where are the hubs of potential talent.
863
So big American tech companies that probably are getting good talent, let's go source there.
864
And once we found the patterns and we interviewed hundreds and hundreds of people and found a system to basically identify good folks.
865
How many do you have in LATAM?
866
70 people, probably.
867
Wow.
868
How big is the company now?
869
Approaching 250.
870
Fuck.
871
What breaks with scale?
872
Everything.
873
Yeah.
874
I think one of the things that I am most hyper-paranoid of is the quality of leadership breaking.
875
Because I think once, you know, if there's a long period of time where tons of people reported directly into me, ICs did, and then managers did.
876
And so I was really close, like within arms reach of every person in the org.
877
And now there's multiple layers between me and any IC.
878
Is that good?
879
You know, we hear about founder mode and the importance of being close to customers.
880
Is that good to be having multiple layers between you and an IC who's then going to speak to a customer?
881
Well, I still get on demos almost every week.
882
You do?
883
Oh, yeah.
884
At the end of a month, I'll be on demos almost every single day, running calls with reps, jumping in if they need help, closing.
885
I love it.
886
It's fun for me, but also it's very important for me to keep my craft sharp and to know what's happening on the front lines.
887
And I got involved in all the biggest deals last month.
888
I was like, hey, anything above 10 locations, like get me in there.
889
That's what I'm going to prioritize.
890
And I ran a bunch of these calls, and the reps are like, oh, like you said this and this.
891
Like, I'm going to do that.
892
Can you send me, can you send me how you're thinking about it?
893
We like quickly sketched out some, because I've had these new ideas.
894
The best way to figure out if they work is just do them myself.
895
So I'm pretty intentional about staying connected.
896
My BDR manager rips dials himself.
897
The AE director runs demos still.
898
The new manager who started is going to be like an AE basically for his first 30 days and get like very, very close to the customer.
899
What bit of the machine keeps you up at night?
900
Talent acquisition.
901
Yeah, because it's really hard.
902
As specific as possible, I'm so sorry, but is it BDR acquisition?
903
Is it launch specialist acquisition?
904
It's the speed at which the number is growing in every single role.
905
Because at some point, my content engine, like basically me cranking LinkedIn, will only get us so far.
906
And so we need new channels.
907
And I'm trying to make sure that we have these new sourcing channels lit up before we hit a point where it's like, oh man, we're supposed to have seven people starting, we only have three, and then you're starting to take action and it's sort of too late.
908
I just did a university tour.
909
I went and spoke at all the best business schools in and around the GTA as part of like a new way to source candidates.
910
And we have seven new SDRs starting next month just from this and then another four in July.
911
And so, again, like it comes back to this theme of how.
912
Jason always just tells me, listen, young people just don't want to work today.
913
Like, they just don't want to work.
914
Does that chime true with your perspective?
915
I think, in general, there may be some truth to it, but there's still plenty of people out there with the grit and work ethic and tenacity for us to build a world-class team with highly motivated people.
916
I have not personally found that with my money.
917
Do you think reps are coin operators?
918
No.
919
No, I think it's always a mixture of incentives.
920
It's too binary to say, like, oh, they're either money-motivated or they're mission-motivated.
921
I think a lot of people are really excited about our mission because you get to help an SMB, a person that's like easy to feel good about helping.
922
But yeah, everybody in sales wants to earn money.
923
If I came to you and say, I didn't give a shit about the mission, just being honest, I care about making money and I'm going to crush quota and I'm going to be here night and day crushing quota.
924
Makes me nervous.
925
Does it?
926
Yeah.
927
Why?
928
They'll just go to the next thing where they get offered more money.
929
Is that not okay if I crush quota fee for two years?
930
I might not even get two years out of them if that's the case.
931
Especially because owner has so much brand equity now.
932
This happens all the time where founders see us and they go, I just need to seed my team with people from that organization.
933
Yeah, they're going to try to overpay, but if that individual believes in the mission and we're doing the other parts of that engagement methodology, so I have this methodology called cramps.
934
So there's like five things I want to do to make sure people are highly engaged and retained.
935
So community, so do people feel a sense of connection to the business and to the mission that we're supporting?
936
Recognition is huge.
937
I didn't invent any of this stuff.
938
Do they have a sense that they are empowered to go out and do their thing?
939
Do they have an internal locus of control?
940
Because there's this thing called the over-justification effect.
941
If you are glomming on to them constantly and getting people to do their job as a push, push, push, push, push, push, then you take away their internal locus of control and they actually will become less motivated.
942
So, I want to give them a sense of autonomy that they are in charge of their career and their business.
943
So, community, recognition, autonomy, mastery.
944
Mastery is: do they feel like they are on the path to mastering the craft of sales that is deeply motivating for people?
945
Do they have a sense of purpose?
946
That's all about mission.
947
So, that's like 20% of this methodology.
948
And then the S is steps.
949
So, do they have a steps is career progression?
950
Do they have a path to grow their career from BDR to AE to senior AE to manager?
951
And so, I'm very cognizant that we are equipping people to do that and then giving them the opportunities.
952
We promote a lot from within.
953
Even though I could go hire basically whoever I want now from this market, we promote heavily from within because I think that's such an important engagement driver.
954
You're scaling into a new phase of sales leadership for you.
955
What are you nervous about as you scale yourself as a sales leader?
956
That's a really good question.
957
I'm a podcaster.
958
A good one at that.
959
I go on dates, and girls are like, That's a really good question.
960
I'm like, I have had practice.
961
I had an old boss used to say, I pay it or be paranoid.
962
And I'm just sort of paranoid about everything.
963
I'm paranoid about everything breaking.
964
Our management team, am I scaling them fast enough to keep up with the pace of the business?
965
I'm sort of scared of it all.
966
And that is like a really positive motivation.
967
What did you do that you wish you hadn't done?
968
We haven't had as much success hiring senior reps, like reps with a whole bunch of experience.
969
We've actually had more success hiring people in like a two to four year experience range.
970
Jason Lemkin would say they know how hard it is and they don't want to go back again.
971
They're heads of sales or they've promoted up the hierarchy.
972
And actually, if you've done it once, you don't want to do it again.
973
True or not true?
974
I think it's more like we are highly, as you can tell by this podcast, I'm highly opinionated about how I want things done.
975
And we're going to give you a lot of coaching and a lot of feedback.
976
And we want you executing on our system.
977
Yeah, very systematized.
978
Like not much room if you want to bring a new flavor of sales, respectfully.
979
There's freedom within a framework.
980
I want people to have some creative freedom, but it's got to be within a methodology.
981
You know, when your wife says, Junior, of course you can go out with the boys.
982
It's your choice.
983
That's kind of the same thing.
984
Maybe.
985
Like, oh, I think I'll stay in it.
986
Yeah.
987
And so I think more senior reps come in and like, I know how to do this.
988
I'm good.
989
I'm going to do it my way.
990
That's worked for me for a whole bunch of time.
991
And oftentimes they can't outdo our system.
992
Even though they have more experience and a more developed skill set, them executing their skills, but within this other framework is less good than a newer rep that says, like, yeah, this sounds great.
993
I'll do it your way.
994
They tend to accelerate faster.
995
And that's not all the time.
996
Like two of our very best reps had a lot of restaurant tech experience beforehand.
997
But in general, I think like as we've gotten to this point in the company, people that are earlier innings of their career.
998
You're going to get coached every single week.
999
Every month, you get a monthly report card that talks about what you did well and where the areas of development.
1000
And then you develop your secret sauce.
1001
Like, what are we going to do for the next 30 days together to move the needle on whatever conversion rate?
1002
Some people just aren't about that anymore at this point of their career.
1003
And we had somebody opt out in like three or five weeks just because she was a really senior seller and clearly was like, nah, I'm not about this.
1004
So that's what you've done that you wish you hadn't done.
1005
What have you not done that you wish you had done?
1006
I wish I had been more insistent about hiring a head of applied AI.
1007
What?
1008
We're just hiring this role right now.
1009
I have become absolutely obsessed with all things AI.
1010
Like as soon as Chat GPT came out, I have like a clay table for my podcast prep that's connected to tally intake forms where the person fills it out and it updates the clay table and it runs these enrichments and creates questions for me and does all of this stuff.
1011
Like I have this everywhere in my life.
1012
You sound like a riot on a Friday night.
1013
I've actually reminded to reserve my calendar.
1014
Sorry, Jesus.
1015
I actually vibe coded an app on a Friday night a couple weeks ago, so you're not wrong.
1016
Stevie Case.
1017
So I had her on my podcast.
1018
She was talking about her initiative.
1019
I was like, I want this.
1020
Like, I need that for myself.
1021
And, you know, I mentioned the role and we're like, well, like, let's come back to that.
1022
And I should have, at that point, been like, no, no, no, like, let's get this role in today.
1023
And now I think we've just put up the JD online because I want somebody that is just like thinking and breathing all things AI.
1024
I would like to be farther ahead than we are with AI, even though people tell me that, like, we're so far ahead.
1025
Respectfully, why?
1026
Why do you need custom AI versus off-shelf AI application?
1027
Could be off-shelf.
1028
We're using a lot of off-shelf stuff, but somebody has to think about: okay, that entire ecosystem is this build or buy?
1029
And how is it all getting weaved together in a really cohesive manner?
1030
I'm pushing on our RevOps team to all get really conversant with GTM AI, and we're starting to get there, but I just want somebody dedicated to go absolutely all out on it.
1031
Wow.
1032
What do sales teams do today that there's no way they'll do in five years' time?
1033
Account research, lead prep, lead research, figuring out who to call.
1034
I think it's insane that companies do that today, that they have BDRs doing manual lead research.
1035
If you look at most BDR teams, like 30 to 50% of their time is just flushed down the toilet with work that a data ops team should be doing for them.
1036
Does outbound become less valuable in a world of infinite supply?
1037
What I mean by that is I can just bluntly send 10,000 emails in a minute with AI outbound email systems.
1038
And we've got AI SDR tools.
1039
I mean, I'm laughing with the team say because obviously I'm an investor for a living too.
1040
I think we've seen 15 AI SDRs in a week.
1041
That's just what we've seen in a week.
1042
You see these massive trends, and ultimately that advantage gets competed away.
1043
Same thing with sales engagement.
1044
When I was one of the first customers of SalesLoft Cadence, at that time, you could just have every BDR sending 100 emails a day.
1045
The BDR team that I inherited at Vision Critical 5X'd their per-person output after my like seventh month.
1046
And so we loaded up all of these lists and we were just blasting out fairly generic messaging straight from the old school predictable revenue playbook.
1047
God, Aaron Ross.
1048
Oh, yeah.
1049
Yeah.
1050
I mean, that takes me back.
1051
But that playbook was incredible when it first broke.
1052
And then everybody started doing it and then it stopped working.
1053
And so there's this Red Queens race where everybody has to move to the next thing and the next thing and the next thing.
1054
And yeah, I still think there's a tremendous advantage with some of this generative AI outbound.
1055
It will get competed away.
1056
And a tip for all sales leaders that I think they should do is leverage podcasts to acquire customers and speak to stakeholders.
1057
And so what I mean by that is: you know, we have an amazing company that sells to patent lawyers.
1058
Yeah.
1059
Interview the partners at the largest patent law firms and talk about their challenges, how they think about the future, da, da, da, da.
1060
Don't sell the company at all.
1061
And then after the show, they'll be like, so what will owner do?
1062
And you're like, oh, sure, let me tell you for five minutes.
1063
You do one a week, you've got 52 leads a year.
1064
I met a guy who generates 60-something percent of his company's funnel this way.
1065
They have five podcasts, this company.
1066
And all they do is interview the biggest names in their industry.
1067
And that person almost always introduces them to the person they actually want to talk to.
1068
And then that person posts the episode on their podcast.
1069
I'm on Owner's the Manual podcast, and I'm so excited.
1070
And then all of the competitors are like, oh my God, what the fuck is that?
1071
It's a great strategy.
1072
But it's so underutilized.
1073
And it's actually underutilized because the cost of entry is still quite high versus posting on LinkedIn.
1074
You have to get Riverside, you have to get a microphone.
1075
But even that is nothing investment.
1076
What's a podcast?
1077
Mike, 200 and something bucks.
1078
I have no idea.
1079
But not much.
1080
No, I completely agree with you.
1081
My entire home studio setup was like two grand.
1082
I completely agree with you, but people are lazy.
1083
They are.
1084
And it's still much harder than posting on LinkedIn.
1085
Yeah, you're not wrong.
1086
And my favorite thing about Secrets is you tell the world and people still don't listen.
1087
Do you know what I mean?
1088
People ask me this all the time.
1089
They're like, aren't you afraid you're like giving away all of this stuff that your company's doing?
1090
And I tell them, it's like, one, I don't think anybody's really going to do it that well.
1091
This was something from Stevie.
1092
Like, execution is the only moat.
1093
And I'll always execute, out, execute these folks.
1094
Yeah.
1095
I'm 100% confident in that.
1096
And the other piece is like, if you're a direct competitor of mine and you start using my tactics, I'm in your head.
1097
You know now that I'm better than you are.
1098
And you'll have to carry that with you, always knowing that you're one step behind and you're just trying to copy me.
1099
My mother, actually, I walk with her every weekend at a marathon.
1100
And she always says, What the fuck?
1101
Like, why are you telling everyone to do this and to do what you do?
1102
And I'm like, because I'm telling them that I'm making spaghetti bolognese.
1103
They use analogies for her.
1104
And she's like, right.
1105
And I'm like, yeah, but there's two different types of people.
1106
One goes to Trader Joe's and buys the bolognese mix and the pasta.
1107
The other makes the fresh pasta with the whole wheat that they got from the farmer's market.
1108
They do it the night before so it can aerate in the fridge.
1109
They then go to the farmer's market for the tomatoes.
1110
It's the how you do what you do.
1111
You could tell me to do the podcast like you do.
1112
It's how you do what you do.
1113
And again, this comes back to first principles reasoning.
1114
You know, people are going to hear what we do and they can try to slap that onto their business, but what we do only works because of this entire ecosystem of what we do.
1115
Like we run a highly structured system and we invest in a certain way.
1116
Like you need to follow my playbook.
1117
You need to do all of the things.
1118
You can't just be like, oh, we're going to do AI lead enrichment.
1119
We'll just drop that in unless you have the enablement and adoption from the BDR team so that they're not just like doing their own stuff on the side.
1120
Execution is the whole piece.
1121
Do you think it's valuable to have competitors in your head?
1122
Like, do you like to inspire teams with like, hey, we're beating X competitor?
1123
We don't that much.
1124
Yeah, we'll joke around about it, but it's not really like our driving motivation.
1125
It is the mission.
1126
Like it's easy to feel good about helping a restaurant down the street just survive and get by.
1127
And a lot of the motivation for the team is sharing these success stories.
1128
Like you see your customer in one of the channels that's grown like 3x and they're making like six grand more a month, which, you know, doesn't seem like a lot of money.
1129
But if you're a restaurant owner and your take-home is like you're working 100 hours a week and net net, net net, you're only making 80 grand.
1130
And now there's an extra 40 grand in your pocket because we've helped you grow online, which is highly profitable.
1131
It's easy to be really excited about that.
1132
We do pay attention to some competitors, but we're.
1133
Which competitor do you most respect?
1134
I have a lot of respect for toast.
1135
Good product craft.
1136
Their GTM execution is really good.
1137
They operate in a pretty like respectful way too.
1138
Like we don't.
1139
I think the competitors that I have complete disregard and disrespect for the ones that treat their customers poorly, these are SMVs and you're like trapping them into a contract.
1140
You're holding their domain hostage so they can't move over.
1141
You're lying to them about all of this stuff and trying to fear-monger as they're trying to leave your company.
1142
That's really inexcusable, especially when I say mom and pop shops who are vulnerable and don't have the power.
1143
That makes me mad.
1144
I know that in the long run, we will win because of that.
1145
You know, in the short term, I'm sure it's helped them hold on to some deals and stem some churn here and there, but none of those customers feel good about that relationship.
1146
And again, I think one of the smart things that we do at Owner, and certainly a lesson I took from Toby, is like Toby always talks about we're building a hundred-year company.
1147
And one of the things that at Owner we've done is like optimize for the long term.
1148
Like, why don't we lock customers into year-long contracts?
1149
We probably could.
1150
Well, we want to earn your business every single month.
1151
Does that lead to some short-term churn?
1152
Yeah.
1153
Does it put tremendous pressure on us on product and execution to deliver an amazing customer outcome?
1154
Yeah.
1155
And I think long-term, that compounds and becomes a durable advantage.
1156
Like, we part ways really nicely with people.
1157
If you want to leave owner, we'll actually help you move on to your next thing.
1158
You want to revert your website.
1159
You need us to give you DNS records and stuff.
1160
We actually do more than we really need to make it easy for somebody to transition because I think that brand in the market compounds over time and is clearly something that builds steam for us.
1161
Dude, I want to move into a quick font.
1162
I can talk to you all day.
1163
You are advising a 23-year-old.
1164
I'm your little brother.
1165
Okay.
1166
What do you advise me, knowing all that you know now, entering this workforce?
1167
Focus on the inputs and not the outputs.
1168
Focus on your work ethic, your rate of learning, your coachability.
1169
Learn consistency every day, daily discipline, and know that the outcomes will eventually come.
1170
Got it.
1171
Love it.
1172
Reflect back on your time with owner.
1173
You can relive one of the days.
1174
Which day do you choose to relive and why?
1175
That's a really good question.
1176
We had a pretty good one recently.
1177
On Wednesday, the end of April, we had to have a big surge to hit the number.
1178
And I was in the office in Toronto.
1179
There was a bunch of reps in the San Francisco office.
1180
They're all remote, but we had them go in to basically just do this end-of-month surge, bring the vibes.
1181
I was in the office till like one in the morning with just like one rep left over.
1182
And we closed the last deal at like 12:15 a.m.
1183
Toronto time.
1184
And the West Coast reps closed deals even later than that.
1185
It was just a really cool moment because we knew it was an important month for the company.
1186
And even at 10:30, there was BDR still making calls to the West Coast to try to get like last demos done.
1187
We were closing the very last deals.
1188
I just had a blast.
1189
We were collectively pushing for this number, even though almost every one of those reps was already at their number.
1190
They didn't really have to do it for themselves.
1191
And I think that is a special part of owners' DNA.
1192
Yeah, we have people that are very individually motivated, but this like collective is pretty special.
1193
What have you changed your mind on most in the last 12 months?
1194
I think ChatGPT and OpenAI are unwaveringly the dominant leader for the next 10 years.
1195
And I think they'll be a $2 trillion company.
1196
Question.
1197
I wrote about this a bit on my newsletter.
1198
There was such a stark difference to the capabilities of O3 compared to everything before it.
1199
I mentioned how I wanted to hire this head of applied AI earlier.
1200
I started playing around with O3 and I updated a bunch of my like ChatGPT workflows to use O3 and I was just like, holy crap, this is so different.
1201
The memory, the reasoning, like the speed and being able to do research and also deeply reason, it made me think that this roadmap is moving even faster than I anticipated.
1202
You can take Jason's side or Rory's side on who is right.
1203
Is AI going to bring mass unemployment in a way that we haven't seen before?
1204
I don't think so because of Jevins' paradox.
1205
You saw this argument as compute got cheap, well, are all these foundation models going to be less valuable?
1206
It's like, no, it's cheaper now.
1207
Everybody's using way more compute.
1208
And so if the effectiveness of every salesperson and the effectiveness of all these individual contributors goes way up, are we going to want way, way more of those?
1209
I think yes.
1210
And I think AI is going to drive so much more company creation that there will be a consistent demand for these roles because the economics of the roles get better.
1211
There's more companies that need sales reps.
1212
I mean, I cannot read the future on this topic, but Jevin's paradox may lead to high employment.
1213
How do you motivate sales teams when numbers are missed?
1214
It's about the actions you take before you miss the number.
1215
I think if you tie your identity to whether or not you hit the number, then when you miss the number, it's.
1216
But a thing that we talk a lot about at Owner is about the inputs and the daily grind, and it's about the journey.
1217
A thing that I get quoted for saying is: sales is a personal development exercise, disguised as a career.
1218
Sales being hard is a feature, not a bug of this job.
1219
Failure is a feature, not a bug of this job.
1220
And so, if you can get people into this more stoic mindset that, like, the challenges are the journey, and failure is the journey.
1221
That's that's what helps us get better as people, that's what helps us grow and develop ourselves.
1222
Then, when you inevitably have these down periods, you're prepared for them mentally.
1223
Like, we vaccinated people against those difficult times.
1224
Tell me, owner, 2035, 10 years out, where is owner then?
1225
I think we'll be a generational public company.
1226
The only reason I left Shopify, because I loved my setup there.
1227
I still love Shopify.
1228
I think it's an amazing company.
1229
I think Toby is one of the greats.
1230
There was nothing making me want to leave shop.
1231
The only reason I joined owner is I think Adam has the chance to be a generational CEO.
1232
I think he's got all of all of the DNA.
1233
This is a massive market, and this is a chance for me to hit a grand slam.
1234
It seems really arrogant, but like, I want to be one of the handful of people that have taken a company from early to IPO.
1235
You need an incredible team and market and all this stuff to be able to make that happen.
1236
And I thought owner was that bet, and I actually feel more bullish today on that than I did three years ago.
1237
Dude, I have loved this.
1238
I'm so appreciate you sending over your thoughts.
1239
We obviously have our research.
1240
I'm very glad that I bluntly freestyle most of the time.
1241
This was like a career bucketless thing for me.
1242
You know, I've been a fan and a listener of yours forever.
1243
So this was a blast.
1244
I mean, that was such a special show to do.
1245
It makes such a difference being in person.
1246
We have so many incredible founders reach out and post shows like this and say how they change their organizations because of shows like this.
1247
Let me know what you think.
