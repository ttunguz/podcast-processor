1
The first one is folding shares, about 20 LPs to start in our little conference area with our flat panel TV on the wall.
2
It's grown to be a somewhat larger production.
3
It's like a process of falling up the stairs.
4
Just when you think you've got it figured out, some weird issue pops up and you've got some new thing to prove.
5
Every one of these companies that end up being a global world leader always has one of these stories of the path not taken.
6
Today's conversation is with Mark Andreessen, one of the rare people who's helped shape both the internet's past and its future.
7
We reflect on the firm's earliest days from folding chairs and a flat screen in a small office in 2010 to what's now a multi-stage, multi-sector platform backing the next wave of generational companies.
8
Mark shares what it was like raising Fund 1 in the shadow of the 2008 financial crisis, why scale became a strategic asset and venture, and how software is eating the world evolves into a much broader and deeper investment thesis.
9
We also talk about the shift from generalist investors to vertical experts and how A16Z's little tech agenda is reframing policy conversations around innovation, AI, and American dynamism.
10
Let's get into it.

14
So the firm was started, we raised the first fund in 2009, which was in the depths of the stock market crash after the height of the financial crisis of 2008.
15
So we had the first LP meeting in 2010.
16
So this is when we're 15 or 16.
17
Wow.
18
Yeah, the first one is folding chairs, about 20 LPs to start.
19
Wow.
20
Folding chairs in our office in our little conference area with our flat panel TP on the wall.
21
And actually, some of the same people are.
22
They must have been true believers at the time, not just because of the strategy, but because of market timing.
23
Take us a little bit back what that was like.
24
So the thing to remember is the dot-com boom bubble was sort of 95 to 2000, although it has its own ups and downs even during that period that got forgotten later.
25
But in 2000, of course, catastrophic crash.
26
And then it took three or four years to dig out of the dot-com crash.
27
And so it was like 2003, 2004 before anything really started to happen.
28
And then immediately what happened was any sign of anything working in tech was immediately viewed by just screams in the past.
29
It was just Bubble 2.0, Bubble 2.0 was just like, it's all happening again.
30
These crazy idiots are back at it again.
31
Everything's going to come crashing down.
32
There were two big M<unk>A events in 2005.
33
Yahoo bought Flickr and Delicious.
34
So did Yahoo buy them both ink or something?
35
And they were like $25 million tickets each.
36
And literally the press just like bananas.
37
Facebook was getting started.
38
Social media is a joke.
39
What did your cat have for breakfast?
40
Nobody cares.
41
Right.
42
How are they going to make money?
43
Are they going to make money?
44
They'll never make money.
45
And so it was just this like wall of negativity heading into 2008.
46
And then the financial crisis happens.
47
And just like everything just gets like completely devastated.
48
Everybody's flat on their back in the financial investment world.
49
And so Ben and I, in March of 2009, decided it's the perfect time to go start a venture capital firm, which was an absolutely unique view at the time.
50
There were only two venture capital funds raised in all of 2009.
51
It was us and a new Coastal Ventures Fund.
52
And Vinod, of course, was one of the legends of venture capital.
53
So he was able to do that.
54
But we were the only other, literally, venture fund raised that year.
55
And at one point, were you considering starting another company together?
56
Or were you like, hey, we really want to support entrepreneurs?
57
This is the company.
58
Yeah, we were done.
59
We had started multiple companies.
60
And so we were done.
61
We had completed that part of life's journey.
62
And so then we decided to start a firm.
63
We met some people who were really nice to us and really helped us kind of get underway.
64
And then we started meeting the LPs.
65
We'll get to the evolution of the firm, but just because you mentioned it, the Zuckerberg acquisition story, you, of course, have been in the board and Facebook for a long time.
66
Take us back to that memory and your conversations with Mark, and what was your perspective at the time?
67
Yeah, I mean, this has been chronicled over the years, but basically what happened was it wasn't negativity at that time of like this technology is evil and it's going to destroy the world.
68
The negativity was this technology is absolutely useless, absolutely useless, has no point, has no purpose.
69
It's a joke.
70
It's a farce, basically.
71
And like, as you said, never make any money.
72
And that was just kind of the uniform public conversation around it at the time.
73
And so Facebook took off it.
74
They had ad revenue early on, but early on, it was like remnant ad revenue.
75
They didn't have targeted ads yet.
76
So early ad revenue, Facebook literally was selling remnant banner ads from the Bing ad Network.
77
And so it was like the super low CPMs.
78
And, you know, Mark always had this theory of how he could turn it into a big thing, but he just said this wall of negativity.
79
And then he just at that time had a lot of people around him.
80
I mean, it had been a fast rush from 2004 to 2008 to get to the point where all of a sudden they're starting to get offers in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
81
And was this after a down round or before the downround?
82
The Microsoft downround was after that.
83
Because that was after the $15 billion round.
84
It was like a downright.
85
So that was a couple years later.
86
But I remember Yahoo at the time, Yahoo was doing a turnaround under Terry Semmel at the time.
87
And Terry correctly figured out that Facebook was a property that they should buy.
88
And so they actually struck a deal.
89
I don't know if it got literally signed or verbally agreed to, but they structured a deal.
90
It was a billion-dollar takeout.
91
It was an agreement to do a billion-dollar takeout.
92
And then the financial crisis hit.
93
Advertising immediately collapsed because advertising is the first thing that gets cut during a recession.
94
And Yahoo came back and essentially renegotiated the deal, tried to lower the price.
95
And that gave Mark basically the, I don't know, cover kind of wherewithal to be able to walk away from the deal.
96
Wow.
97
But look, at the very least, strongly considering it at the billion dollar level.
98
And again, it's just like at the time, it was just like a spectacular home run for a company growing that fast.
99
Started in a dorm four years earlier during a time when, again, this stuff was all just viewed as a complete joke.
100
The sort of ultimate kind of thing in the story is a few years later, somehow, I don't know how, but somehow the internalysis of Facebook at that time.
101
And Yahoo people were bullish on the company, which is why they offered to buy it.
102
But they and everybody else radically underestimated the future growth of the company.
103
Like, it's just like this incredible low-bound kind of estimate.
104
And then, not only did Facebook grow really fast, but they figured out targeted advertising.
105
And then, by the way, they went through the exact same crisis again, basically, after they went public in 2012.
106
They went public right as the transition from desktop to mobile was happening.
107
It was really when the iPhone was getting critical, man.
108
Fascinating.
109
And there was just this wall again in the press, this wall of negativity, which is, I mean, you read the articles at the time, and they're just like, this is going to destroy Facebook because everybody knows that internet ads are based on the amount of screen real estate that you can sell.
110
Like, ad rates literally are the number of pixels on the screen.
111
And therefore, logically, because mobile screens are much smaller than desktop screens, the ad rates are going to shrink, and that's going to be it.
112
And the stock came out and shipped the vet right out of the gate.
113
And it was literally this argument: the mobile ad opportunity was much less than the desktop ad opportunity.
114
And what we know now today, right, is that mobile meant people were going to use this stuff far more all day long.
115
Usage went way up, and then we learned that the targeting works, right?
116
And everybody knows today is sort of obvious that a company like Facebook is a trove of personal data that you can target ads against.
117
But at the time, it was not something that people believe to be the case.
118
I often describe these companies, even the ones that kind of from the outside look like they're just up and to the right the whole time.
119
I always describe it as it's like a process of falling off the stairs.
120
Because it's just when you think you've got everything figured out, like some weird issue basically pops up and you've got some new thing to prove, and you've got some other thing.
121
And Mark's one of the best who's ever lived at being able to work his way through every single thing that's come along.
122
It's funny that we went from mobile ads won't work to organizations, you know, Tristan Harris dedicated to stopping ads from working too well, basically.
123
It works so well.
124
We have an epidemic of sort of people using it so much.
125
And you know, this is a political ad specifically.
126
And they can literally like put the whammy on people to vote for candidates who nobody would ever vote for had they not been mind-controlled by the Facebook algorithm.
127
And the whole thing the whole time was so weird because it's like, wow, like if the mind control works so well, like why don't we have triple the ad rates on social toothpaste?
128
Why does it only work for Trump?
129
Yeah, exactly.
130
A few hundred thousand dollars can ship the whole entire election.
131
Yeah, right, exactly.
132
That's the thing.
133
The Russians can spend.
134
By the way, I think the result of it was, I think it was a result of $80,000 of ad spend on the Russians in the relevant period of the election.
135
It was like a total of like $140,000, but during the actual ran up the election, it was $80,000.
136
And so the theory was $80,000 of ads channeled into this magic mind control device.
137
By bank of the buck.
138
Yeah, that literally swung an election that Hillary Clinton spent $3 billion on.
139
Right?
140
And the whole time we're just sitting there, I'm just sitting there just like, I can't even believe.
141
Like, it doesn't make any sense.
142
I went to Hillary's first big speech after she lost at Stanford, and she literally said on stage, Donald Trump is only president today because Vladimir Putin hacked Facebook.
143
And I'm like, Vladimir Putin didn't act Facebook.
144
What the F are you talking about?
145
Anyway, and so literally it went from 2008 to this is useless to 2012.
146
This is still useless.
147
However, it does get some credit for the Arab Spring, right?
148
And for getting Obama elected.
149
And there were lots of headlines at that time on social media saves democracy because of the Arab Spring.
150
And then to 2016, it's the evil mind-controlling death machine.
151
It turned out that the method that was supposedly used by the Russians/slash the Trump campaign to do the mind control, you know, basically like that method.
152
I mean, we now know basically it never worked.
153
Like the whole psychometric thing that they were doing, that Cambridge Analytica was supposedly doing.
154
It's not something people do today.
155
Like, this is the other part of the narrative you're told to believe is it was magic mind control, but only for that election, and then nobody ever tried it again.
156
Yeah, exactly.
157
Yeah.
158
It's fascinating to imagine sort of.
159
Maybe Snap should have sold to Facebook.
160
Maybe it would have been better for everyone else.
161
It's just fascinating to explore sort of tech alternatives.
162
In my view, it's so hard to redo the counterfactuals because this is like the classic debate of sort of historians, which is like how much has history guided these big impersonal trends, you know, these big kind of impersonal forces, these tides or waves that swamp everything versus how much is based on sort of individual action.
163
And I just think these things are so contingent.
164
I have endless stories like Netscape.
165
We almost bought Yahoo.
166
There was like a bid ass spread between $3 million and $5 million.
167
Oh my God.
168
Yahoo almost bought Google, and there was a very low-priced deal at the time.
169
Netflix almost sold to Blockbuster early on.
170
Every one of these companies that ended up being a global world beater always has one of these stories of the path not taken.
171
And so Uber and Lyft almost merged at one point.
172
Yeah, exactly.
173
And so, my view, just having been through it, I mean, look, the forces mean something.
174
Like, the smartphone was going to happen.
175
There were going to be killer apps on the phone.
176
There was going to be something like this.
177
Somebody was going to do it.
178
And like, had, I don't know, in the counterfactual, Facebook sold Yahoo and Yahoo let it languish.
179
Somebody else probably would have figured it out.
180
But in a sense, some of these things were bound to happen.
181
But the specific companies involved is just that there are so many kind of twists and turns.
182
Yeah.
183
It's so contingent on very specific people doing very specific things at each point.
184
Totally.
185
That I think it's just extremely sensitive to the micro-level decisions that are made along the way.
186
Yeah, speaking of twists and turns, let's go back to the firm.
187
The first fund is 300 million, correct?
188
And you didn't have a sense for how big it would become, but you wrote Software's The End of the World.
189
You had a sort of hypothesis that these companies were going to get bigger, there's going to be more of them.
190
Take us through when you realized that scale was going to be a strategic asset for venture and that the future of venture was going to look like this barbell.
191
Yeah, so I actually remember a conversation with John Dorr in the mid-90s because KP was an investor in Netscape at the time.
192
You know, when I was young, basically the model was very straightforward at the time, which was basically.
193
It was mostly you just raised like a venture A round, which would be like a three or four or five million dollar round, maybe six or seven if you were super ambitious.
194
And then there'd be like a B round of 20 or 30.
195
And then there was what was called the mezzanine round, which was the C round.
196
And that basically is the pre-IPO round.
197
And so you kind of raise a total of three rounds and maybe $30 or $40 million.
198
And then you go public.
199
And then if you needed money, you would go public.
200
Basically, there were no follow-on rounds after the C round.
201
And so you would go public.
202
And you could go public in those days at like, it was sort of 50 million in revenue and then a 10x revenue multiple meant a $500 million market cap was the bar to go public.
203
By the way, as an example, Amazon went public in 97, and I think it was $400 million valuation.
204
So right in line with that model, and that's a similar in 95.
205
And so venture had this very specific role.
206
But what was becoming clear even in the 90s that actually, I think it was a conversation John and I had about Cisco originally, which is just like some of these companies are really going to rip.
207
They're really going to run.
208
At the time, it was like they're going to run to $100 billion, which at the time was like the big ceiling.
209
And it's just like, all right, like all of a sudden the venture B round looks great.
210
All of a sudden, by the way, the mezzanine round looks great.
211
Like maybe the VCs should basically just keep re-upping.
212
Is it a mistake?
213
If you can make as much absolute money investing $50 million in Cisco at their Series C as you could five in their Series A, like in those days, it was like a big statement to say maybe the venture firms should do that.
214
And then, of course, what's become clear since then is the ceiling isn't $100 billion.
215
It's much larger than that.
216
It's much, much higher than that.
217
And that's just a consequence of tech proliferating and becoming more important.
218
So anyway, so we had that sense, and some of that had started, and Facebook actually was raising larger rounds by that point.
219
DST kind of redefines growth investing when they did the Facebook round.
220
So basically, this idea of sort of venture growth investing was starting to really materialize.
221
And so we did define the firm right up front.
222
We said we want to be stage agnostic.
223
We want to be seed venture and growth.
224
That was in the original pitch deck.
225
It wasn't enough money to do a lot of growth investing, but we could start to get underway.
226
Basically, this is our.
227
If you're going to get into one of these world-beating companies, you can still do it at the B, C, or D, and you'll still have venture-scale returns.
228
And so, yeah, we defined that right up front.
229
And when did we figure out, because our approach to sort of specialized funds is different than some of these other partnerships that, hey, we're just all generalists.
230
We're a small team.
231
We all do everything.
232
When did that model originate?
233
What was that journey like?
234
Yeah, so we started that way.
235
So we started as generalists.
236
And Ben and I had both worked in both consumer and enterprise, which are kind of the two big categories.
237
At the time, it was basically consumer software VC, enterprise software VC, and then sort of biohealth tech.
238
The older venture firms actually did both what they call digital or IT investing, software investing, and then they also did biotech.
239
And actually, a lot of those firms, they got like internal divorces and spun their groups off because those industries at the time were going in different directions.
240
But Ben and I had done consumer and enterprise.
241
And so we just said, look, we'll just be a generalist firm sort of modeled after the benchmark model.
242
And a big part of this is just industry evolution, which is around the time we started the firm.
243
It was also the time that I would say the tech industry fundamentally changed from primarily building tools to actually going like directly in the industry.
244
So we call it cold stack companies.
245
And so I think the reason the generalist model worked well for as long as it did is because fundamentally a database company, a router company, a word processor company, an operating systems company, they're all fundamentally tools.
246
And so they're different if they sell to consumer enterprise, but a router is a piece of software in a box.
247
Chips are a little different, but a database and an operating system are similar.
248
The technical challenges, the form of the company, the organizational model for the company is similar.
249
Word processors and video games at the time both cost $50, both sold in a box on retail store shelves, kind of similar.
250
And so the generalist model, I think, worked really well when the industry was at earlier model.
251
And then 2009, 2010 was a pivot we now know, which was the rise of Uber and Lyft, the rise of Airbnb, the rise of Tesla, the rise of SpaceX, the world-beating companies of the 2020s.
252
And then we therefore started investing in everything from these e-commerce marketplaces to these new kinds of defense companies.
253
And then we decided to take on biotech because we thought biotech is becoming much more based on software and IT and data and AI.
254
And then basically what we realized is: okay, the generalist model doesn't work anymore because each of those things now is actually a very deep domain in and of itself, right, with like very specific domain knowledge.
255
And then the specific problem that a generalist has is that a generalist can sense heat, but a generalist has a very hard time getting into the specifics.
256
And the reason the specifics really matter is because so much adventure, because the way venture works is if you invest in one company in a space, you can't invest in the other.
257
So if you pick the space correctly and invest in the wrong company, you're screwed, right?
258
Because you can't fix your mistake.
259
You can't then invest in the successful company because of the conflict issue.
260
And so what we realized was the thing that was becoming very important in this new world was understanding deep in the vertical what was going on, specifically for the purpose of being able to tell which company was actually the one that was most likely to win.
261
And that's just really hard to do if you don't have domain knowledge.
262
And so that catalyzed us to verticalize.
263
And then we did that in two steps.
264
We did a partial verticalization early, probably, I don't know, 2013 or something.
265
And then by 2017, I think we did the full one we have now.
266
It's fascinating because 15, 20 years ago, things like Y Combinator were getting off the ground, and you were this yourself.
267
People said there was an arbitrage around young technical founders and this idea that you could teach them the business elements and they could be successful.
268
You don't need to go to NBA to be a successful founder.
269
That's accurate.
270
And yet today, maybe there's a similar arbitrage around domain experts, where the tech has gotten easier and it's easier to get sort of things off the ground and domain expertise values more and distribution is valued more maybe than it was 15 years ago.
271
And maybe that's true on the founder side and on the investor side.
272
Yeah, although at least until now, I think the question is whether AI is going to change this, but at least until now, it still was the case that the founders also needed to be very deep in the tech.
273
And even the founders that would go out, and there was this wave of like design founders, right?
274
And it's like, okay, that's great.
275
The design founders are great.
276
And it turns out the successful design founders are also very strong technologists.
277
And they maybe pretended sometimes that they weren't because they wanted the design credit.
278
But it turned out they were actually very deep and substantive and interested.
279
Yeah.
280
These are Ben Silberman and Brian Chester.
281
These guys are like top-end technical founders in addition to being great designers.
282
And so, yeah, like I would argue, there's really no escape from deep domain knowledge.
283
To your point, I think the question is: okay, if AI makes deep domain knowledge instantly accessible to anybody, you know, if you have O3 deep researcher, it's equivalent at your fingertips.
284
And if you're a generalist or a person wearing many hats, can AI give you the depth when you need it?
285
And I don't know.
286
I'm excited to see people try that.
287
It's a little bit like the debate happening around coding right now, which is, okay, is vibe coding a substitute for like actual coding, right?
288
And sitting here today, like vibe coding is like super exciting for casual development, but at least right now, all of the really sharp technologists I know don't think that you could vibe code a top-end software company today.
289
But like the coding capabilities of these models are getting really good.
290
And so the agents are starting to work.
291
And so, you know, this sort of famous Dilbert, which is Dilbert's boss pitches Dilbert on they're going to go start a company together.
292
And the boss is like, I'm going to bring the idea and be the manager and you're going to do the coding.
293
And Dilbert's like, and so what you're saying is you're going to contribute nothing.
294
Right.
295
And so does the existence of like really steady-earned AI coding actually change that?
296
To Dilbert's boss all of a sudden can have the AI write the code.
297
Yeah.
298
And then you get these very entertaining thought experiments.
299
Are agents going to get really good at writing code?
300
And then are you going to be able to have a non-technical person supervising a thousand AI coders?
301
Yeah.
302
Right.
303
And outracing a top-end technical person who's supervising 100 great coders.
304
It's possible.
305
We'll see.
306
It's the era of the ideas guy.
307
Yeah.
308
Yeah.
309
I want to talk about areas where we've chosen to play and areas where we haven't chosen to play.
310
So this.
311
firm, American Dynamism, Europe, when it's not shooting itself in the foot, regulation-wise, they're increasing their defense spend.
312
Could you imagine Europe dynamism?
313
How have we thought about it?
314
And I know there's big things on the horizon which we can't exactly get into right now, but how have we thought about it internationally, historically, and how do you think about it going forward?
315
The good news is, look, the world is globalizing.
316
There's incredible activity and interest all over the world.
317
Like everywhere we go, people want to talk about tech.
318
They want to learn about tech.
319
Ben saw this more than me, but like when Ben wrote his book and went on tour, it didn't matter what country he went to, thousands of kids show up and they want to learn how to do this.
320
And look, the internet had a big impact there, which is every kid anywhere in the world now can watch computer teal talks and our podcast and everything else.
321
And so I would say global knowledge is way up, global enthusiasm is way up, relevance to societies is way up.
322
As you mentioned, like defense, Europe needs to rearm.
323
Presumably, they'd be better off rearming with the new systems as opposed to the old systems.
324
Drone swarms instead of aircraft carriers, right?
325
That kind of thing.
326
We'll see.
327
And then just the reality, there's just smart people all over the place.
328
And so there's human capital everywhere.
329
I think historians will look back and they'll just say, wow, the 21st century was a really primitive society.
330
They had all these smart people all over the world and they never figured out how to actually utilize them.
331
They never figured out how to identify them and use them.
332
And so the startup process is a way to especially get smart young people to do ambitious things.
333
So that's great.
334
It's all fantastic.
335
Against that, it's just this incredible drag by bad governments and bad policies.
336
As you mentioned, Europe persists in shooting itself not just in the foot, but in the other foot and in the ankle and in the knee and in the gut.
337
And they're just on this absolute frenzy to regulate and kill tech in Europe, the UK.
338
And they're proud of it.
339
They're proud of it.
340
Like, they're very proud of it.
341
Yes.
342
The actual European line now is, we quote, this is in the FTS, this is an actual quote from a European, a senior politician.
343
It's we know we cannot be the global leader in tech innovation, so therefore we will be the global leader in tech regulation.
344
Embassy and apply for a visa as fast as possible, right?
345
And in fact, that's what's happened.
346
As a consequence, a lot of these really curious, bright people basically end up moving to the U.S.
347
And so we've been an enormous beneficiary as a country and as a firm of that.
348
And so that remains a really big challenge.
349
It's interesting watching the UK right now because I thought under the previous government they were going to become enlightened and bring in.
350
And they did the opposite.
351
Like they tried to ban AI and they said they were going to liberalize crypto.
352
They never did.
353
But the new government, they say they're going to open up some of this stuff.
354
They still want to keep all the regulations, but they say they want economic growth.
355
So we'll see.
356
The defense stuff, yeah.
357
I mean, there's already a dispute.
358
This is just in the headlines.
359
There's already a dispute if Europe cranks their defense spending up to 5% of GDP, which they're supposed to.
360
Will they buy any of that from the U.S.?
361
Well, it only be purchased from indigenous European defense vendors.
362
So it's already becoming part of the whole trade war.
363
I mean, look, I think most of the state of the world is very, at least for what we do, it's high-caliber people being held back by being in bad systems.
364
Yeah.
365
And what is our criteria for opening up offices in other places more generally?
366
Yeah, so basically, there's two kinds of activities that make sense for a firm like us to do internationally, I think.
367
Maybe three.
368
One is just sales, the crude term.
369
We dress it up with fancy words.
370
Business development.
371
Yeah.
372
Go to market.
373
A lot of the market is global for all of our companies.
374
And so helping our companies succeed and build up businesses globally.
375
And we've been doing that from the beginning.
376
And that's always an important thing.
377
Two is investing.
378
And look, we've invested.
379
We've always been, and I would say, other than China, generally, we've been open investing in many places in the world.
380
And we have investments in a lot of places.
381
Very recently in Mistral and France.
382
Yeah, exactly.
383
But we've made investments in the past in Vietnam and lots of other interesting places.
384
We'll go where the flow is.
385
You know, having said that, again, just because of this kind of political dynamic, it's just been striking over the last 30 years how many great founders who could have stayed in country X and started a company there have just moved to the U.S.
386
instead.
387
Yeah.
388
And so we just from a practical standpoint, have tended to emphasize U.S.
389
investing because we figure we'll get most of the best of the global founders anyway.
390
And then maybe the third thing, we're not really active on this right now, but we're very active now in U.S.
391
policy.
392
But, you know, there are these policy issues all over the world.
393
Do we need to go get more, insert ourselves more into God help us, European politics?
394
Or whatever.
395
And then the question, you know, can we?
396
Because Americans, are we allowed to?
397
Yeah.
398
Well, I know we've only done this sort of kicking and screaming.
399
This is not our intent even on the U.S.
400
side.
401
But talk a little bit about how just the little tech concept, as it's sort of different from big tech, sort of emerged in our thinking.
402
Yeah, so basically, this also goes right back to this thing of the tech industry kind of changing around 2010.
403
So in the era between, call it 1950 to 2010, when the industry was in what is called tool phase, chips and word processors and routers and spreadsheets and things like that, startup tech particularly was never really a salient political topic.
404
Really, the only time I'd ever entered politics really was with antitrust.
405
And so it was like a really big deal in the 90s when the government dug into Microsoft, because that case was a big deal, but also because it was a very rare case of the government actually caring about tech and wanting to become involved.
406
And so there was sort of a state of sort of, I would say, I don't know, benign neglect or something up until 2010.
407
And by the way, in both directions, like the Valley companies never thought it was important to go to DC.
408
The DC companies didn't really think the Valley companies mattered.
409
And then, yeah, that all started changing in around, I don't know, probably 2012, 2013.
410
You had this sort of increasing political, I would call, I don't know, energizing happening just, you know, in general.
411
And you started getting this anti-tech narrative, started getting more political, got wrapped up in the Occupy Wall Street 1% thing.
412
And are these tech people just as bad as the finance people?
413
The FT just ran a big story saying the tech people are now definitively worse than the finance people.
414
And I read this story twice and I still don't understand it.
415
But the gist of it was something like, at least the finance people you can have dinner with and it's fun.
416
Whereas the tech people are just like all.
417
Sometimes they say, at least the finance people know that they're money motivated or something, whereas the tech people have the delusion that it's.
418
Yeah, they're saying sanctimonious and insufferable, which, you know.
419
It was really Trump.
420
It was really Trump's nomination and election that really radicalized a pretty big block of political actors in the country against tech.
421
And then, by the way, the way I've described the last decade is the left got like super angry at tech because of Trump and because of inequality and all these other things.
422
And then the right got super mad at tech because the right thought that tech was all on the left.
423
Yeah.
424
Right.
425
And so we'd go talk to Republicans and they would basically say, yeah, we agree with you, but like you're all Democrats.
426
And so, you know, F off.
427
Yeah.
428
They thought it was very entertaining.
429
Social media was the tip of the spear of that for about five years.
430
And then in the last five years, crypto became incredibly politicized.
431
And the U.S.
432
government basically launched a full-on war against it, tried to kill it.
433
And then AI got just like incredibly politicized, starting basically around 2021, 2022.
434
And the government was moving in very hard on AI.
435
And for us, it was the combination of crypto and AI that got us extremely alarmed.
436
And so we decided we had to become involved.
437
But like I said, there are specific point issues in both of those domains, but there's just this general kind of thing, which is like, all right, we always wanted to build things that matter.
438
It turns out these things matter.
439
And as a consequence, we're either going to show up and explain ourselves or other people who hate us are going to describe us.
440
And so what we've done is we've generalized that idea out into what we call the little tech agenda.
441
And the first part of that is the little tech.
442
And we say little tech specifically is differentiated from big tech.
443
I look that creates a cleavage.
444
Yeah, that's right.
445
That was another thing we discovered.
446
That was a result of kind of our early interactions four or five years ago in DC, which is just they're just like, well, tech is tech.
447
You know, we just meet with them on behalf of startups and they start yelling at us about Google or something.
448
And it's like, we're not here representing Google.
449
And it's like, that's tech.
450
And by the way, it was a startup 20 years ago.
451
And we're just like, well, look, Google, they have 10,000 lawyers and policy people and compliance people.
452
They've got their own, they can carry their own water.
453
That's not what we're here for.
454
And in fact, a lot of what the venture ecosystem does is it funds competition.
455
This is the story I was telling DC, which is 100% true, which is the caricature of this sort of reckless Silicon Valley, is that we're starting companies that go disrupt whatever healthcare or something.
456
I said, most of what our founders are trying to disrupt is big tech.
457
And I said, frankly, big tech companies, they would say they have a love hate.
458
We like them, but they have a love-hate relationship with us because we're the escape hatch.
459
If there's somebody at a big tech company that basically gets frustrated, they come to us to raise money to start a company to compete with their former employer.
460
And so big tech is not always in favor of us.
461
And then, look, big tech, they just have become very big companies and they have their own agendas.
462
And a lot of big companies over time try to form cartel basically structures to prevent new competitors and startups from emerging.
463
And so we just noticed in more and more cases there was a divergence of interests.
464
That actually turned out to help a lot.
465
The minute we figured that out, and then we start going to this little tech thing and kind of ran with it.
466
Like immediately that was like the icebreaker because everybody in DC hates big tech.
467
They only agree on two things.
468
They only agree on big tech and China.
469
This is the only two things they agree on, but they really agree on those things.
470
And in big tech, they just all hate big tech.
471
And so the minute we say we're not here on behalf of big tech, we're on behalf of little tech.
472
And in fact, our companies attack big tech, we get like these huge smiles.
473
They're like, oh, wow, tech startups are actually good.
474
This is actually exciting.
475
So that's the little tech side.
476
And then the agenda side is it's essentially freedom to innovate.
477
So the ability for companies in new fields that are not completely yet well understood, that lawmakers of the past did not anticipate that they should actually be able to operate.
478
And then the other maybe important thing is we're not like lobbying for no regulation.
479
So sometimes we get tagged by, you know, we're these crazy libertarians and we want these companies to just run wild and like admit fraud and do all this crazy stuff.
480
And that's not what we're pushing for.
481
We want clarity.
482
We want clarity.
483
We want clarity.
484
We want clarity.
485
We want clear guidelines.
486
We want sensible rules.
487
We always tell these people, like, consumer protection regulation go crazy.
488
Like 100%, no problem.
489
That's all good.
490
In fact, we want that because we want our companies to be compliant.
491
We certainly don't want our companies committing fraud.
492
We are advocating on behalf of regulation as often as we're doing anything else.
493
You know, it's funny on Twitter, there was this sort of Paul Graham-Palantir dust-up the other week, which I thought was just pretty symbolic or emblematic.
494
I'm not to pick on Paul, it was sort of like older Silicon Valley versus newer Silicon Valley, or just like how the space has changed.
495
You know, Palantir has to work with the government.
496
They're building hard tech.
497
It's not just sort of put something up and talk to customers right away.
498
And Paul Graham has been in England for quite a bit.
499
You know, YC is still innovating, doing fantastic things.
500
But I just thought that was such a fascinating example of how Silicon Valley is evolving, which is just new kinds of companies, new kinds of go-to-markets, new kinds of sort of ethos.
501
That's right.
502
And so the specific dust-up, I think, was over Palantir working with ICE, the U.S.
503
government immigration agency.
504
So this is a generational change.
505
I think this is a very deep and profound change.
506
And there's a generational aspect of this, which is basically, so the U.S.
507
tech industry and startup industry in Silicon Valley were basically deeply intertwined with the defense and intelligence, the sort of deep state defense and intelligence agencies, in particular the federal government.
508
Really, if you go all the way back, Steve Blank has these incredible videos, essays where he goes through all this all the way back.
509
Silicon Valley actually started in like the 1920s and it was like defense tech in the 1920s.
510
It was like radar, right?
511
And like early missile guidance systems and avionics systems and things like that in like the 20s and 30s.
512
And then from that time through to like basically the 1960s, it was just assumed that there was this very deep relationship and you know this whole war and of course the industry and government have to work together to build all these systems to defeat the Soviets.
513
One of the first computers literally was called Sage, which was a U.S.
514
government project, a giant mainframe computer for missile early warning systems.
515
So it was just assumed that this was all kind of hand in hand.
516
And then really what happened was it was Vietnam.
517
So Vietnam was the first modern war where you had this massive protest movement and then the college campuses went wild with this.
518
And what happened, if you talk to people who were involved back then, basically what happened was the leading edge American universities that did science and technology were doing military science and technology.
519
And many of them just stopped.
520
So like Stanford, there's this thing called Stanford Research Institute, SRI, that's actually no longer associated with Stanford because it's the remnants of what used to be Stanford's military RD.
521
MIT had something similar with the Lincoln Lab.
522
And so that created a culture in the Valley was always been a mix of right and left-wing, but you know, the hippie anti-war movement, a lot of it was in California, right?
523
A lot of it was at Stanford and Berkeley specifically.
524
And so there was just this mood shift.
525
Yeah, I guess we have the vibe shift now.
526
So in those days, it was like probably the groove shift.
527
Yeah, right.
528
So they call it the groove shift.
529
So the groove shift 50 years ago was no more work with the military.
530
No more.
531
U.S.
532
government is evil.
533
The U.S.
534
government is an evil, colonial, oppressive power wreaking havoc overseas.
535
And it would be better to have like disarmament and basically pacifism.
536
And the U.S.
537
should sort of give up all these foreign engagements.
538
And that was a very hot, very hot political topic because the Soviet Union was still up and running.
539
But anyway, as a result, like a lot of these universities, and then as a result, a lot of the companies just basically disengaged.
540
They just weren't willing to do that.
541
Another topic that became very hot at the time was ROTC recruiting.
542
So the military used to just actively recruit for new officers on these campuses.
543
And a lot of these colleges outlawed that 50 years ago.
544
Anyway, so I would say Paul, who's a very bright guy, Paul is from that era.
545
Not the Vietnam era, but like the arc that followed, like in the 80s and 90s, when it was just universally assumed that, of course, you don't try to enable the military industrial complex defense agencies.
546
I never really felt that way.
547
And maybe it's just, I don't know where I grew up or whatever, but I never really felt that way.
548
But I knew I was swimming in those waters for a long time.
549
My company, Netscape, was always very active with defense and intelligence.
550
We always leaned hard into it.
551
It's the only real thing that you're Alex Karf, I think, is a national hero.
552
The one thing when he does is he's volunteering as the first company has ever done this.
553
And I'm like, no, no, we were doing it 10 years earlier, but that's okay.
554
Call it, I don't know, neo-hippie 80s and 90s phase, where it's just clearly you don't do this.
555
And then to your point, now the Vive Shift, just now more recently with Palantir and Andrew.
556
And again, give Alex Karp huge credit, give Ryan and Palmer Luckey huge credit.
557
Peter, you know, these guys really led the way on this.
558
And so, yeah, of course you work with them because, number one, you're a business and their customer, and you shouldn't be like sitting there as like moral judge for like every single customer.
559
Yeah.
560
Because how are you going to do business if you're just sitting there having these moral conversations all day long?
561
And then, number two, it's like, all right, these national missions actually matter, right?
562
And the border one is very inflammatory, but just say most people in the history of civilization have thought that borders are an important and valid thing, going back many thousands of years.
563
And then, yeah, I mean, is the world a safer place because the U.S.
564
is in it versus not and because the U.S.
565
military is strong versus weak?
566
And do we want to protect ourselves against terror attacks?
567
Yeah.
568
And so I think there's a lot of us that are like, oh, clearly we want to do those things.
569
And I'm encouraged by it because I think things are headed in the right direction according to what I want.
570
But I also recognize that these are serious underlying moral, philosophical, and ethical questions.
571
And I like, I don't question Paul's intent.
572
I think when he says those things, he's operating out of a very strong sense of ethics and morals.
573
Right.
574
Totally.
575
Well, it goes to your early.
576
I disagree with him.
577
Yes.
578
Software is eating the world and it didn't stop at social networks or marketplaces, right?
579
He got into area networking, he got into everything.
580
Yeah.
581
And in fact, what happened, if you go to DC and if you talk to people who run the defense intelligence agencies in DC, almost every topic that they talk about or think about has a major tech component to it.
582
Yeah.
583
Like almost every single one.
584
Just the Ukrainian battlefield is a completely new kind of battlefield because of all this new drone technology and all these things.
585
That's basically true for like every area of basically national geopolitical policy has a big tech component to it.
586
Right.
587
And of course, my approach is obviously we should be in the middle of that.
588
And obviously we should be investing against that and trying to help those things happen.
589
But I understand why people get uncomfortable with it.
590
Yeah.
591
That's a professional.
