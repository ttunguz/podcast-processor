1
Now, things are different.
2
First of all, you have all these different layers that are orthogonal that back up each one, you know, from another, looking to the same try-to-forecast.
3
I call it precision medical forecast.
4
Like the weather forecasting, AI is completely revamping that, making it at accuracy levels that are hard to fathom how great it will be.
5
The same thing is true here.
6
So, basically, the difference is you've got all these additional layers of data we didn't have.
7
And what's really noteworthy is you can give a person's projection in time when this is going to be an issue if they don't do anything about it.
8
About the science of aging, it's not about the drugs, it's about being able to, you know, clock a person, a person, and their organ systems, including their immune system.
9
We never had that before.
10
That's what's different right now.
11
AI is everywhere right now.
12
But with all the buzz, how do you cut through the noise and focus on what really matters?
13
If you're looking to dive deep into the big questions shaping AI's role in business today, you need to tune in to Where AI Works: Conversations at the Intersection of AI and Industry.
14
Brought to you by the Wharton School in collaboration with Accenture.
15
Each episode cuts through the hype, blending cutting-edge research from Wharton professors with real-world case studies.
16
You will discover how leading companies are leveraging AI to upskill their teams, boost productivity, and streamline operations.
17
And you will hear directly from executives and industry pioneers who are implementing AI in their businesses today.
18
No fluff, just practical insights.
19
Listen to Where AI Works Now on your favorite podcast app and get the strategies that matter most for today's business leaders.
20
Introduce yourself to listeners.
21
Obviously, you're a doctor, but how you got so deeply involved in the tech space and what your book is about, and then we'll talk about that.
22
Well, I'm Dr.
23
Eric Topo.
24
I am a professor and EDP at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California.
25
I've been involved from the earliest days of digital medicine back in the 90s with biosensors, with smartphones connected to the internet, even before there was a real digital infrastructure.
26
So, back many years ago, I wrote a book called The Creative Destruction of Medicine, which was about going digital in medicine.
27
And then, most recently, about to be published is a book called Super Agers.
28
It's actually about using AI to promote health span.
29
It has not been previously laid out like that.
30
It's a blueprint for how we can go forward.
31
And we couldn't do it without the current types of models with AI, and that's what makes it especially exciting.
32
Yeah, I just saw Bill Gates at an interview talking about how someday soon, within the next decade, we're all going to be accessing medical information through agents, AI agents.
33
So, super agers, the yeah, give me the thesis of the book.
34
Is it about how AI is going to spread knowledge, or is it more about aging strategies or how to combat aging?
35
Yeah, so there are the three major age-related diseases: heart, neurodegenerative Alzheimer's, and cancer.
36
They all take 20 years to incubate.
37
They all have common threads.
38
And now we can tell in any given individual who is at high risk by a full stack of data, depth that we've never had before.
39
But that's not including, not just including electronic health records, and labs and images, but it's also including the genome, proteins, metabolites, the gut microbiome, environmental exposures, social determinants of health.
40
Anyway, for all these different layers of data, the AI will tell us if you are at high risk, when, pinpointing when this will show up and nothing is done, and then that can be used to direct surveillance and prevention strategies.
41
So you never have one of those three age-related diseases, which are the biggest burden of our chronic disease and killers, of course.
42
So this is an exciting time.
43
It's unique.
44
It's momentous in many respects because we didn't have the AI that could input, ingest all this data, and we didn't have the data to ingest.
45
So what we have now is just extraordinary time to be able to help each person know, especially at a younger age, what's in store for them and to do these things that would help prevent, at the very least, markedly delay a condition.
46
Yeah, and that data, I mean, there are two issues.
47
One issue that's kept a lot of healthcare data locked up and inaccessible to AI models, but also personal health data that is not necessarily digitized or very complete, longitudinal.
48
I mean, I've moved around the country.
49
I don't know where all my data, not the country, the world, where all my data is, if it exists.
50
How do you tackle those two problems?
51
I mean, first of all, on just more broadly, in order to train models, you need access to large populations, data of large populations.
52
And I've talked to people, spoken to people over the years about that.
53
It seems that that's been addressed to a certain extent.
54
But where do you see that today and how it's going to improve?
55
Okay, well, firstly, the data story that you bring up is that I've written about extensively, even had a book about it, the patient will see now.
56
People should have all their data.
57
It's their data.
58
They should own it.
59
And it should be kept in a secure platform.
60
And so other countries do that, just not here in the U.S.
61
But that's the ideal scenario because you're not going to put your genome sequencing data or your biosensor data or other layers of data into your electronic health record because we don't protect people fully for things like disability insurance and life insurance and various things that are not related to health insurance and the so-called gena, the discrimination of people about their genetic information.
62
So we have to come up with a better plan about where all that data sits and that each person is entitled, is their data, their body, that's critical.
63
Now, it turns out the AM models that we have now are very well suited for supervised fine-tuning for this task.
64
I mean, the fact is they're multimodal, they're now foundation, we can use, of course, domain-specific agents.
65
But no problem here with respect to the models.
66
If you were talking pre-transformer architecture, yes.
67
But in the current environment, we even are getting these reasoning capabilities.
68
And it's not like a lot of these things have to be outputs in seconds.
69
We can wait minutes, hours, days, even for the best output.
70
So the models are not to hold up.
71
The data ownership is actually an issue that has to be grappled with.
72
In the meantime, though, many people have been able to collect all their data, curate everything of theirs, particularly engineers and certain people, patients of mine that have everything.
73
And so they're very well suited to enact this now.
74
And is.
75
Okay, so that's the person.
76
What about this more universal data to train the models?
77
Yeah, it's surprising that it's not as big a challenge as you would expect because a lot of the things in medicine and life science, we would never have predicted that the models that already were appearing, like in GBT-4 and LAMA and others, really were remarkably well suited for this, just by having ingested everything known to mankind about medicine and the whole corpus of knowledge related to this.
78
So in the work that's been done so far to look at being able to predict the arc of a person's, let's say, risk for Alzheimer's and when they would get out.
79
We can do that now.
80
We don't need new models, in fact.
81
So the difference now is, Craig, is that up until now, let's say you had a so-called polygenic risk score where you could go to 23ME or a whole bunch of different companies.
82
They tell you, you know, Craig, you have a risk of, it's high for, let's say, Alzheimer's disease.
83
And the only problem with that is, well, there are two problems.
84
One is it might not be that accurate.
85
But the bigger problem is, what if the risk is when you're 98 rather than 68?
86
They're different.
87
And there was no way to be able to ascribe a time range.
88
Now things are different.
89
First of all, you have all these different layers that are orthogonal that back up.
90
I call it precision medical forecasting.
91
Like the weather forecasting, AI is completely revamping that, making it at accuracy levels that are hard to fathom, how great it will be.
92
The same thing is true here.
93
So basically, the difference is you've got all these additional layers of data we didn't have.
94
And what's really noteworthy is you can give a person's projection in time when this is going to be an issue.
95
They don't do anything about it.
96
Now, many of the interventions or preventive tactics involve lifestyle changes.
97
And we know a lot of those, but most people don't do any of those or change behaviors.
98
But we've also learned that when you have specific knowledge about yourself, the chances of you taking on some of these changes are much higher.
99
So it would now much more specifically bespoke to your situation.
100
But by the way, it isn't just lifestyle changes that can help prevent these conditions.
101
I mean, obviously, there's surveillance, whether it's cancer surveillance with multi-cancer early detection blood tests, or whether it's surveillance for neurodegeneration with these new P-Tower 217 biomarkers, which was a really big breakthrough.
102
Each of these disease, age-related diseases, has ways we can stay ahead of it.
103
Yeah.
104
Just reminds me, it's an aside.
105
So this is really about prediction.
106
Yes.
107
I've been talking over the years.
108
No, I know him.
109
He sends me stuff all the time.
110
Yeah.
111
Well, and his, you know, he's all on, you know, anti-aging, and that's kind of his motivation.
112
And he's, you know, he's got a very sophisticated process for drug discovery and molecule synthesis.
113
Yeah.
114
And he's working on inflammatory diseases because he sees that as one of the major manifestations of aging that end up leading to death.
115
Yeah, fibrosis.
116
Yeah.
117
Have you looked at, in the book, do you look at using this technology to develop drugs to target specific diseases that are endemic to aging?
118
Yeah, so this is, I do review all the different strategies that are now being pursued.
119
And, you know, everything from partial epigenetic reprogramming to, you name, or, you know, different repair, like what in silicon medicine is on to with pulmonary fibrosis.
120
You know, I review all that, but basically the conclusion is there, these are years away, if ever.
121
You know, things like synolytics to take out our senescent cells in our body, but it can't tell the good senescent cells from the bad senescent cells.
122
So they're risky, they're iffy, they're often time.
123
But today, what we can achieve is using AI tools and rich data, deep data for each person, to forecast like we've never been able to do before.
124
And so one of the biggest breakthroughs was these so-called organ clocks.
125
So where Alex and I and many others in the anti-aging field converge is there have been dramatic advances in the science of aging.
126
And what is an outgrowth of that are these things, these molecular clocks, like epigenetic clocks, like the Horovath clock, where you look at methyl groups on the DNA.
127
There's also organ clocks of from a tube of blood, you can get 11,000 plasma proteins that will tell you which organ.
128
So say, Craig, all your organs are great, but it turns out your heart is seven years accelerated aging, which tells us right away, you know, that's what we've got to zoom in and for you.
129
So we're seeing tools that we never have, you know, breakthrough tests about the science of aging.
130
It's not about the drugs.
131
It's about being able to clock a person, a person, and their organ systems, including their immune system.
132
We never had that before.
133
That's what's different right now.
134
And with these different proteins and assays, we can say, hmm, we measured it this year.
135
We measured it this year.
136
Oh, that means for you to be worried about this, if you don't really go full core practice.
137
So, with that point, that we have 20 years to undo the natural history of risk, this is a whole different strategy.
138
The book is about a different strategy than the one that these companies are pursuing, like Altos Labs and Unity, and in Silico.
139
You know, there's 50 of these anti-aging companies, right?
140
I'm saying, good, good luck to them.
141
I hope they're successful.
142
But I have a different plan that's not risky, okay?
143
Because preventing diseases is a dream in medicine that's been a fantasy that's been around for multiple millennium.
144
Now we have a chance to do something about it.
145
Yeah.
146
How much of this is productized at this point?
147
Everything's like, yeah, you're right, everything's piecemeal.
148
So you got to go here to get your organ clock.
149
You got to go here to get your epigenetic clock.
150
You got to go here to get your metabolome, you know, here to go to get your gut microbiome.
151
So it isn't, the package isn't, but you could do it.
152
You can do it.
153
It's just that the AI tool is separated from each of the layers of data.
154
It's just a matter of time when this comes together.
155
Yeah.
156
Your point is a good one, Craig.
157
Yeah, I just wrote a piece for Forbes about MCP.
158
I can remember what it stands for, but this Anthropic developed standard protocol for connecting AI systems to disparate data sources or disparate tools and that sort of thing.
159
This one is being cracked every day with multi-omic.
160
So in the life science field, which is what this is really converging with, they already are looking at every layer of DNA, RNA, single sequence, a single cell sequence, nucleus, and all the other ones I've mentioned.
161
They've already figured out how to do all that.
162
And that's exciting because that's just part of this.
163
All you've got to do is add in a couple of traditional medical pieces like the electronic records, which contain labs and images, and you're there.
164
Yeah.
165
In the book, do you go through how somebody could collect all of this data?
166
Because for the layperson, I would, I mean, just the list that you mentioned, I don't know anything about, did you say melanome?
167
Oh, the metabolome.
168
Metabolome, yeah.
169
I mean, I don't know what that is, where it is, how I could find it.
170
Yeah, well, there's a company, Metabolon, that does that and other companies as well.
171
I don't go through that step by step.
172
I'm just basically trying to say, look, folks, we're going to a new era where you're going to know your risk.
173
And I lay out, you know, what are the layers of data, how we're going to do this.
174
In the next year or two, we'll see the companies that have the whole package.
175
Right now, there's these companies pitching data for longevity.
176
I mean, this is not my science.
177
But they have the right idea, okay?
178
Because some of them are assembling these different layers of data already.
179
They're not using AI.
180
Sometimes they say on their website they use AI, but no, they're not.
181
They're not real AI.
182
So we're already seeing the budding.
183
You know, there are several companies that this is in their sites right now.
184
And it's not going to take long for them to adapt to the opportunity, which, you know, this is a very clear path to achieving something we've never been able to do before.
185
Our ability to give a person's risk assessment of a disease has been rudimentary at best, but actually incredibly weak and inaccurate.
186
And it's our most important thing is that we should be knowing well in advance what we have to prevent and how we do it.
187
Yeah, and one thing you said, I was thinking as you were talking, you know, I've looked a lot at EdTech and I've spoken to a couple of companies that have an assembly of algorithms.
188
And one of the things that struck me as most promising is that you can have a knowledge tracing algorithm that tracks the knowledge of a student as the student studies, provided that they're interacting digitally, and then you can have a prediction algorithm that predicts the student's score in an exam or in a course.
189
And then you can have a recommendation engine that recommends stuff to fill in the knowledge gaps.
190
And when you put it all together, I mean, theoretically, the student, if he follows the recommendations, can see his predicted score going up.
191
And that's a huge motivator.
192
It could be the same thing with more compelling because it's your lifespan that you're increasing, not yeah, exactly.
193
And just to add to it, so you know the likes of Jeff Hinton, Demis Pasabas, Gustavo Silliman, all three of them reviewed the book, and they all thought this is extraordinary.
194
They supplied endorsements, not, you know, because they see that, you know, both, actually, both Demis and Jeff have said that the most important ever use of AI will be to improve our health.
195
And this is, I think, and thus I don't know, Craig, but I don't think anybody has laid out how we're going to do this yet.
196
This is kind of, that's why I'm excited about it.
197
And they were excited about it.
198
So, you know, we have now a way, it's very similar to what you just described in education.
199
Of course, it's a totally different application.
200
It's a little more complex, but it's ready to go.
201
It's not going to take long to get there.
202
Building multi-agent software is hard.
203
How do you achieve accuracy and consistency in non-deterministic agentic apps?
204
That's where agency comes in: AGNTCY.
205
The agency is an open source collective building the Internet of Agents.
206
And what's the Internet of Agents?
207
It's a collaboration layer where AI agents can communicate, discover each other, and work across frameworks.
208
For developers, this means standardized agent discovery tools, seamless protocols for interagent communication, and modular components to compose and scale multi-agent workflows.
209
Build with other engineers who care about high-quality multi-agent software.
210
Build with other engineers who care about high-quality multi-agent software.
211
Visit agency.org and add your support.
212
That's agntcy.org.
213
Yeah.
214
Are you free to mention companies that you think are on the right track in coming out with an application?
215
Well, I reviewed all of them that are out there.
216
And, you know, I'll just pull up the chart I made from the ground truths that I did.
217
One sec here, if you can bear with me.
218
Sure.
219
Yeah, I just put it out a week ago.
220
I called it the business of promoting longevity.
221
Basically, the 12 companies, there was one that started this years ago, a decade ago, called Human Longevity.
222
They get total body MRI and genome sequence.
223
This was before there was any AI.
224
I got all these labs and whatnot.
225
That company is just basically almost non-existent now, charging $25,000 to come and have all these things done.
226
That's a no-brainer, not going to work.
227
Function Health, they do 100 lab tests.
228
That's it.
229
So that's not exactly what we're talking about.
230
And of the ones, LifeForce is, I think, on the right track.
231
Let's see, going down the list, Fountain Life is trying to get a whole lot of tests.
232
Actually, when you look at them, they have the right idea that you need more layers of data, but none of them are getting the right data.
233
I wrote about that in the post.
234
They have this idea that, oh, if I know much more data about a person, I can guide them.
235
They're just not getting the right data.
236
And they don't, none of these companies have a significant AI effort yet.
237
But some of them have raised immense capital.
238
Like, for example, Function has a valuation of $2.5 billion already.
239
It has 50,000 members and a wait list.
240
Necco Health has 100,000 people on a wait list.
241
So people want this.
242
But they're a little clueless about they're not getting what they should get.
243
Yeah.
244
Are you advising?
245
I mean, you obviously are deep.
246
Well, why you have a deep knowledge of AI and you have a deep knowledge of medicine?
247
Have you thought about doing exactly what we're talking about?
248
Yeah, I mean, okay, so the function health, the one that has this massive valuation, one of the principals is a doctor named Mark Hyman.
249
He flew here, right?
250
He was sitting in my office and he offered me to be part of the company and get all sorts of financial incentives.
251
I told him, Mark, I just can't do that.
252
Because if I do that, then people will read this book or see me as, you know, I'm doing this for financial gain, just like they sell supplement, which I don't agree with.
253
That's another reason I wouldn't do it, right?
254
So basically, I can't, for me, it's much more important to put out the ideas and not have any profit motive whatsoever.
255
Yeah.
256
Yeah, well, I didn't mean it so much as profit motive.
257
I mean, obviously, you've had a financially lucrative career, but just as you see the problem, you see the solution, you have the knowledge, and certainly the contacts to pull together a team that could solve the problem.
258
Well, I just wanted to get it done.
259
And like I have done in the other previous books, I gave a lot of people the ideas.
260
So many people have written me or come visit me and tell me, you know, I built my company because of what you wrote.
261
And that's kind of what I'm hoping: is other people can execute.
262
Now, the reason I mentioned these companies, they already have a head start.
263
They have revenue, they have, you know, some of them have pretty strong participation, memberships, whatever.
264
So I'm perfectly happy to see them pivot, do this right, get there where we eventually all will be.
265
I don't want this to be a thing just for the affluent either.
266
In fact, the people who need this the most are the ones who can't access or afford it.
267
Yeah.
268
How much of this, I mean, you understand the relevant data, how to get the relevant data.
269
How much of that have you done yourself?
270
Most of it.
271
So in the book, I got an immunome, the beginning of an immunome, from a company, Infiniti Bio, Johns Hopkins spin-off, which is another essential part of the layers of data.
272
I've had most of the other layers of data, you know.
273
So I have done this, and the only risk of this big three that I'm facing is the cardiovascular risk.
274
And so now I know what I got to do.
275
I'm going to get my LDL down to the lowest level, and 10 other things that I got to do.
276
But there's things that, you know, turning to much better sleep, health, getting much better deep sleep, and many other things that we can do.
277
Once we know, you know, what we're up to.
278
Now, if you find that you don't have a risk for one of these big three diseases, well, you're lucky, right?
279
It doesn't mean you should go out and go into self-destruct mode, but you're lucky.
280
The point is, most people, one of them, top 5%, top 10%, that's something that is still going to be debatable for years to come.
281
What is risk, right?
282
Well, and you were talking about the timing, predicting the timing of risk.
283
How accurate do you think that can be?
284
I mean, yeah, I think it can be, it's hard to get it on one shot.
285
But if you have a person that you see is at high risk, by the time you do a second assessment, then you have it.
286
So if you have just two points on the curve, you'll know what's about the brain amyloid accumulation, what about microscopic cancer showing up, what about atheroma forming in arteries.
287
So, yeah, it doesn't take, it's hard to do it on a single point basis, but two data points separated in time by six months or a year, and you nail the key is that first baseline to determine the risk and then use the second point to determine the timing.
288
Yeah.
289
And for the timing, for example, let's pick one, cancer.
290
Yeah, yeah.
291
You know, you look at your family history, you look at presumably different biomarkers, maybe your personal genome.
292
What would the prediction be?
293
That in three years, in 15, 20 years, you have a 95%.
294
I mean, what does the prediction look like?
295
Okay, well, the 95%, that's what we were talking about earlier, top 5%, that would be 95%, or very high risk, that is.
296
Somewhere I'm thinking, you know, most people, if they're not in the top 5 or 10%, they're not going to really, that's really where you draw the threshold.
297
That's where some medical health systems, like, for example, Mass General Brigham, has drawn the threshold for genetic risk.
298
So let's just say we're talking about top 5 or 10%.
299
We're not likely to get out a readout that this is going to happen in 18 years, but certainly when it's more approximate, like three to five years, that would be the way it shows.
300
Now, how do we get this?
301
Well, it turns out, and I make a really important point early in the book, we have overestimated the family history genetic story.
302
Now, for cancer, it's more of an issue than it is for the other two, because if you have any of these cancer predisposition genes, I'm not just talking about BRCA genes, but other genes, that puts you in a different strata of risk.
303
But the point being here is that there are many other factors like the level of your body inflammation, those organ clocks, again, your whole body aging clock.
304
If you're seeing things that are out of kilter, and then you get a multi-cancer early detection test, the chance of that being abnormal, see, today, what's amazing, these tests are advocated for people age 50, period.
305
Now, talk about a senseless way to use a test.
306
Okay, but when you use that test, when you have these other things that are suggesting increased risk, then the yield is so much higher.
307
I mean, this is Bayes' theorem.
308
So that's how we get the risk of cancer nailed down.
309
And then, of course, if there's an organ clock that's already showing up, you can start to, and you're going to get images, of course, like a total body MRI if you really, but the multi-center cancer detection test already with AI can tell you which organ is lighting up most of the time.
310
Very accurate, actually.
311
So the cancer story, I think, is not that hard to see through.
312
As long as you don't say it's just the genes, that's our biggest problem.
313
Is we think we have this kind of over emphasis about our family history and this kind of dooms, impending doom thing that we live our whole life.
314
And my father had a heart attack when he was 50, and you think about that all the time.
315
We got to get that out of our system because that just doesn't really play out.
316
We did a so-called welderly study, we called it here.
317
1,400 people lived through past age 85, never sick, none of these diseases.
318
We sequenced the whole genome, all of them.
319
And what did we find?
320
Very little, almost nothing.
321
So the secret in the genes thing is not that much to it.
322
There's a little, but not much.
323
Yeah.
324
Let me think, where do we go with this?
325
The conclusion of the book then is that there's this promising technology that's here and there's ways to get the data to make the technology useful.
326
What are you, this is, I would presume, not only for AI technicians, but for general readers.
327
What is the recommendation?
328
I mean, what is the book telling us to do?
329
Well, there's a whole chapter on these lifestyle things that, you know, it'd be great if we adopted all those now, right?
330
Because without even knowing your risk for a particular condition, it'd be good.
331
But I review all the data, you know, everything from protein and ultra-processed foods and environmental hazards, microplastic.
332
I mean, all this stuff.
333
Each of us have at least some potential to affect, right?
334
And then I get into what I call, you know, brimming with optimism that we have a much more exciting way to go forward in medicine, to be able to be informative early in a person's life.
335
And I mean, it's never too late, but for people of our age, but even better as somebody in their 40s or 50s or younger even.
336
But the point here is that I think is transformative in medicine.
337
We couldn't do it without multimodal AI models that exist today and keep getting better.
338
And we couldn't do it without the layers of data that were discovered largely through the science of aging.
339
But a lot of people are using that, you know, of course, for companies to come up with drugs.
340
And I'm saying, no, no, no.
341
We got it for a different purpose now.
342
And let's stamp out age-related diseases.
343
Let's do it.
344
So the book leaves the lay reader, I hope, with an optimistic view in otherwise pretty dark times for life science right now when our funding is getting gutted every day.
345
People are getting laid off from NIH, FDA, CDC.
346
So on the one hand, the world isn't doing too well right now.
347
But here's something that's hopefully exciting to read about, know where we're headed.
348
I mean, each of the books I've written, this is my fourth book, probably my last book, is about the future of medicine.
349
And this one is the most exciting yet.
350
This one, I think, is something we can really make a huge difference in the future.
351
Yeah.
352
You know, there's a lot of talk about personalized medicine and with the ability now to edit the genome and create novel proteins.
353
What's your view just generally?
354
I know this is not what your book's about, but about the promise of precision personalized medicine becoming widely available.
355
Yeah, I'm really glad you asked that, Craig, because this is the nuts of it right here.
356
We haven't really done it.
357
You know, here and there we did a little with, oh, well, you have this mutation and cancer, we're going to treat you with this drug.
358
But precision medicine largely has been a disappointment.
359
It's been talked about a lot, but we haven't achieved it.
360
This is our segue.
361
This is a way to get there because we didn't have the depth of data.
362
So when we talk about precision individualized medicine, we couldn't really define the person well.
363
We're still missing the immunome data, which is one of the most, if not the most important layer, but there are companies that are pursuing that intensely right now.
364
And I tried one of them, and there's a couple others, a group at Stanford that plans a spin out of a company that does B and T cell sequencing that looks really exciting.
365
So we just didn't have the goods to do it.
366
And it was all talk and no action, largely.
367
Now we have the goods, and I hope we have the action.
368
I don't want to keep you too much longer, but you also mentioned epigenetic research or strategies.
369
I had Sebastiano Vittorio Sebastiano on the podcast years ago, who works on using Yamanaka factors to hold back the aging of cells.
370
And you mentioned the risk is that a lot of this leads to cancer.
371
But what do you feel about that?
372
And you mentioned organ-specific, or I don't remember the word you use, but treating specific groups of cells epigenetically.
373
Sedescent cells.
374
Yeah.
375
Yeah.
376
So the first one you mentioned is huge bets have been put on this.
377
Many companies are pursuing the Yama Naka factors.
378
And a brief exposure to them and you can turn an old mouse into a young mouse.
379
I mean, it's like, wow.
380
But the problem is, is that you can't just give these a shot to somebody with muscle.
381
Excuse me.
382
Then you have a real risk of tumor.
383
So what's fascinating is these companies have figured out you just can't give it like you can give it to a mouse.
384
So what they're trying to do is figure out how can you do a human trial.
385
So one of the companies is thinking about going in the knee for people who have horrible knee arthritis that otherwise need a knee replacement.
386
Another company is putting it in the eye.
387
You know, so they're not achieving the fountain of youth here.
388
They're going to try to do it in a limited compartment test zone, if you will, right?
389
It's going to be dicey because we've already learned that the exposure to those powerful factors.
390
It's like the reward's really high, but putting that in human, it's going to take a long time before we see a whole human get exposure to those intravenously or whatever systemic pathway.
391
The other companies, like I mentioned, that these senescent cells that are thought to be bad actors because they secrete very noxious proteins and they rev up inflammation in the body.
392
The problem is some of them are really good.
393
And we don't have a way to say, just go after the bad actors.
394
We leave the good ones that are promoting healing and doing lots of good things.
395
So we don't have smart ways to eradicate the bad cells.
396
And if you go through each of these, and there's at least 10 different ideas, which I go through in the book, they all carry significant risk.
397
They're all some years away.
398
And I hope that they're successful.
399
But they're not here and now.
400
What we've been talking about in this conversation is a kind of here and now thing, right?
401
It can be done today or imminently.
402
Those are years off and maybe never.
403
I hope they're successful.
404
Each one of them has some good ideas, but we'll see.
405
Yeah.
406
Another thing about sort of the aging debate that you hear people talk about, I'm just curious what your view is.
407
Of course, I want to live much longer than I'm slated to live.
408
But if everybody added five years to their lifespan, the demand for resources would quickly be overwhelming.
409
I mean, how do you balance a human desire with resources?
410
Yeah, well, first say the desire really isn't for lifespan, it's for health span, right?
411
I mean, if they're demented, they don't really want to live longer.
412
So you're right.
413
I mean, it's hard to meet a person when you talk about would you like to live healthier, you know, long life.
414
And, you know, rarely would you say no.
415
You hear someone say no.
416
So the demand will be high.
417
And, you know, what we're talking about here is largely software because these tests that get you those additional layers, they can be done inexpensively.
418
You know, every one of these is, you know, it's below $100, $50, you know.
419
So even if you take the whole package, it's not like putting somebody in a total body MRI, which now you're getting into the thousands.
420
So the interesting thing is it may get done in other countries before the U.S.
421
because we have terrible perverse incentives here.
422
We have these insurance companies that they don't think they're going to have you next year, so they only care about immediate gratification, right?
423
Whereas if you're in other countries, like I was asked to review the National Health Service in the UK, they're representative of most other rich countries, which is they take care of all their people for life.
424
So they're going to be the countries that make these, you know, basically implement.
425
And here it will be more likely to be, you know, if you're affluent and you, you know, the demand, I do think the demand will ultimately be high, you know, some years out from now when this is widely available.
426
But we're not in a good position in this country to make it equitable or accessible relative to other countries because they can see a small investment can lead to a huge downstream reductions of cost, no less healthier lives.
427
Yeah.
428
Yeah.
429
Okay.
430
Well, this is just fascinating, and I'm going to go buy the book right now on Amazon.
431
It's coming out May.
432
I could send you the PDF if you like instead of.
433
Yeah, I don't mind pre-ordering it.
434
I'm waiting to get the actual hard copy tomorrow or Thursday, finally.
435
Yeah.
436
And I think it was Stephen Morrow that got us together.
437
Is that right?
438
I'd have to go back.
439
Oh, okay.
440
I thought maybe he was the one that you said you got to talk to Craig.
441
I don't know.
442
Well, it may very well have been.
443
Anyway, it's been a joy, Craig.
444
I really enjoy.
445
You asked a lot of great questions that I think are really spot on.
446
Yeah, well, I'm probably, once I get the book, well, how about this?
447
I just, my wife writes, and I always think you should, people, if they're interested in a book, they should buy it, not get a free copy.
448
But if you could send me the PDF, I'll write something.
449
I'm a contributor at Forbes, not that that gets a lot of traction, but.
450
Oh, great.
451
Darren, can you send me your email address?
452
Yeah, I'll do it right after this.
453
Excellent.
454
All right.
455
We'll get it off to you.
456
