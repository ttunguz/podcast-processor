1
Hey, everyone, welcome to Generative Now.
2
I am Michael McNano.
3
I am a partner at Lightspeed, and this week I'm talking with Gabe Stengel, the founder and CEO of Rogo.
4
Rogo is a platform that uses AI to do what junior bankers usually spend sleepless weeks, days, and nights doing: analyzing earnings, benchmarking companies, and building pitch decks.
5
And it does it all in seconds.
6
Gabe was a former analyst at the investment bank Lazard.
7
And so he saw firsthand just how inefficient finance can be.
8
And so he and his co-founders built Rogo to fix that.
9
Now the world's top banks and hedge funds are using the product, and investors are betting big on their success.
10
Gabe and I talked about his time working in investment banking, how that led him to the idea for Rogo, and where he sees AI fitting into the future of banking moving forward.
11
Let's dive in.
12
Hey, Gabe, how's it going?
13
Good.
14
How are you?
15
Thanks for having me.
16
Doing well.
17
Thanks for doing this.
18
Been really looking forward to this and talking to you about Rogo.
19
Obviously, well, I don't know.
20
How long is it?
21
How long has it been?
22
When did you guys found the company?
23
Late 2021.
24
So three and a half years-ish.
25
So it's been a little while.
26
From what I know about it, it's got a pretty cool inception story, especially given your background as an investment banker.
27
Tell us a little bit about how you guys got started.
28, I guess the LLC that we rolled into the C Corp that is Rogo was started in 2019 because John, who's my co-founder, is one of my best friends at Princeton, where we both went to school.
29
And we collaborated on our senior thesis, which was a research project.
30
I was computer science, John was econ, and we basically jointly created an AI chatbot for financial econometrics.
31
It was not very good.
32
It was using old hat techniques, semantic parsing, context-free grammars, but it was very exciting to us.
33
And it was a tool we could put in front of our less tech-savvy econ friends and have them use it to do their theses and their work.
34
And so that's when we first had the idea and got excited about this idea of a natural language interface.
35
We tried to commercialize it at the time and couldn't really figure anything out.
36
So we ended up both going into finance.
37
I was an investment banker at Lazard.
38
John went to Barclays, then J.P.
39
Morgan.
40
And my experience at Lazard, I got a pretty unique position.
41
I got to be both on an investment banking team and then later on a data science team, helping find internal tools for the bank to roll out to make junior bankers more productive, senior bankers a little bit smarter.
42
And so just had unique visibility into both what the work junior bankers were doing were, but also how were these institutions even thinking about solving it.
43
And we left that job and those jobs and got started with building this company.
44
Tell us a little bit about a word you used early on in your story, econometrics.
45
Explain for the layman viewer, what are econometrics?
46
And also, how is the product, well, it sounds it was rooted in some early work you did in Princeton where this was really focused on econometrics to where you are now.
47
And we'll get deep into the history of the product and all that, but would love to understand the journey there.
48
There's absolutely no econometrics in the product now.
49
Back then, our product was really built for post-grads and undergrads doing econometric research, i.e., the simplest version is run a regression of X on Y or run an auto regression or find an instrumental variable, helping economics post-grads do,, do their work.
50, it's not really what we do now.
51
Today, the product is much more helping investors, investment bankers do research on companies, diligence companies, come up with unique investment theses.
52
We also still analyze structured data, but instead of analyzing economic structured data so much, we analyze company structured data, right?
53
So, you might say, run a regression of revenue multiples on margin expansion at big healthcare companies to see what's really been driving valuation over the past year.
54
Or just show me,, the share price returns year to date for this basket of companies.
55
But yeah, we don't really do that econometrics as much anymore.
56
But we had to put a spin on the project to make sure that John could log it as his senior thesis.
57
So we had to do the econometrics.
58
That's so funny.
59
Talk a little bit about your experience at Lazard.
60
And it sounds your co-founder had some similar experience that shaped the vision for what you wanted to do with Rogo.
61, at Lazard, were you doing the same types of analysis and research that you imagine users of Rogo doing now?
62
Oh, 100%.
63
Yeah, I was a banking analyst.
64
I was putting together models for potential buy-side acquisitions.
65
I was putting together PowerPoint decks.
66
I was doing research on industries.
67
I was putting together PIBs, public information books, which if you have any banking listeners on this podcast, they will understand what that is all too well.
68
Yeah, what is a PIB?
69
A PIB is basically a senior banker says, Hey, we're going to meet with, let's call it, data dog.
70
Give me a PIB on the company, i.e., put together all the resources I would need to get smart on this company over 24 hours.
71
So you pull, each MD has their own formula, but maybe the last two 10Ks, last 10Q, some initiating broker research coverage, some recent broker research coverage that's good, any interesting news articles that have come out recently into one,, 200-page condensed PDF that you email to them, and then they can leaf through and see if there's anything interesting or write you a follow-up.
72
So it's just an information packet to get started, which now is a little bit dated, right?
73 you don't need this 200-page research packet when you can just go into a tool Rogo or ChatGPT and say, hey, tell me about Datadog and what's been going on.
74
But yeah, I was doing the very basic banking work.
75
And I loved it.
76, I think there's this perception that no one likes investment banking.
77
I don't think that's true at all.
78, I think you get access to some of the most interesting executives, companies, see how they think, see how they think about MA capital allocation.
79
And I really enjoyed it.
80
Putting together a PIB, especially without AI, a couple of years ago,, it sounds a ton of work, especially if you're telling me these things need to come together in 24 hours.
81
And this is a 200-page PDF.
82, was the initial thinking, hey, this is a lot of manual work.
83
AI is obviously helping to give people leverage on work and units of intelligence.
84
Let's make this a PIP creator.
85
Was that the basic idea?
86
Yeah, I would say it's funny.
87, the basic idea was, yeah, there's all these types of work, benchmarking revenue multiples, putting together PIBs that are so basic and not interesting.
88
And there should be an AI tool that can do it.
89
But I would say the thesis then, and the thesis still now was always more so, how do we empower people to do things they can't do?
90
Right.
91
And that goes back to our original senior thesis, which was giving our peers the power of writing Python code through a natural language interface chatbot to do their econometrics work.
92
And even now, I want to make sure we're doing all the mundane work that junior bankers and junior investors do, but I also want to empower them to do things they've never done before, right?
93
I want to help them do all sorts of new types of analysis, new types of insight-generating work that wasn't possible before.
94
And so, even at the time, I think we had loftier aspirations.
95
It took us a while to even get to the mundane automation, but it was always focused on, hey, how can I give you, Mike, a tool that allows you to do the types of analysis that before you couldn't really do if you didn't have a team of data scientists or a team of juniors underneath you?
96
Got it.
97
So, it almost seems the thing that really becomes accessible with a tool Rogo, at least in the early days, was sort almost the data science function and the real deep analytical work.
98
Not necessarily the stuff that,, as you said, you can do a lot of this stuff in ChatGPT now through a deep research query.
99
Deep research, I'm sure, isn't doing a lot of the data science work, but it's probably doing some of the basic, just pulling of existing data and records to keep somebody just generally more high-level informed.
100, look, Rogo is in many ways deep research, except plugged into financial data sources and financial tools.
101
And so, instead of only having access to the web and a Python code interpreter environment, our deep research has access to the bank's internal data, their CRM, their SharePoint, their precedent transactions analyses.
102
And then it also has access to tools Excel, filings, FactSet, CapIQ, Pitchbook, all the financial data sources that they use.
103
And so, it's basically just deep research that's been trained to be a Wall Street analyst as opposed to just anyone's research analyst.
104
Yeah.
105
So, all right, let's talk about that a little bit.
106
So, you mentioned things Pitchbook.
107
These are,, these are data sources that are out there on the web.
108
You have to pay for them, but they're out there.
109
And then you mentioned the company's data.
110
Is that really the secret sauce there in that it takes your internal data that's proprietary, and then it links it up with all this stuff that's on the web, but maybe hard to get, and something ChatGPT can't just go and grab?
111
I would say there's three things that make Rogo special and our IP and make it a valuable product.
112
One, yes, is the content, the data that you have access to, right?
113
We work with providers SP Global CapIQ to make sure that we have,, if they, if we have mutual customers, they can query the CapIQ data through Rogo.
114
That is a business data licensing problem.
115
The second is the actual tools that the model has access to, right?
116
Even if you have this ingenious LLM, if it doesn't have access to a tool Excel, can it really build a full three-statement model?
117
It can in Python, but that's not auditable and it's not really built for that.
118
Can it make a PowerPoint output?
119
Maybe, but probably not the one that's up to your output specification.
120
The final thing that's different is our reasoning and the actual model quality.
121
And the same way that if you look at Cloud4 or Gemini 2.5 Pro or GPT 04 or 03, they're ingenious, super smart models, but they don't know how to use the tools, the data sets, and do the workflows that bankers and investors do.
122
And if you had Albert Einstein start at light speed on Monday, just because he's smarter than everyone at light speed, which may or may not be true, doesn't mean he'll be a valuable thing.
123
Maybe.
124
Maybe.
125
I don't think he would be valuable on day one.
126
He needs to learn how you guys think about a company, how you think about investments, how you use tools, what your formatting is, right?
127
And that's learning.
128
And so we teach the model how to do that by using a technique called post-training or reinforcement fine-tuning to learn how to use the tools that finance professionals use.
129
So these are your own models.
130
You're not using,, GPT.
131
Well, we build on top of those.
132
So it's okay, a lot of these platforms now offer fine-tuning on top of their models.
133
So you can fine-tune 4.0, you can fine-tune 2.5 Pro.
134
You can also distill these models into open source and then run reinforcement learning.
135, so we're not doing any pre-training,, but we are then,, doing post-training on these models.
136
Yeah, and you mentioned that you're you're fine-tuning them to work with the tools that people in this industry are working with.
137
Talk a little bit about that.
138, do you mean agentically using these tools?
139, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
140
If you were an analyst at Goldman and you started on Monday and someone said, Hey, find the precedent transactions for the Microsoft Activision deal, you would probably go to Edgar's, which is the SEC's list of filings, and start looking, Microsoft, Activision.
141
Look for the DEF 14A.
142
Okay, I found it.
143
Now I'm going to control F through the DEF 14A for the precedent transactions.
144
Okay, great.
145
There they are.
146
That's not a tool that an agent has access to.
147
I think we more and more see agents that have browser capabilities and so do that hypothetically.
148
That's a lot less efficient than just giving an agent access to a filing search tool where it can put in the ticker of a company, filter by a filing type and a date range, and then control F through those documents.
149
And so we both build the tools and then we teach the model how to use it.
150
And so for each different type of tool, we can have specialized models that query those documents more effectively, right?
151
They do the right keywords, or a specialized tool for formatting Excels.
152
And so we have to teach the models how to use these in a much lower latency, much higher accuracy way.
153
Yeah, I'm sure you're asked this all the time.
154, a common question for I feel any AI startup.
155, how do you think about the role of Rogo in using all these tools and accessing all these data sources that we talked about versus the role of an OpenAI, an Anthropic,, an XXAI that probably want access to many of the same data sources and maybe over time have the capability to do perform many of the same agenda tasks.
156
The better the next generation of models is, the better Rogo will be, right?
157
We can very quickly take those models and take that intelligence and have it build into our system almost immediately based on the way that we architect.
158
So it's great for us.
159
And the difference will be we are spending all of our time on financial tools and financial workflows.
160
And so when GPT-5 comes out and we already have access to all this tool data and how they're used most effectively and evals over how to do these financial workflows, we're going to be able to more quickly distill that into an end-to-end system that can generate a SIM, generate a PIB, analyze an S1 than they will.
161
And they'll have to collect those evals and create those tools over time.
162
And finance is a big enough market where they will likely start to focus on it.
163
But there's been more focus on generic consumer applications competing with the Microsoft Office suite, coding.
164
And I think finance is a domain where there's a lot more intricacy from the product layer and the workflow error than people expect.
165
And so I think we're going to have a distinct advantage for a while.
166
And ideally, by the point where they're turning their attention on finance, we have a lot of actual user data and evals and sense of what the workflows are such that we'll always be a step ahead.
167
Yeah, that seems to be the big debate, right?
168
Obviously, the word moat, we talk about so much in AI.
169
And it's constantly this question of, oh, do you want to be the model provider?
170
Do you want to be at the application layer?
171
And I think the logic that I hear often, and I frankly agree with, and it sounds it's similar to yours, it's, well, you need to specialize in something and you need to run really, really far ahead, right?
172
And as you said, unlock the proprietary data and lock in the different workflows that are going to be really, really hard for someone else who's very horizontal to specialize in.
173
Is that how you guys think about it?
174
Yeah, 100%.
175, I think more and more so the value is in the application layer.
176
Even if I look at my own usage of ChatGPT versus Gemini versus Claude, at this point, because I have a history of threads on ChatGPT, it responds in a more personalized way.
177
That's really helpful.
178
And I don't need to go in and explain to Gemini, hey, I'm Gabe Stengel.
179
I have a company called Rogo.
180
This is what we do.
181
Use that context to answer the question.
182
ChatGPT does a very good job of personalizing responses, reporting what I'm doing, having a good sense of the types of answers I.
183
And now it's a pain for me to switch.
184
Totally.
185
And that, even if the model is slightly worse,, I think that's an advantage of application and product layer.
186
At the model layer,, I'm not an expert on these models at all, but my sense is,, no one's ever going to be more than six months ahead of anyone else.
187
And so the distinct advantage you'll have as a model provider is just,, how low are your costs?
188
How reliable are your services?
189
How low latency is that?
190
That thing.
191
Let's go back a little bit.
192
So we talked about your role as an investment banker.
193
We talked about some of the early theses.
194
We talked about when you got started.
195
Take us back to that moment.
196
It sounds 2021, 2022.
197
Obviously, ChatGPT has just burst onto the seam the beginning of 2023.
198
What was it then starting this company and maybe even talking to investors and your first customers about what you were trying to do at a time where people had far less understanding about AI and the impending implications than they do now?
199
So we started the company before ChatGPT came out.
200
GPT-3 was out.
201
And so for those paying attention, it was obvious that this was a profound leap in technology.
202
But all the banks and hedge funds and private equity firms we spoke to, I think they thought.
203
this guy gave us full of snake oil, not this is going to change the way we work.
204
It was a long time until the market was receptive to what we were building.
205
And it was frankly also a long time until we figured out what exactly the market wanted too, right?
206
It's easy to say, great, let's make people smarter and more efficient with AI.
207
How does that manifest itself in a product?
208
What are the use cases?
209, how are people going to use it?
210
How important are these use cases versus those use cases?
211
How do you pitch it properly?
212
Who do you sell it to?
213
Those were all the things that we slowly had to learn over our first, let's call it 18, 24 months, where,, the market was not that receptive to us.
214
What were you promising them?
215, what would you say to your early customers?
216, there weren't that many early customers.
217
We didn't have real customers until 2023, late 2023.
218
And even then,,, you, as a founder, you're trying to get someone to use what you're building at all costs, right?
219
And so you'll do a whole song and dance just to get someone to be hands-on keyboard in your platform just for the product to break after 25 minutes.
220
The initial pitch was, hey, what if you could ask questions over your data and get answers in five seconds as opposed to using a clunky interface one of these old tools Bloomberg or the Edgar SEC filings database, or, pinging an analyst on your team?
221
And so that was the pitch, and it was pretty simple.
222
Yeah.
223
But it was hard to build and then hard to expect what folks were going to ask, right?
224
When you're pitching a generic search or chatbot, it means you have to build everything in on day one.
225
Otherwise, people are going to try the one thing you're expecting and then the five things you aren't, and the product is going to not suffice.
226
Right.
227
What about the early investor pitches?
228, what were you telling them and what resonated and what didn't?
229
Kevin Ryan, who led our Pre-C ground from a firm called AlleyCorp, based in New York, but Kevin himself is a self-proclaimed godfather of New York City tech, started MongoDB and Guild and Business Insider and was the CEO of DoubleClick.
230
He got it immediately.
231
But his function, his routing function, I don't think was AI is going to change the world.
232
I think his routing function was Gabe and John are two guys who are smart and understand technology and intimately understand investment banking.
233
And,, being from New York, I know investment banking is a domain that is ripe for disruption.
234
Did him from Mongo?
235
I knew him from growing up in New York.
236
So I had met his children a long time when I was going to school here.
237
And then I met him again at Mongo.
238
Yeah.
239
So I interned at Mongo and he came to speak and I would send him a few one-off messages.
240
And then he got in the routine of,, and to his credit as an investor, every six months, he would send me an email being, hey, what are you thinking about?
241
Do you still Lazard?
242, what are you doing next?
243
And so when I had this idea, well, at Lazar, he was the first person I messaged.
244
And it was a very natural start.
245
That's awesome.
246
Yeah, yeah.
247
That's that's really cool.
248
You talked early on about how early on it was it was tough to get customers to take this thing seriously.
249
You said you didn't really have any.
250
What was the moment in the product that flipped to product market fit and getting your first early sticky customers?
251
There were two core things.
252
One was changing our focus from just structured data to structured and unstructured data.
253
So from because the original product was econometrics, unstructured data, that's what we pitched, right?
254
It was, hey, make a chart of revenue multiples,, create a scatter plot of this versus that.
255
And we weren't taking advantage of what LLMs are best at and most magical with, which is unstructured data.
256
And we were too stubborn before,, opening the aperture.
257
The second thing was we just changed the way we were pitching the product.
258, I distinctly remember being on a call with a large private equity firm and it going,, the product demo going better than I'd seen a product demo going a while, in part because we'd added this unstructured data lens.
259
And they asked for pricing.
260
And I was, well, firms this big never asked for pricing.
261
They normally race to get off the call.
262
Right.
263
And so I have no sense of what to charge.
264
And so I took,, 10 seconds in my head and thought, okay,, I'm going to, let's push the full core advantage here.
265
$2 million a year, right?
266
Just pull a number out of thin air.
267
And they go, okay, makes sense.
268
And I, and as soon as I got off that call, I called my co-founder and I said, hey,, this firm didn't laugh at that number.
269
This, we might be on to something.
270, if someone hears $2 million a year and goes, oh, that,, that could make sense, it means you're pitching something that they think is very valuable.
271
And so it was those two moments in changing how we were pitching and what we were building that really started to unlock customer traction.
272
The unstructured data.
273, I think that makes sense.
274, you're seeing this on a lot of products right now where not just the use case of it and the value it provides to be able to just throw a bunch of stuff into the model and have it come back at you with something structured, but also just the time to you spend building an architecture and a database structure and the old way of doing it, I would say, the amount of time and cost that must that must save your startup is insane.
275
And we see this at a lot of startups.
276
Yeah.
277
No,, to query structured data well with an LLM, you still need a beautiful database that's documented well with data dictionaries.
278
To query unstructured data well,, you need some elastic search indices and a smart keyword search prompts and a big context window and just throw it in there.
279
Yeah, exactly.
280
When you're talking to this big firm and you're 2 million bucks, clearly that's a big contract, especially given your state.
281
It didn't end up being 2 million bucks.
282
But I'm glad it was tethered, anchored to that as a starting point.
283
For sure, for sure.
284, I'm guessing what,, what they start to think and customers at their scale must think is: okay, obviously,, this product has value such that we're considering paying for it, but it also better have things rock solid security, encryption, all this stuff that you associate with,, big, robust financial tools.
285
And at the time, you're a small startup.
286, you're investing in features and moving quickly.
287
How much are you thinking about that enterprise-grade stuff at the same time?
288
So we,, we were forced to think about it early on by the nature of our customer set, right?
289 we were forced to think about what it meant to be multi-cloud, what it meant to deploy on-prem, what it meant to have these enterprise-grade permissioning systems and R-backed systems and governance systems.
290
And so we had to do that much earlier than a startup would in typical life cycle.
291
And it slows you down, right?
292 it takes attention away from feature velocity and into enterprise stuff, but it's a prerequisite for us.
293
And I think it was also a mindset thing, right?
294 we didn't think of security as a side dish and the main dish being the product.
295
We thought of security as one of the main value propositions about what we were building.
296
And so if you treat it that,, you treat it the product, right?
297
And it's not, oh, we have to build out this enterprise permissioning system.
298
It's, oh, this is a feature.
299, this is something our clients want and it's just as part, just as much a part of our product market fit as the way that we respond to user questions is.
300
Yeah, got it.
301
Makes sense.
302
Did you have that capability on your team?
303, how do you go about solving for that?
304,, you figure CISO.
305
Yeah, tell us about it.
306
You figure it out.
307, it's all of these things.
308
You trial by fire.
309
Can you execute?
310
Bring in the expertise where necessary.
311
Otherwise, a lot of engineering problems, you can think about them from first principles and there's a lot of resources and you can work with your partners and stakeholders to solve them.
312
But it's interesting.
313 you said, it slows you down.
314
And the name of the game, it feels right now for all AI startups is speed.
315, we even talked about it early on.
316
In order for a company Rogo to succeed, you've got to race far enough ahead of the model providers before they decide that finance is a vertical they care about.
317
How do you balance that?
318
How do you move fast in a world where the cost of moving fast and making a mistake in your industry is really, really high?
319, we move slower than if we were a consumer company, for sure, from a feature perspective.
320 we just have to.
321, it's a a,, threading the needle constantly and thinking about trade-offs constantly and allocating as much bandwidth as you can to all your problems at the same time and just staying disciplined.
322
There's no,, there's no silver bullet for execution.
323
It's execution.
324
Yeah, totally.
325
It's tough.
326, it's crazy the pace of innovation and shipping you're seeing from startups right now.
327
And it seems it's just by necessity, right?
328
Yeah.
329
Well, and it's also thinking about: look, if I was a horizontal company, let's take a glean, you have different trade-offs.
330
And you say, hey, am I willing to build an on-prem version or a cloud-prem version or build in this security stuff?
331
Probably not because I'm racing more against ChatGPT and I'm going to be slower to these other verticals.
332
Whereas if you're a finance company and the race is to get into the largest financial institutions, well, focusing on security is the thing that allows you to move faster and get into customers' hands rather than the thing that's slowing you down.
333
And so it depends on what company you are.
334
And for us, it's all about the trade-off of,, is this functionality and enterprise great security a speed up in the near term and the long term?
335
Or is it something that's going to slow us down?
336
And I think for a company OpenAI, a lot of the security stuff is a slowdown, right?
337
Because they're not competing with us selling into large investment banks.
338
They're competing with,, Perplexity and Copilot and Anthropic to get to all consumers.
339
Yeah, totally.
340
So, okay, so now you've got a bunch of customers, you're post-PMF.
341
Walk us through maybe the day-to-day for some of your customers in terms of some use cases.
342 the people that sit in Rogo all day,, what are they doing today?
343
So I'll give you a great example, which is when I was an investment banking analyst and we were,, showing a bunch of great potential acquisitions to a large healthcare company.
344
You would have a list of 10 company profiles in slides and you would say, hey, look at this company, look at this biotech, look at this research company.
345
And you would say, this is their CEO.
346
This is what they focus on.
347
This is why it's strategic to you.
348
This is the,, what their snapshot financials look.
349
And that would take hours and hours and hours.
350
One, because,, if I'm, let's take some random biotech name, maybe I'm looking at a company Regeneron or Vertex.
351
I don't know what they do.
352
I'm an investment banking analyst.
353
I'm not,, an oncology expert.
354
And so it takes a while for you to read, synthesize, figure out what's in their RD pipeline and write it up.
355
In Rogo, you can say, hey, take these 10 companies, make 10 PowerPoint slide pages, and you can get an output in 30 seconds.
356
And so that saves a huge amount of time.
357
On the other end of the spectrum, not just junior bankers,, there's senior investors and bankers who go in and instead of having to ping an analyst on their team and say, hey, Gabe, I need a PIB on Datadog, they can just go into Rogo and say, hey, news run on Datadog.
358
Okay, cool.
359
What are they doing in this market?
360
Why are they down in that market?
361
What has their product focus been?
362
What's their MA strategy been?
363
And just have a thread where they get answers that they can work with immediately and dive deeper instead of asking for some deliverables just to help them prepare for a meeting.
364
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
365
The thing that people have been talking about across every industry, but also finance and capital allocation is,, is AI going to replace X?
366
What do you think of the role of a product Rogo in ultimately displacing human-powered work that it augments today?
367
It's going to replace workflows.
368
I don't think it's going to replace people.
369
Yeah.
370
In the same way that,, that workflow I described of creating a PIB for my managing director, 10 years before me,, you would create the pib and then you would go and print it out and bind it and go deliver it to your managing director's apartment at 11 p.m.
371
so that they could read it in the morning.
372
You're not doing the printout work.
373
You're not doing the binding.
374
You're not delivering it.
375
Right.
376
You're still working pretty hard.
377
You filled up your time with other things, right?
378 these are institutions that work hard.
379
They want to,, compete with each other.
380
They're not trying to rest on just healthier margins.
381
There's going to be more and more work.
382
That said, it's going to be different work, right?
383 you might not spend as much time data cubing and preparing presentations and, in the thick of an Excel, and you might spend more time thinking about a company or a problem.
384
You might spend more time meeting with stakeholders and founders and executives, forming those relationships.
385
One of the industries I see parallels and similarities to, I wonder if you do as well, is legal work and law firms.
386, one of the things we see and we hear about law firms, big law firms, the really big ones, is they're taking all of their data, their years and years of contracts and variables from within those contracts that they have unique proprietary insight into, and they're building their own models, right?
387
They're building their own tools.
388
They don't want to give that stuff up to an open AI or an Anthropic to build tools that ultimately displace them.
389
Are you seeing the same thing happening from big investment banks, the Lazards of the world?
390
Are they building their own tools?
391
Do you view them as competitors?
392
I think a lot of professional services organizations know what they're good at and have a sense for what they're not as good at.
393
And building really strong technology and AI models and products is not what has made an investment bank great.
394
It's the relationships, it's the business acumen, it's the ability to negotiate and get a great outcome for a client.
395
I think we're going to work with those sorts of banks to produce tools that mutually enrich us and make them more effective and help change their business models.
396
But I think it's much more of the partner scenario than the either build yourself or just buy an off-the-shelf tool.
397
And by the way, I think that's been core to some of the large legal AI companies as well.
398
If you speak to someone Winston at Harvey, a large part of his vision is working with law firms to produce products that they can jointly offer to customers.
399
Yeah, that makes a ton of sense.
400
Yeah, I imagine there's a tension, right?
401
And again, I see this with law firms.
402
I'm not even speaking to investment banks or Rogo, but it seems there's a tension when we go and we talk to lawyers at some of these big firms.
403
It's, oh, of course we know AI is coming, but we'd rather use our own tools and our own data rather than,, some startup or even again, one of the big models who is clearly specializing in this stuff.
404
There definitely will be a tension.
405, I think that folks in finance have not woken up to the reality that more and more of their day jobs are going to are going to be automated in the way that folks in legal have.
406
And so I think it's partly just going to be a mindset shift over the next coming years, five years.
407
And then I think the other reality is people, firms have not really seen job replacement yet, right?
408,, there haven't been big banks or big professional services organizations or big companies of any size,,, Apple or Disney or Microsoft who have really replaced jobs with AI yet.
409
And so I think until we start seeing that,, these firms are going to start continue functioning as business as usual, but maybe with slightly healthier margins or a slightly better product.
410
And when you start seeing the ability for AI to really automate human work, well, then these professional services organizations are going to have to take a step back and say, well, how does this change my business model?
411
And that's when I think we'll start to see the tension you're talking about.
412
Yeah, I totally agree.
413
And I think there's probably,, look i don't i don't know anything about running a law firm or an investment bank, but there's probably an opportunity right now where if you run ahead you can you can totally just, you can arm your staff with these superpowers.
414
And you said, get massive increases on your margins it almost make i don't know if i was running a law firm i'd probably do that right now yeah no i know it's not simple but there's also people who are starting to build law firms or banks but right from the bottoms up with technology there's a great company called offdeal started by a friend ori who was an investment banker and his idea is hey how do i start a the next goldman sachs just with technology And have fewer bankers so i think people are going to attack it from both ends from large incumbents who figure out how to digitize their workforce versus upstarts that figure out how to just build ai natively from day one but not as tech companies but as professional services organizations yeah and this is part of the trend you're seeing where vcs are are levering up and buying typical cash flow private equity businesses and then tech enabling them yeah these roll-ups yeah totally what do you think about looking ahead what do you think about the future of rogo how do the types and flavors of your customers start to change and evolve how do the use cases start to change and evolve right now it's investment bankers pee etc do you imagine a world which in the future it's anyone who's doing financial analysis finance departments of every flavor of company help us think through that yeah i i get asked about this internal corporate fpna stuff a lot my really maybe i will regret this when someday we're a huge company and we're we're eking out more tam in an investor day presentation but i'm not that interested in fp a departments at corporates right that's just that's less exciting to me helping it's more accounting workflows than it is,, thinking an investor would about what companies are exciting.
415
What are the great business models you want to invest in?
416
Who are the founders you want to back?
417
Or as a banker, what's the most strategic way for someone bob iger at Disney to think about capital allocation or acquisitions or the land or The market?
418
So it's more his corp dev team than his FPA.
419
Yeah, exactly.
420
Yeah.
421
But that said,, look, I, if when I look at the companies, I'm some companies I model us off of and most admire, admire, companies Bloomberg.
422
Bloomberg never said, okay, great,, we've had we have a good enough hold of the finance market.
423
Let's start selling to everyone.
424
They said, no, let's continue to innovate for this one buyer type in this one market that has almost a limitless ability to pay for tools that make them smarter and more effective, right?
425, I would always continue to invest in creating better and better tools for investors and bankers than try and veer off course, just because I think,, it's the one market on earth where there's an unconstrained ability to pay for something that makes you smarter.
426
You can go to a great hedge fund investor and say, hey, I'll make you a 20% better investor.
427
They will pay you whatever you want.
428
Whereas if I go to a corp dev or FPNA team and say, hey, I'll make your life a lot easier, there's a ceiling on what they're willing to pay, right?
429 they're not, they don't have unconstrained upside in their decision making.
430
Investors do.
431
Right, right.
432
Yeah, that's totally true.
433, imagine if I went to Lightspeed and I said, hey, I'll make you guys a 20% better investment firm.
434
How much would you guys pay for that?
435
Yeah.
436
Well, $3 million.
437
Yeah.
438
I imagine where you could probably see a ton of market expansion and maybe you're already doing this then is in consulting.
439
The McKinseys of the world, Accenture.
440, are you thinking about that?
441
Is that already part of what you do?
442
Yeah.
443
No, we already have a few consulting firms on the platform.
444
We have one of the big three who is rolling out the product, not just for their front office consultants, but for the,, the research teams they have internally, which is a funny thing to me because you would think that Rogo would replace the replace research teams that service consultants rather than be used by research teams to further help consultants.
445
But yeah, I think that professional services work is right, in the bullseye of what we can do.
446
Totally.
447
So when you go to sell this product into any of these organizations, professional services, investment banks, et cetera, do you think about it from a pure sales top-down motion?
448
Or is there something here where you can have a bit of a a PLG flywheel where one banker uses it and then shares the data with somebody else and that unlocks a new seat?
449
Help us think that.
450
I would love to have more of a PLG flywheel.
451
And it's funny, our new investors thrive.
452
There's an investor there, Vince, Vince Hanks, who's awesome and super smart and has always pushed me to have a PLG product.
453
Bankers, the domain is going to be blacklisted.
454
They have such strict infosec policies that if you could just go to app.rogo.ai and log in, you still wouldn't be able to do it.
455, you have to sell the hard way.
456
Things just can't be shown per second.
457
And I think that there's PLG possibilities on the buy side.
458
At a place Lightspeed, I'm sure people just go and use ChatGTM for personal devices.
459
And then the firm thinks, okay, great, we may as well get an enterprise account now because we don't really want people using personal devices.
460
But throughout financial services, it's a harder market to sell into from a PLG point of view.
461, you can use PLG or some product-led things as a way to generate top of funnel, but I don't think you're going to see the same type of sales motion that a Notion or an Airtable has where it just gets some bottoms up adoption and significant revenue traction, too.
462
And then you parlay it into enterprise.
463
I guess all those sharing and viral loops just get broken, right?
464
Even if you, even if you had a URL and you shared it in Slack, it just wouldn't even unfurl, it wouldn't show you any kind, you would just have to have the MD on your team would say, I can't open this, there's a firewall, right?
465
Exactly.
466
Yeah, that's got to be really hard.
467, and maybe again, going back to how you learned security, how did it, how did you, as a small team, learn sales?
468, how'd you guys do that?
469
Sales was a hard learning experience.
470
Really?
471
Yeah, tell us about it.
472
Oh, yeah.
473, I was computer science in undergrad.
474
I went worked as an investment banker.
475
I never met someone who worked in sales.
476, I just had never been surrounded by that archetype.
477
It's hard.
478
Enterprise sales is difficult.
479, it is not an easy thing that,, oh, sales is not that hard.
480
You just show the product, you get people signed up.
481
Selling to enterprise is there's 40 stakeholders.
482
They all care.
483
It's political.
484
You have to figure out what people want to hear.
485
What are the pain points?
486
How to thread the needle.
487
It's a difficult thing.
488, it was all learning.
489
We were lucky to hire some great, great folks early on who had experience selling into this market.
490
And that really expedited my learning and our success.
491
But it's not,, enterprise sales is not something to trivialize.
492
Yeah.
493
And because you don't have things PLG, you can't even employ this land and expand motion where some random person starts using it.
494
And then you go and you convince the CIO or whatever to buy it for the whole org.
495
I'm guessing you're literally just doing top-down sales, just banging on doors.
496
Yeah, more and more now we can sell five seats to an investment firm, and that's a little bit easier.
497
And then we go back,, in three months and say, hey, you have five seats, but these 20 other people have asked to get on too.
498
Why don't you just get an enterprise license?
499
So we see that more on the buy side.
500
For banks, yeah.
501
Yeah,, you're running pilot.
502
You have big stakeholder conversations, you need to prove out the ROI.
503
It is not the thing that can be PLG-led.
504
Yeah, totally makes sense.
505
So we talked a little bit about what you would and wouldn't do in the future in terms of potential customers and TAM expansion.
506
But maybe where do you see the company in five years, 10 years from now?
507
And maybe the banking industry more broadly as a result of AI?
508
I think that five years from now, 10 years from now, Rogo is going to be the most effective analyst on Wall Street.
509, I think it will be very hard to run an investment firm or a bank if you don't employ Rogo, right?
510
If you don't literally have an army of Rogo analysts helping you be smarter and more effective.
511
You won't be able to submit a bid in the first round of a transaction fast enough because you won't have this army of AI analysts doing diligence.
512
You won't be able to win The best one bake-off because you'll be a little bit less sophisticated in how you pitch to clients without a tool Rogo.
513
It'll be every firm's smartest, most productive analyst.
514
The flip side of that is we will also be able to offer financial services to types of companies that beforehand didn't get those types of financial services, right?
515 giving MA advice, running fundraising processes, that's a type of high finance financial service, right?
516
We don't think of it that way because it's not a checking account that you can get through QIIME or a financial service being able to buy and sell your own stocks through something Robinhood.
517
But these are still important financial services that a lot of companies don't have access to.
518
If you have a $20 million EV HVAC business, who's running your sell-side process?
519
No one.
520
So you're getting a 20% worse price when you sell it to some private equity-backed roll-up.
521
If we have the technology to help folks do that, I'd love to directly offer it and help make private markets more efficient and help democratize some of these high-finance financial services that not everyone has access to today because you can't pay Goldman Sachs $5 million to run the process or give you advice or help you fundraise.
522
That's super interesting.
523
So, yeah,, we talked earlier about, you don't want to get into FPA, but I think we were talking about Disney and Bob Iger, and we're, oh, his corp dev team, could you use this?
524
When you look at it through that lens, I think to your point,, this is something startups could use, small businesses, small, medium-sized businesses, again, to get access to the types of services they might only get access to if they're a really big company and have internally, or they're hiring somebody Lazard.
525
Is that what you mean?
526
Yeah, well,, look, if you're Bob Iger and you're thinking about maybe you're selling the company to Apple and you're thinking about who should I hire as my investment bank?
527
Should I hire Lazard or Goldman or whoever?
528
What if you don't need to hire a banker to produce a fairness opinion, right?
529 what if you don't need to pay $25 million to do that?
530
Or what if you can use,, let's say Lazard has an AI product that can help generate fairness opinions and it's at a quarter of the price and double the quality.
531
Could you just use that?
532
And so there are types of financial services where I think firms will be able to go direct with technology.
533
And then there's others that you can't, right?
534 if you're brokering a transaction and it takes a human in the loop and you want to shake someone's hand and you want to trust who you're partnering with and negotiating with, that's when a banker is going to be invaluable, especially a banker with a Rolodex and one that knows your business and your industry and all the counterparties.
535
Makes total sense.
536
Gabe, this has been fascinating.
537
I really, really appreciate all the time you spent with us.
538
And yeah, wishing you and Rogo all the best of luck.
539
And we should do this again sometime.
540
Mike, appreciate it.
