--- METADATA END ---

1
I get on a call with a customer, Gong already prepares me for the meeting.
2
The way it used to work, you know, I'd get like five people from the account, we'll schedule like a pre-meeting briefing, they prepare a document with all the questions, and it's probably like five hours of some highly paid people.
3
Now it's 30 seconds, right?
4
It just means to read if I have a question, I ask.
5
So it's a huge, huge time saver.
6
And, you know, we're not even yet at like level five driving.
7
So the potential is like way bigger.
8
Remember, like 75% of sellers' time is not customer-facing.
9
That's the data.
10
Everything else is the opportunity size.
11
Hi, and welcome to Training Data.
12
Today, we're excited to welcome Amit Bendov, CEO and founder of Gong, which is one of the most beloved companies in the modern-day sales world and also one of the very first AI-native application companies.
13
We interviewed Amit about Gong's evolution from a wedge into a platform, specifically from a transcription tool into a broader revenue intelligence platform, and heard more from Amit on his prediction for what the sales team of the future might look like and Gong's role in building that future.
14
Enjoy the show.
15
Amit, thank you so much for joining us today.
16
We are delighted to have you on the show.
17
You are one of the OG AI applications and absolutely beloved company in the sales world.
18
And so looking forward to having you on Training Data.
19
I'm excited to be here.
20
Let's jump right in.
21
I want to start with one of the hot topics in the AI sales world right now, which is, do you believe that AI is going to take over the role of the SDR?
22
Completely, no, not in the near future, not with the current technology.
23
I do think that a lot of the BDS is a very good idea.
24
So it's not binary, but short answer: not in the next few years, definitely not if it's a complex, outbound SDRs.
25
AI is not going to be able to totally replace that.
26
Got it.
27
Okay, follow-up question.
28
Do you think that CRM will exist in five years' time?
29
In a future where we have a lot of agents running around doing a lot of sales-related activity, what is the role of the CRM in that future?
30
Yeah, I'm sure CRM will exist in 20 years.
31
Like, it's not going away.
32
There's so much built in there, just like you know, mainframes are still there, even though there's like much better technology.
33
I don't believe that in managing customers, CRM is going to be at the epicenter.
34
We're moving from a CRM-centric world to a more like AI-centric world.
35
CRM manages customers, their data, and a lot of other things, but it's not managing the operations, the activities, and how to engage customers.
36
So, that's for sure.
37
It's still there.
38
People tend to underestimate how much there is in CRM.
39
There's quite a bit, and it definitely will live for a while.
40
Amit, in that AI-centric world, what is the role of the software?
41
What is the role of the humans?
42
The role of the software we're trying, we're starting to understand the role of the human is actually less clear, and I think we will be surprised.
43
It's hard to predict what it will be.
44
I'm sure it'll change.
45
Roles, there are roles today.
46
You know, prompt engineer is the obvious one, right, that we couldn't even imagine like three years ago.
47
SDR did not exist.
48
People asked, it did not exist 30 years ago.
49
You know, I would say in general, the current technology, anything that's based on Transformer is fit for certain types of work.
50
It cannot replace humans whenever there's like accountability or decision-making or creativity.
51
We're not even close to that.
52
So humans will still be in control, I believe, for a while, but AI can do a lot of the work.
53
So, you know, definitely AI could do an amazing job reviewing a contract right now, redlining all the hot topics, even suggesting correction, right?
54
We would not let AI sign a contract or even send a contract or send a proposal, right?
55
There's always like a lawyer that will need to do that.
56
So I think the roles will shift to humans that are augmented and using AI as a tool for quite a few tasks.
57
In our industry specific, there is this number that goes around that 75% of what sellers are doing is non-selling activity.
58
So three out of four dollars that we're paying them is to do admin and non-essential work.
59
All of that could be replaced by AI.
60
That'll be pretty exciting.
61
Amit, take us back to 2015 when you founded Gong.
62
Meeting transcription.
63
Like, why did you start with that?
64
And was the vision always to build a meeting transcription tool or to build something very different from that?
65
No, actually, the vision was never about transcription.
66
So when I started a company, we were like at my previous company, before starting Gong, we were recording calls and I was using a transcription service.
67
Like, there's like there's so many of them going on.
68
Who has the time to do it?
69
I have a little bit of an ADD as well, so I'm not the person to either listen at great lengths or read.
70
So, I wanted something that would take all the information and translate it in structured data.
71
And transcription is just a way in a process in the pipeline that you need to capture the audio and video, transcribe, then identify topics and themes and other things, and then use it in structured data.
72
So, that was the idea.
73
We started with meetings because that was kind of the big black hole.
74
We could kind of see other things that are happening and activity, but this is like very rich data set that we knew nothing about, and nobody was doing anything.
75
So, that's why we started with that.
76
Amid, I remember in those early days, there's this period of time where Gong was one of many, and then it felt from the outside looking in, it felt almost overnight.
77
All of a sudden, Gong was one of one.
78
What did you guys get so right in those early days?
79
I actually think we have like more competition right now, and I always tell the team that the more successful we are, we're going to have more.
80
So, if you look at when we started, we thought that we were alone because there are other companies in sales.
81
We didn't know about it.
82
Thank God we didn't know.
83
But we found that there are like two others.
84
Now, there are dozens of companies, and I hope to have like hundreds in a few years.
85
Like, if you look at how many companies are in CRM, there are hundreds.
86
So, if the market grows, there's an opportunity but that's that's a very important uh question there's never like a moment there are always moments where uh people predicted our death or doom or whatever so um 20 I think 2017 or something.
87
So we didn't know that we have competition.
88
Like I started gone because I said, oh, like I have this problem.
89
I'm scratching my own itch.
90
Nothing exists.
91
Maybe we should start a company.
92
And then I found there's another company that was like better funded, like a little bit ahead of us, you know, maybe like cooler technology.
93
And when I realized that, I still have the recording from our own hands.
94
We were like a very small company at the time.
95
But so I'm like, by the end of this year, there's only one goal that matters.
96
We're going to be number one or nothing else matters.
97
Like I'm not interested in this company if we're not number one, clear leader.
98
So like in SaaS, there is no second prize, at least nothing that I'm interested in.
99
And we have to be in.
100
We decide, define metrics.
101
First, how much we're going to win.
102
And second, it's not us.
103
We're going to be the undisputed leader.
104
So we even put metrics like how much MediaShare or LinkedIn or social media share.
105
And we wanted to have with 2x all the others combined.
106
That was the goal, right?
107
And we hit it.
108
And first, the gaps, first, it's like very neck to neck.
109
Then you get a little win.
110
It's very hard.
111
And I think we started a little behind.
112
But the strong gets stronger.
113
Once you start opening a gap of like, you know, let's say 5%, 10%, it becomes easier.
114
The salespeople become more confident.
115
Customers start to see.
116
And then the gap widens.
117
And then you get new competitors.
118
So we started.
119
Then people said, okay, like Outreach and SalesLoft are going to eat you.
120
Before we raised money, it said Google and Amazon are going to eat you.
121
So there's always competition, but you absolutely have to win.
122
It's very hard at first.
123
But once you start opening the gap, it gets easier.
124
And then you get new competitors.
125
So you're never alone.
126
If you're alone, you're in trouble.
127
You're in the wrong market.
128
I mean, my view as the person on the sidelines who was doing the investment memo work at the time was the thing that you all did that was really special was you won the hearts and minds of your customer and you were really really customer focused.
129
And this is, at the time, meaning transcription was kind of new-ish.
130
A lot of the models weren't that side of the art yet.
131
And so a lot of the other companies were thinking technology out and you were really going customer back and you knew how to win over those hearts and minds.
132
And I think to this day, that is the thing that is so special about Gong.
133
You go talk to any sales or app sales team, it's like it's gong, gong, gong.
134
And they get googly eyes when they think about you.
135
Absolutely.
136
That's a great point, Sonia.
137
Thank you.
138
It's not that, yeah, the fact that you want to win doesn't win the battle, right?
139
You have to do it the right way.
140
And we're always looking at customer problems that we can solve better than anyone else, right?
141
And always looking ahead.
142
And our goal is always to be almost like every two years to be a new company.
143
I'm a big Beatles fan.
144
Sorry, that's my age.
145
And I told the team, I always tell them that I want to be like.
146
So if all we do like medium recording today, we'd be dead.
147
Because, oh, that's like everybody can do that.
148
So we always have to reinvent, take great care of customers.
149
And people think the competition is like a zero-sum game, almost like a football, like bowl possession and all of that.
150
It's more like an Easter egg hunt, right?
151
If you see, don't go to where all the other kids are running.
152
Just find the ones that are your own that nobody's seeing and get as many of them as you can.
153
I just watched my toddler try to do his first Easter egg hunt.
154
He did not find very many of those.
155
So when you started the company, you know, this was a pre-open AI or pre-Chat GPT era at least, and there weren't really great foundation models to build upon.
156
And so I remember back when we invested, you know, you had a very state-of-the-art kind of model research lab in Israel that was doing a lot of speech-to-text and model technology.
157
To what extent was that a source of competitive advantage for you then?
158
And is it still a source of competitive advantage for you today?
159
Great question.
160
So we went back and forth on this, I think, like two or three times.
161
I'm still not sure we've seen the last chapter in this.
162
So when we started, we did not have our transcription engine.
163
We were using just like a web API.
164
I was at the opinion that we should have one.
165
It's so core to what we do.
166
But Elon, my co-founder, the smarter half, said, no, like it's only like $6 million.
167
I don't want to invest in something like, you know, 3% more accuracy.
168
Let's see what people want to buy first, develop the app, and then once we raise more money, we develop.
169
So we started with something that's really not.
170
And we saw what was important.
171
Our competitors were investing a lot in like real-time transcription and all the cool technology that never made like a real difference for customers.
172
So, I'm glad in hindsight that I listened to Elon and we didn't burn our Sirius A money on a transcription engine.
173
But then, once we started, you're right, at that time, we had to rely on things like nuance, right, which was like very expensive, and people don't even know what it is today, but and not great.
174
So, we decided to now we can invest.
175
We started our own team, we hired some of the best speech people in Israel, and there are quite a few of them, and develop our own.
176
And it was like better quality and a lot cheaper.
177
So, that was a competitive advantage.
178
And now, we used anything from some of the Amazon services and Whisper for some of the things.
179
We still have our own models for some languages where the others don't do a good enough job.
180
But if they do, we'll be happy to switch to a service.
181
Like, our transcription is not our core competency.
182
We're very good at this, but we're at the AI application layer.
183
This is very low level that we do it.
184
It's like a car battery, right?
185
If we can't find something, we'll develop it.
186
But if we can find something better and cheaper, we'll use it.
187
I'm glad you brought up real-time transcription because that was one of those, I remember, you know, from the technology out, that was when we.
188
And so, even though that may be the cooler technology, like, this is like what our customer wants is, you know, actually coaching workflows and the ability to analyze competitor mentions after the fact.
189
And so, like, that I think is a great example of thinking customer back versus technology out.
190
Yes, yes, absolutely.
191
We have, like, since we started every time, we're always asked about real-time, which is like, you know, it makes like total sense, right?
192
Except that the technology doesn't really work to this day, and the value is questionable, right?
193
So we still have not seen it in action, like in a great way.
194
I want to talk about generative AI.
195
And so you started this company back in the days of what I would call predictive or analytical AI.
196
And a lot of the value is in that.
197
How many times are your competitors being mentioned?
198
If you talk about this feature first, do your win rates go up?
199
And I think a lot of the value is in that.
200
Tell me about what you see as the opportunity for Gong in a kind of generative AI technology era.
201
Well, I mean, these are exciting days.
202
And when we started a company in 2016, even 2015, I'm starting to think about it.
203
The model that we used is a self-driving car, right?
204
Autonomous system.
205
And self-driving car of like five levels.
206
Level five being like fully self-driving, and level one is kind of like alerts of sorts, right?
207
And we envision an autonomous application that runs a revenue organization that you tell what my revenue goals is, and I need to understand how to break it down to goals and how to help from the leaders to the individual.
208
It still doesn't fully exist.
209
There are still components that are missing.
210
But every time we're able to, every time we assess what's real today, what's available, what's the state of the art, not the hype, what we can really do reliably and create a great customer experience that we can stand behind and integrate into our solution.
211
And generative AI was a game changer.
212
Things like summarizing calls is something that we wanted to do in 2016.
213
I actually hired a news editor, a TV news editor, and I wanted to see, because we wanted to take, okay, take like 60 minutes and create a 30-second newsreel like you do on TV or sports, right?
214
And I paid someone, I gave a recording, said, okay, why don't you create something for me?
215
And we did probably like 20, 20 attempts, and I gave up because they're not good.
216
And you understand that actually summarizing, it's already biased in some way.
217
So now you could do it like super easy.
218
So it creates like a ton of value.
219
Some of the holy grail apps that people ask for, you know, tell me what's going on in this account.
220
So now I could just ask, like, we're at the end of our quarter right now.
221
So I could log in and just say, hey, like, how is this deal progressing?
222
Like, what could make it go wrong?
223
Like, can I help with anything?
224
And I'll tell you, it's pretty amazing.
225
On the market side, but what it did in market awareness.
226
So when we started, Gong is an AI company or an AI application company more precisely.
227
But we never spoke about it.
228
Like it was like third-level messaging that this is like AI technology because it would scare the heck out of people.
229
So especially we sell to non-technical people.
230
We sell to CROs and business users that aren't super technical.
231
So if you talk about AI, that seems like scary in science fiction.
232
So it was like third-level messaging.
233
You had to double-click like at least a couple times.
234
But now we get a lot of people calling us.
235
Hey, my CEO was asked on an earning call if they plan to increase or how are they going to plan to increase sales productivity with AI?
236
Do you have something with AI?
237
So the openness and the excitement in ChatGPT made it so accessible at a consumer level that that's super exciting.
238
On that note, I think a lot of companies' boards are focused top down on how AI is changing productivity metrics.
239
And I think in coding, for example, it's been pretty exciting to see a lot of companies are now reporting 20 to 30 percent increases in engineering velocity and metrics like that.
240
What have you seen on the sales side?
241
What has been the impact of using AI for your customers and in the revenue orgs?
242
We've seen dramatic changes.
243
So some of our customers have seen as much like 60% more sales capacity.
244
Let's say, you know, a person can handle 50 accounts, now they can do 100 accounts, right?
245
So that's like just by saving all the time.
246
So a lot of the tasks are just becoming redundant, even like you don't need to talk to as many people anymore.
247
There's the fun part of talking to other people, but not like what happened, what I'm going to do, because now everything is visible.
248
I get on a call with a customer, Gong already prepares me for the meeting.
249
So I don't need to call the account team usually.
250
The way it used to work, I'd get like five people from the account, we'll schedule like a pre-meeting briefing, they prepare a document with all the questions, and it's probably like five hours of some highly paid people.
251
Now it's 30 seconds, right?
252
It just means to read if I have a question, I ask.
253
So it's a huge time saver.
254
And, you know, we're not even yet at like level five driving.
255
So the potential is like way bigger.
256
If you remember, like 75% of sellers' time is not customer-facing.
257
That's the data.
258
Everything else is the opportunity size.
259
What level are we at today?
260
And what's the path to getting to level five?
261
It depends.
262
So there are different components.
263
Like, for example, at Gong, so some are at level two and some are level three and some are at level four.
264
Level four is almost like driving.
265
So if I, you know, let's say I get on a call with a customer, Gong would also create like the email for me, but I have to click send.
266
So this is like level four.
267
It's almost like I'm in control, which is smart.
268
That's level four.
269
Level five is when it'll send the email on my behalf.
270
It'll take a little bit of time.
271
Some things are easier than others, and some things are not as mission critical, right?
272
If you want to do, people, everybody talk about like outbound SDRs, right?
273
Cold calling.
274
This is a pretty poor choice for the current state of AR because first it's hard.
275
It's very hard for people to do it.
276
Second, if it goes wrong, it's very damaging to your brand.
277
As we've seen, if you've seen some of the cursor service agent changing privacy policy or airlines, so I wouldn't let AI talk to my customers, except for very simple cases like support tickets that are pretty confined and but not anything that is complex.
278
So for those, it's still going to be level four until we get conviction that the technology can be 100% trusted.
279
But some areas are, you know, if it's not, for example, now we have like role-playing, right?
280
AI, you could just practice, do practice call with AI and it'll give you feedback.
281
If this thing doesn't work 100%, it's no big deal.
282
Like, yeah, like a little bit annoying, but you're not embarrassed in front of customers.
283
Is that with like a virtual avatar?
284
Yes, yes, yes.
285
Oh, super cool.
286
Yes.
287
So the comment on until it's 100% trusted, do you think people, or I guess in terms of what you've observed with your customers and the users of the product, do people hold AI to a higher standard than they hold themselves?
288
I would guess most of those reps or BDRs or SDRs are not 100% all the time.
289
Yes and no.
290
So the yes, actually, fun fact, like when we started Gong, we actually did not show the transcription.
291
So you couldn't see the transcription was there, but someone advised us, like a smart person that did it like another application, don't show the transcript because it's 70% accurate, which means like three out of ten words will be wrong.
292
When someone reads that, it'll just be an awful user experience.
293
So we hit it.
294
We allow them to search.
295
We show some things, and now people are super happy.
296
But we couldn't show the thing because it just wasn't good.
297
So people do expect perfection with AI.
298
You know, someone, a self-driving Tesla makes an accident, right?
299
It's major headlines, right?
300
But, you know, people make so many more accidents, like, and nobody talks about.
301
That said, I do see that the reactions to, for example, when people ask questions at Gong or they get the summaries or they get, everybody's very excited.
302
They know it's not perfect.
303
Like it's, you know, maybe 80, 85% correct.
304
But the value, because it's so fast, right?
305
And so easy.
306
I don't see a lot of people complaining.
307
So I think people are able to tolerate somewhat lower quality for ease of use.
308
So for example, when I was a teenager, right, we had like hi-fi systems, right?
309
That's how you listen to music.
310
And people, like either like on headphones or like on mono, just one speaker, right?
311
How can you listen to that?
312
Just poor audio quality, right?
313
But it's so.
314
And this is like definitely a lot simpler.
315
So we see a lot of generally the sentiment is very positive.
316
I have no idea what a hi-fi system is.
317
Yes.
318
I bought, my wife wanted to kill me, but I bought like major speakers in our basement and she said, you did what?
319
Yeah.
320
But it's that audio quality.
321
Love it.
322
Amit, what's your take on agents?
323
And how are you guys approaching agents building, selling agents at COM?
324
We think agents are real.
325
They're, again, like a lot of other things, there's a bit like inflated expectations right now.
326
It's like it's going to do everything.
327
So everybody, agents aren't taking your job anytime soon.
328
But they can definitely take parts of your job, the parts that you don't like doing, and it's a waste of your time.
329
So the approach that we're taking is like task-specific agents.
330
They're not developed like do anything or there's no writing code.
331
So we have, for example, like we spoke about like briefer, right?
332
So here's like brief me for Encounter.
333
So there's an agent that trained for this task.
334
It has parameters and it's built in the workflow.
335
So that's, and we have dozens of them.
336
That's the approach that we believe are great for enterprise applications.
337
General purpose are very hard to nail because they could go in all sorts of directions.
338
But it's a real thing.
339
It's also interesting, the line between simple automation and agents isn't clear if you look at it.
340
Some of them, like, it's some of the question: can they make decisions?
341
Again, for non-critical decisions, decisions that aren't like a huge deal, they can definitely do a great job.
342
But agents can definitely do quite a bit of our work.
343
Have the newer model capabilities, and in particular, the reasoning models, have those unlocked new capabilities for GOM?
344
Not yet.
345
I think that there's a line that I'm not sure that even transformer technologies is capable of, which is like, can you rely 100% of something that will be true, right?
346
Just truthfulness, like not 99%, 100%.
347
So, there is a category of work that has to be, you know, you send a proposal to a customer.
348
That can't be like 99%, right?
349
If it's like 1% of the cases, then you send something that's like totally wrong pricing or over-discounting or something is like a hallucination.
350
So, even with the reasoning, it's getting better.
351
So, I think it increases the classes of tasks that make sense.
352
But if you talk like AGI or things that are absolutely like must happen, you know, calculate commissions to sellers, right?
353
You get it wrong, it's very bad, right?
354
So, I think it's a quantitative improvement, still not a qualitative.
355
Qualitative, that's 100% trusty.
356
And that would be, some would say, even if it's like, you know, Jan Lacun or David Deutsch, they'll say like it's not even with the realm of transformer technology because of.
357
Do you agree with Jan's take?
358
Yes.
359
But I also know there's a possibility that maybe like, and he's like much smarter than I am, that we're not seeing that someone would prove us wrong, which would be great.
360
But yeah, right now there's also an issue of accountability and both legal, but also from a work perspective.
361
For example, Gone now has the ability to update all opportunity records, for example.
362
So that's a no-brainer, right?
363
Nobody needs to log into CRM and update fields anymore.
364
Some companies still want the seller to say yes, yes, yes, yes, because otherwise they can blame AI for, oh, I didn't say that.
365
It's like AI, and AI could be wrong.
366
It's like the risk of error.
367
So there's a difference in an analog computer and a digital computer.
368
Digital computer has error correction, which means you know if a message was sent over a line, there's errors, it'll get there exactly as it is, right?
369
And Transformer, maybe it'll be enhanced in a way that we're not thinking about.
370
It'll take like different kinds of technology to get there.
371
My two cents.
372
Yeah.
373
What do you think the sales team of the future is going to look like?
374
And maybe you don't have a high-fidelity point of view on that, but how quickly do you think the composition, the team composition of the sales team is going to change?
375
If you take the software engineering world as an analogy, I think that's changing rapidly in terms of size of software engineering teams, skill sets.
376
How quickly do you think the sales world is going to change?
377
It's already changing.
378
I think that it'll be gradual.
379
So there are seems that very transactional sales, for example, but I want to buy an iPhone or something.
380
They'll go first because that could certainly be automated.
381
Or I want to upgrade my seller plan or whatever it is.
382
That can be handled.
383
Complex things like I want to buy a house or a mortgage or enterprise software, that's more complicated.
384
But I do not see people doing clerical work, right?
385
Just updating forms.
386
I do not see the traditional forecasting.
387
I do think that there are things that are some very far-reaching consequences.
388
Right now, people are doing manual forecasting, right?
389
I don't think that's necessary because software and AI can do a way better job.
390
All things, you know, companies have sales stages in the process.
391
Every company has, you know, their five or six stages.
392
You don't really need that.
393
That's a management tool that was created like 50 years ago so we can get some visibility to where the process is.
394
But actually, everything can be done way smarter with AI.
395
So I think the process can change, the people can change.
396
People would, we see great adoption of the technology because, again, it's so easy that it's cross-generational right now.
397
That people are very eager, and sometimes their imagination is even faster than our speed of development.
398
I'm not sure that it'll be around, not necessarily because the software is going to replace, but sellers could do their own thing, right, if they have the right tools.
399
So fewer people could do more work.
400
Remember, BDR did not exist 30 years ago.
401
It was created for fast, hyper-growth, fast companies.
402
Most companies in the world don't have that.
403
So I think we're going to augment the sellers and they'll be able to address a lot more customers.
404
I mean, it's easy to imagine that sales team of the future being smaller on balance than the sales teams of the present.
405
Each individual is far more productive because of wonderful tools like Gong that give them superpowers.
406
The thing I'm curious about is for you as a business, you create a lot of value with the product that you offer.
407
You capture that value today, I believe primarily through a seat-based pricing model.
408
If there's this countervailing force on seats, which is, ironically, you're making people more productive, therefore they need fewer seats.
409
Over time, how does your pricing and packaging evolve?
410
How do you capture more of that value that you're creating if seats aren't going up as fast as they might have historically?
411
I love the question, Pat.
412
So there are multiple forces.
413
First, I'm not sure there'll be fewer sellers.
414
They'll be different, but the economy grows.
415
Kind of GDP grows over time.
416
There'll be products and services we're not imagining right now that will be there.
417
So it's not necessarily like fewer people, but people will be more efficient.
418
But we will start to add the consumption level or usage pricing.
419
Like this year, we're coming with an orchestration product that will be a great fit.
420
When we started Gong, actually, we asked people, Do you want to do it based on usage or based on seats?
421
And most people that we serve with, most buyers said, oh, per seat, right?
422
You know, because they use like CRM as an anchor point, right?
423
And we didn't want to innovate on too many fronts.
424
So we said, okay, we innovated a product, pricing, we'll keep it like simple.
425
But we always, and probably in the pitch deck, like from Siri or whenever we did, we said, like, this will be, AI will be bigger than cloud, right?
426
Because cloud is an IT revolution and AI is a work revolution.
427
So we never saw ourselves as a software company, but more like a BPO.
428
And the potential is 10 times bigger.
429
Because if you take, you know, most sales tax, like, you know, $1,000 a seat, and I think it could easily be like, you know, $1,000 or more per month.
430
Because if you think of how many, you know, people are making $200,000 or costing $200,000 a year, you save 70%, that's $140,000, right?
431
You take 10% of that.
432
It's still a bargain for the CFO and the company.
433
So the potential is absolutely there, whether it's like usage-based or just higher per seat pricing, it has to be aligned with the value.
434
But I think the world is more ready now to look at value pricing.
435
I'm going to do a quick aside from AI for a second because I think that Gong is one of the only companies that's really re-inflected revenue growth at pretty meaningful scale.
436
Talk to us about what it was like going through sales tech winter over the last several years and then how you made it through to the other side and any lessons from other founders.
437
Do we really want to get into that, Sonia?
438
Like it was like, so early 2023, you're really facing a tough, tough headwind, right?
439
The market was tanking.
440
It was like this perfect storm, everything, and we almost came to a halt.
441
Very challenging and demoralizing to the team.
442
And, you know, when it says customers, they say, we love you, but we're leaving, or some companies are going out of business.
443
So it was tough, but I never lost conviction that we can turn this around.
444
And we started rolling our sleeves and got to work.
445
So we launched two new products, Forecast and Engage, like in great speed.
446
Fortunately, we had enough money.
447
So we raised a lot of money.
448
We never burnt a lot of money.
449
So when we always need, people ask, why are you raising?
450
This is like for a rainy day that we didn't know when it's going to come, but we knew it will.
451
So we decided that where everybody were laying off people, we said this is an opportunity for us.
452
It'll be harder for the competition.
453
Now we're going to keep the food on a gas pedal.
454
That's one.
455
Second, we improved our act.
456
When we sell, we had to create a bulletproof business case that a CFO would approve.
457
It's not just that, you know, buy Gong because it's cool and it'll change your life.
458
So it has to show real value, how we support customers.
459
And we tried a lot of things, and you don't see immediate impact.
460
Some of the things that you're doing, it might take like two or three quarters.
461
So you're experimenting with quite a few things, and nothing seems to be working.
462
So it's a very challenging situation.
463
But the team was able to turn it around.
464
So all these things, eventually, the product, beefing up the product suite, improving our game.
465
And fortunately, ChatGPT came out and it gave us a huge boost.
466
There are a lot of people who spelled like the death of Gong.
467
Oh, now everybody can do generated value will make everything possible.
468
That was slightly exaggerated.
469
But that actually gave us a really nice tailwind because customers saw a lot more value in the solution.
470
So all these things together helped us turn it around.
471
And now we're accelerating.
472
I don't know when this will be aired, but even this quarter is even faster than the previous quarter, Sony.
473
I'll give you like a look.
474
Yeah, yeah.
475
So we had, it's now seven consecutive quarters of accelerating, and we hope we have not seen the end.
476
I mean, I think your grit and the way that you dug in and just led the company through that period and never lost any confidence whatsoever in the full vision for what Gong could become.
477
I think it's, I have huge respect and admiration, we all do, for how you weathered that storm.
478
And I think you've now earned the right to really go big and go pursue that big ambition.
479
Should we close it out with some rapid-fire questions?
480
Oh, I'm nervous.
481
But yeah, bring it on.
482
Okay, these are intended to be like one word or one sentence answers.
483
Whatever comes to mind quickly.
484
Okay, favorite new AI application in your personal life or at work other than Gong?
485
Chat GPD, easily.
486
I use it like 15 times a day easily.
487
Yeah.
488
Yeah.
489
For everything.
490
I don't want to tell you for what, but yeah.
491
All right.
492
How about one piece of advice for founders who are building AI companies at the application layer?
493
Keep your eyes on the customer.
494
Talk to customers.
495
Don't believe your investors, the influencers, all of that.
496
I love you all.
497
Just talk to customers, see what they really need.
498
Be the fastest thing that works now.
499
Not like in two years where the hype is just follow, keep your eyes on the ball.
500
Love it.
501
I don't love that so much.
502
I'm kidding.
503
It goes rapid.
504
If you give me a little more time, maybe I'll give it more political role.
505
I'm completely kidding.
506
In two or three years' time, will we have virtual avatars actually selling to customers directly?
507
Yes or no?
508
Yes, yes, yes.
509
I think for simple products, yeah, that's definitely a possibility.
510
How about one recommended piece of content for people who are interested in AI?
511
Something they should read or listen to?
512
Just, you know, just following your interest.
513
I'm not loyal to any one source.
514
I listen to all this kind of things.
515
I just put my interest on YouTube, and that's how I find the information and look at it.
516
I do like The Beginning of Infinity by David Deutsch.
517
It's not the easiest read, but this book is not just on AI, but it talks.
518
And this is like a mind-changing book in my mind.
519
I mean, do you think AI is capable of fully autonomously signing a million-dollar contract?
520
And what year will that happen?
521
Not in the next three to five years, in my opinion.
522
It'll need something that's beyond transformers, something that is not like an analog computer, it's more digital, that can be relied 100%.
523
And I don't know what it is, and I don't know that anyone knows today what it is, but it'll take like a different level of technology.
524
This is recorded, so let's put something on a calendar for like three to five years and see if I was wrong or right.
525
Let's do it.
526
I think you've tended to be right whenever we've disagreed in the past, Meet.
527
Thank you so much for joining us today.
528
We really enjoyed the discussion, and congratulations on persevering through SalesTech Winter and making it through to this very exciting time for AI and for the world.
529
Well, it was fun.
530
Thank you so much.
