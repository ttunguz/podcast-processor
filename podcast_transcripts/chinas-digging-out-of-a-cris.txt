1
Today, I'm speaking with Ken Rogoff, who is a professor at Harvard, author recently of Our Dollar, Your Problem, former chief economist at the IMF.
2
Ken, thanks so much for coming on the podcast.
3
Thanks so much for having me, and welcome to Harvard, which is where we're filming this.
4
In your book, you have a lot of anecdotes of meeting different Chinese leaders, especially when you're chief economists of the IMF.
5
And it seems you had positive experiences.
6
They would listen, you met the premier with your family, and he would listen to your advice.
7
So, one, how does that inform your view about how competent their leadership is?
8
And two, how do you think they got into this mess with their big stimulus or whatever else you think went wrong?
9
To the extent that when you were talking to them in the early 2000s, it seemed you were seeing eye to eye or they would understand your perspective.
10
Do you think something changed in the meantime?
11
Well, I first want to be careful to say they listen to everybody.
12, the Chinese are way better than we are of hearing a hundred different views.
13
Mine would be one of many, many, many that they heard.
14
So, I was very impressed by the competence of the Chinese leaders.
15
So, I gave a lecture in their party training school where if you're a mayor, you're a provincial governor, you're any bureaucrat on your way up, you go to this thing, which for them is Harvard Business School.
16
They really looked for competence.
17
So, of course, there were various loyalty things, but you meet the leaders, and I met a lot of them.
18
And when I was at the school, I met a whole bunch of people.
19
They asked really raw questions, too.
20
They said things I couldn't believe it that they were asking.
21
And I was told,, within the school, you're allowed to say anything.
22
So, they had this system for a long time.
23
And when you met Chinese technocrats or even,, the mayor of Shanghai, they were impressive.
24
I'm not saying ours aren't, but it's a mix.
25, I think that.
26
And then Xi Jinping has really changed that.
27
So he's been the president since 2013.
28
And he's over time pushed out this system and gone more to loyalists and people who are less technocratic.
29
I, probably the most important talk I ever did in China was to what's called the China Development Forum in 2016.
30
It's this giant hall that had most of the top leaders in the party, a lot of the elite of the tech world, Mark Zuckerberg and many others that were there.
31
I said, I'm looking at your housing.
32
I'm looking at your infrastructure.
33
It looks to me you're going in a classical housing crisis problem.
34
Your catch up is over.
35
Your demographics don't look good.
36
I gave a list of things.
37
And by the way, it looks power is becoming very centralized in the economy.
38
And I'm a Western economist.
39
You're doing an amazing job.
40
What do I know?
41
But I don't think that would be good for growth.
42
And I have to say, after I gave the talk, I just figured,, you only live once.
43
You just have to say what you have to say.
44
The couple top leaders came up to me and said, Professor Rokoff, we very much appreciated your remarks.
45
And I was thinking,, oh no,, they're going to put me in jail or something at the end of this.
46
But, yeah, no, I'm less impressed by them now.
47
And I'm worried that let's say we get into a tangle with the, let me back up.
48
They get in a crisis, which they're in now.
49
I think they're in a deep crisis still.
50
Or somehow hotter heads prevail between the United States and China and we get in some entanglement nobody wants.
51
I worry that we're not as competent.
52
I'm speaking about right now.
53
We have some very good people, but the average quality at the very top, I think, has gone down.
54
And China's not as competent.
55
That's a recipe for having bad things happen.
56
By the way, on that talk, so you mentioned in the book that before they got to clear your talk, and so you gave them a watered-down version of what you would say.
57
I have to say that that would take gusto to go up to the top party leaders.
58
Were you nervous while you were giving the talk and you're, oh, it's too centralized?
59
And, I was pretty experienced by that time.
60
And I frankly never used notes.
61
So the idea I was going to read my speech didn't come to me.
62
And maybe it was a little bit spontaneous.
63
But yeah,, I think I felt at that moment,, what am I here for?
64
What's the point of coming to this?
65
Why don't I talk about the elephant in the room?
66
Everybody knows this.
67
I don't know if everybody knew it, but it was clear to me.
68
And I'm going to say it.
69
Yeah.
70, I think a lot of people in that situation usually, even though they should, or the logic makes sense, but I think people often don't.
71
Yeah, I'm a professor.
72
So people who had a big tech company or finance company or all these businesses, most of the other people, they can't afford to do that.
73, they just, but,, as a professor, and I think they know that when they invite a professor, they can't cut your bill.
74
They can stop you from going again.
75
They invited me again, by the way.
76
Although the second time, I just talked to a tiny room instead of the big hall.
77
But yeah, no,, I give credit to the Chinese for listening.
78
So you've said that the seeds of their current crisis were sown in 2010 with their big stimulus.
79
But so is it wrong then to blame Xi Jinping for this?
80
It was,, before his time, under Hu Jintao, that they did the stimulus that's causing all these problems now, right?
81
Well, Hu Jintao did it, but they kept it going.
82
So the local government debt, that was an innovation put in in the 2010 stimulus, but they left it going and used it as a stimulus program long tangent.
83
But the local governments don't have enough ways to fund themselves.
84
So they were allowed to sell land, to start these, fund these construction companies and stuff, get revenue and fund themselves, and they let it keep going.
85
When Xi Jinping came in, I was told he was going to be Ronald Reagan.
86
I had very good contacts in the intellectual spheres in China.
87
Someone who had worked for me when I was chief economist at the IMF, other people I knew who I really trust.
88
They're really smart and connected, and they're still smart and connected.
89
So I don't want to say their names.
90
But they were telling me he's going to change everything.
91, this is really the time we're going to liberalize our markets a bit.
92, we're going to do things that we haven't done.
93
And he didn't that much.
94, and if you look at China's growth, it slowed down quite a bit when he came into power.
95
So there are different ways to measure a country's output because China produces completely different stuff than we do.
96
And they use their currency and we produce our currency.
97
Nothing's perfect.
98
But one way to do is just say, what do they report their output to be in Chinese currency?
99
What do we report our output to be in dollars?
100
And let's take the exchange rate.
101
And that's how we compare.
102
And we can look at growth that way.
103
And if you look at growth that way for China, it's been spectacular.
104
It's been very, very good.
105
And it's obviously,, they're pulling it out of thin air.
106
But there are these approaches to trying to control for how you really would compare how an ordinary person lives or their measures, how an ordinary firm,, gets by.
107
And when you look at those measures, China's growth is quite a bit less.
108
So instead of, say, if you go 1980 to 2012, the official growth rate is almost 10%.
109
This purchasing power parity rate, forgive me for using those words, just over 7%.
110
Then if you look in more recent years, it's really slowed down a lot.
111
Even the official numbers have slowed down.
112
I don't know the number off the top of my head, but it's 6 or 7% for Xi Jinping, and maybe only 3.5%.
113
And they're starting from a very low base.
114
So, okay,, things were going to slow down.
115
It's not all his fault.
116
But I think he's been reluctant to take risks.
117
And I think it's gotten us to where we are, where I think they're in a lot of trouble.
118
They're overbuilt in infrastructure.
119
They're overbuilt in housing.
120
Have you been to China?
121
I was there six months ago.
122
So where did you go?
123
Shanghai, Beijing, Chongqing, Chengdu, Hangzhou, and Amisham.
124
So you saw a few of them, the medium-sized cities, and you probably immediately felt at least a couple of them.
125
I'm not sure where all the new, at least one of them I think is a new tech center, and I can't pronounce it.
126
Hangzhou?
127
Yeah, is a big tech center.
128
But some of the smaller cities, they don't feel the big cities.
129
And 60% of Chinese income is from what they call their tier three cities.
130
I grew up in Rochester.
131
That's a tier three city in the United States.
132
But you could pick Cincinnati, Liverpool, Rouren, I may not be saying it right, in France as an example of a tier three city.
133
And they have invested crazy.
134
I've been to a few, and I've studied the data on a lot.
135
They have amazing roads, amazing real estate, amazing housing, but the feel of death in those cities.
136
And so they were very good at building stuff.
137
The Soviet Union was very good at building cement factories and steel plants and railroads.
138
But that's run their course.
139
And they have other stuff, green energy, AI, electric vehicles.
140
But believe it or not, that stuff's still tiny compared to infrastructure and real estate's a third of the economy by some measures.
141
So, I think they're in a lot of trouble now in China, and they let it go on too long.
142
But again, I wasn't running things.
143
If you try to change, if things seem to be working and you try to change things, you get thrown out.
144
It's not easy to be in those shoes.
145
When I was in China, we visited a town of half a million people outside of Chengdu, so one of these tier three cities.
146
And arriving there,, the train station is huge, compounds are huge.
147
Even when you're driving around, a movie theater is this humongous complex.
148
And I realized things are bigger in China.
149
I was used to that because I'd seen these other cities by that point.
150
But I just thought, I've seen cities of half a million people.
151
I live in a city of half a million people in San Francisco, right?
152
Things are, this just doesn't seem proportionate to the size of the population.
153
And then we visited a Buddhist temple that had been built recently as it were a site.
154
And it was ginormous.
155
You would go through one a little shrine, and then behind it would be an even bigger structure, and then another one concentrically for, I don't know, eight turns.
156 it would take you probably 10 minutes to drive through this thing.
157
And there was just nobody there.
158
It was me and three other white people.
159
No, it's very much that feeling.
160
And the young people don't want to live there.
161
I have a lot of young people here as students, and I run into people.
162
They don't want to live in these towns and the jobs aren't there.
163
I can't criticize them for trying that.
164
If you'd asked me in 2005, should we try to encourage people to go out to the Rochesters and the Liverpools and the Rennes, Francis?
165
I would say yes.
166
There's too much in the big cities.
167
There's overcrowding.
168
Look what happened to Sao Paulo.
169
Look what happened to Mumbai.
170
But,, I would have been wrong.
171, that these forces are very powerful.
172
So a lot of their growth and what they call their GDP is this stuff.
173
And so they're having to reorient.
174
And,,, people just aren't that flexible.
175
It's when AI comes and puts everybody out of jobs, when construction jobs are gone and when all these indirect things are gone, it's not that easy to move everyone.
176
If it hadn't been for financial repression, and suppose all this investment had been done through,, purely market mechanisms, would things have turned out much better?
177, even today, say today, China gets rid of all financial repression.
178
They save a lot, right?
179
So this money has to go somewhere.
180
Were there enough productive opportunities to soak up all these savings?
181
Or could there have been in the past?
182, if they get rid of financial, is this a problem solved or could it have been solved?
183
Well, what everyone's told them forever is their saving rate and investment rate are astounding.
184
And I,, it was higher before, but it's still maybe 45% or something, their consumption rate.
185
Ours is pushing 70%.
186
European countries are a little more temperate, but they're in the low 60s.
187
Their consumption is very low.
188
They have some wealthy people that you saw when you go to the marquee cities, but a lot of China's living on,, $200 a month incomes.
189
You could give them money.
190
You could let them consume instead of exporting it.
191
They've been very reluctant to do that.
192, so you could do things to encourage consumption.
193
You could even just changing their exchange rate policy to allow it to appreciate more at times would make imports more less expensive.
194
They have been very reluctant to do that.
195
That's what everyone tells them.
196
That's certainly what I said in 2016 also.
197
The ticket to getting people to spend more is to provide more security than they have.
198
So, first of all, there's nothing our social security system you need to save your old age.
199
There's nothing our health system.
200
If you work at one of the big state-owned factories, they give you health care.
201
But otherwise, you're on your own.
202
They're not allowed to invest abroad.
203, they're not allowed.
204, they have, it goes in waves, but they're not allowed to put their money abroad.
205
So, they're trying to be careful about all of that and not do things suddenly.
206
There's nothing to do overnight, but fundamentally, if you're looking at China and say, what's wrong?
207
It's that the consumer isn't spending enough.
208
And what's happening right now is worse because housing prices are collapsing.
209
That's the only thing they really let people save in.
210
You could either save in a bank account, which you got a crummy interest rate, or a house.
211
They're going down.
212
So people are cutting back.
213
They can dig their way out.
214
There's no magic bullet to make them grow at 5%, which is, by the way, the official number, but I don't think they're anywhere near that.
215, there's no simple thing, but the general thing would be to try to rebalance saving, investment, and consumption.
216
Going back to your point about is purchasing power parity the right way to compare or is nominal the right way to compare?
217
I think in the book you say the nominal comparison of GDP is better because you can't buy paid shirt missiles or oil with purchasing power parity dollars.
218
But if we're trying to compare the strength of the two countries, the relative strength, especially in a military context, if they can build ships for much cheaper and munitions were much cheaper and they had to pay their soldiers less, isn't that more relevant if we were trying to figure out who would win in a war?
219
So shouldn't we be looking at the fact that they have a bigger PPP economy than us as a sign that they're stronger?
220
Yeah, so, in the book, I'm talking about your geopolitical power, where if you're going to give money to somebody, what's it worth and how much they can use it?
221
No, but you're absolutely right.
222, they just crush us in shipbuilding.
223
It's partly because they build commercial ships and there's a lot of symbiosis between commercial and military.
224
I think they're 50% of the global shipbuilding market.
225
For us to build a new aircraft carrier is,, takes years and years and years, incredible expense.
226
And, I think one of the mistakes we're making about trying to build everything ourselves, let our allies do some of this.
227
The Koreans are really good at building ships.
228
That's another place we could be importing from.
229
You're right about the soldiers.
230, they're paid much less.
231
It's,, they have a lot of advantages in a conflict against us.
232
We're way ahead in your department, tech.
233
And that is our advantage at the moment.
234
If that were to dissipate, it would certainly hurt.
235
What is your projection?
236
So right now, I think their nominal GDP per capita, in dollar, GDP is 75% of America's or something that.
237
Yeah, what we call the market terms.
238
Yeah.
239
What's your projection by 2030 and by 2040?
240
The ratio?
241
So I didn't realize it was as high as 75%.
242
I thought it was a little lower.
243
Because we were going to look at the 20%.
244
I was going to say 75% in 2020.
245, it said one point in 2024 is around two-thirds.
246
But it's really volatile with the exchange rate.
247
The dollar's really high.
248
So when the dollar is really high, it makes us look bigger.
249
I think they'll gain about a percent a year on us, maybe.
250
I don't think they're going to grow way faster than the United States.
251
That means you think they will never have a bigger economy than us.
252
Or at least in the It'll take a long, long time.
253
So we're talking about the absolute size they have, four times as many people.
254
But yeah,, there were these projections by Goldman Sachs, by many others, that we'd be Canada is to the United States pretty soon.
255
And I think, all these extrapolations, that proves wrong.
256
Which brings me to, I think, a big topic, which is a lot of people will look at some trend, whether it's growth in something, AI, China, and just project it into the future.
257
And I think economists at least consider ourselves terrible at that.
258
When you go back and look at any of these commissions that were supposed to figure out what was going on, and they happen periodically.
259
Maybe Brookings institution puts one together.
260
Maybe the government does.
261
And my former colleague, the late Dick Cooper, had a whole list of these.
262
So it is very hard to know.
263
But my gut instinct is what's happening to China, is what's happened to Japan, what's happened to Asia, what happened to the Soviet Union, where we have a more dynamic economy.
264
We're not perfect, and maybe we're screwing it up right now with all the terrorists and the globalization.
265
But we have this dynamism and creativity that other places, at least other large economies, just can't replicate.
266
They can build stuff.
267, the French have better high-speed trains than we do.
268
I hope you don't ride on the train from Boston to New York.
269, it's nicer than it could be, but it's no high-speed train.
270
You mentioned China, oh my gosh, their high-speed trains are just incredible.
271
They're good at that.
272
But the really creative stuff, I don't want to say,, there's some amazing Chinese companies, but let me say the U.S.
273
is really good at it.
274
And we've kept that in our DNA.
275
And I think that's very important to preserve it.
276, the 1% per year compression is extremely bearish forecast because even people who are pessimistic about China will say, oh, by 2040, there'll be 150% or 125% of U.S.
277
nominal.
278
It'll be bigger, but it will only be slightly bigger.
279
And so the fact that you think even by 2040, they won't have caught up is very bearish.
280
I think they're digging their way out of a crisis.
281
The idea right now, we know their prices are falling.
282
And it's not because they're inventing stuff really fast.
283
We know that interest rates are being pushed to zero.
284
All these symbols of there's a demand, demand's been crushed and the economy is not doing well.
285
So I would say historically, they have given numbers which are accurate on average, as best as we can tell.
286
I think that's gotten less and less true in the Xi Jinping era.
287
When Brissot first started working with massive enterprises GitHub, EBA, and IBM, they realized that these customers couldn't even begin using their platform without single sign-on.
288
So, what did Vercell do?
289
Well, they could decide to build it themselves, but that would take months.
290
And plus, they'd need a bunch of other features Skim, RBAC, audit logs, and much more.
291
Instead, they reached for WorkOS, the platform that makes apps enterprise-ready.
292
With WorkOS, Vercell was able to ship SSO super fast and continue their hypergrowth.
293
And they're not the only one.
294
Today, WorkOS powers over a thousand top companies, including AI giants OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity.
295
If you're a startup, time is your most precious asset.
296
And WorkOS is a time machine that lets you get to enterprise ready faster.

298
Going back to the subject of your book, will there, so people who are trying to predict whether when and how China will invade or blockade Taiwan will look at satellite photos of different docks and see how many ships are.
299
So they'll look at military preparedness.
300
From a monetary perspective, are there signs that we could be watching for?
301
For example, if they think that a lot of their American-dominated assets will get sanctioned or they won't have access to them, could we see them liquidating them?
302
Or would there be any preparations that we could see on the monetary side that would let us know that they're doing something which something big that they're preparing for?
303
Well, I don't think they're going to do it suddenly, but just on very crudely on their reserves, they're definitely moving more and more into gold.
304
It doesn't help necessarily to move into Euro or Canadian dollars because they might side with us, but they're doing what they can to diversify.
305
I don't think they've diversified into crypto yet.
306
I had a student do a paper on that, but who knows?
307
What they are doing very concretely is not just what are they holding.
308
That's the big fact everybody looks at.
309
officially hold a trillion dollars in treasury reserves.
310
The estimate a student of mine did in a nice paper, and I think others agree with, is more $2 trillion.
311
They hold a lot indirectly through proxies.
312
But the other part of it is just the whole financial system runs through the United States.
313
What we sometimes call the rails or the pipes of the system.
314
So your bank,, gets a purchase and my bank gets that I'm going to get a credit.
315
How does that take place?
316
How does it take place and we're in different countries?
317
The United States just disproportionately controls that.
318
And that they can't live with.
319
They could live without their $2 trillion for a little while, but they can't live without being able to pay suppliers and countries.
320
So they're working hard on developing their own payments mechanisms.
321
Russia did quite a bit in preparation for the invasion.
322
And we see China doing that.
323
Maybe they're selling Treasury bills.
324
We don't know exactly.
325
I would advise that to them, if I were a Chinese economist talking to them.
326
But I don't think it's going to be something they'll do suddenly because,, maybe Trump will bring down the markets and then there's nothing to save, but they don't want to be the ones to bring down the markets and the cause of global warming.
327
What is the alternative rails they would build look?
328
Are they buying oil from Iran, an RMB?
329
Will other countries that they need things from accept that?
330
In 2030, what is their goal?
331
Well, so absolutely.
332
There are a lot of countries in Africa, Latin America.
333
Some of them are almost client states of China that they can force, but they sell.
334
Iran, of course, sells,, a lot of its oil to China, even when there's sanctions.
335
And they're moving in that direction.
336
It's not just about the what you invoice, the payment.
337
It's how do we acknowledge it?
338
How do we clear our books?
339
That's what they're working on.
340
And it's coming.
341, the Europeans are working on it too, by the way.
342
Europe is not happy with the situation.
343
They're forming a central bank digital currency that's moving quite a bit faster than I thought it would be.
344
And that's one of the reasons that they're doing it for international payments.
345
Okay, so let's talk about Japan, which you also cover in the book or their crisis.
346
And you blame the U.S.'s pressure in advance of that crisis on the Japanese to raise the value of their currency, the actions by the Bank of Japan.
347
Zooming out, how much of the crisis is not caused by things that, but just the fact that high-tech manufacturing as a share of world output was becoming less important.
348
There's demographic factors as well.
349
And so something this was bound to happen to Japan, even if there wasn't some big crisis that preceded it.
350
South Korea's GDP per capita isn't that high either, so at least in comparison to the U.S.
351
So, yeah, how much of this is actions taken by specific actors versus, South Korea has had a crisis in 1983 and 1997.
352, they haven't been crisis-free, by the way.
353
That they're well, there are a lot of factors.
354
The demographics would be the most obvious one.
355
The rise of China, the rise of not just China, Korea, other competitors.
356
So, Japan invented this business model that I think a lot of countries have duplicated.
357
The business model was export-led growth.
358
And the thing that maybe most people wouldn't think about in that is it creates competition.
359
Most countries aren't as big as the United States, and there aren't as many different firms trying to do the same thing.
360
And of course, we have trouble with competition here.
361, famously in Mexico sometime, there were,, two or one telephone companies, two bread companies, two taco companies.
362
It's very hard not to let monopolies sit, use their political power.
363
So, how do you get around that?
364
And the thing that Japan did that was really pretty innovative, and Germany did it, I think, to some extent also, was in the export sector, you are competing with the world, not just with other companies.
365
And that creates this innovation, this creativity.
366
And Japan did really well with that, but over time, others imitated it and took, were building some of the things that they were building.
367
So, that's part of it.
368
The aging is part of it.
369
But I think the financial crisis is a very big part of it.
370
And what is it counterfactual?
371
So, suppose that crisis hadn't happened.
372
How much wealthier is Japan today than America?
373
Oh, I think 50% wealthier per person.
374
I think way wealthier.
375
That's where they started.
376, it depends on which measure you use by the market exchange rates.
377
They were richer than the United States,, late 1980s.
378
And even if you use the more complicated measure, they were richer than any European country, than Germany, than France, than Italy.
379
They moved to the bottom of the rung now.
380
And I think the financial crisis, okay, it wasn't the only thing, but we,, it's a long story, but I think we effectively forced them to move faster, to open up and deregulate than culturally and politically they were ready to.
381
And I give that as an example of something in the book where I changed my mind, where I had looked at that for a long time afterwards, because,, going back to 2005, that's long after the Japanese crisis, I would hear from Zhang Xiaomin, who's the president of China that I met, we're not going to let this happen to us.
382
There's no way.
383, we were discussing, I thought maybe they shouldn't have such a fixed exchange rate.
384
And I said, well, that's what the United States said to Japan.
385
And look what happened to Japan.
386
And I,, I didn't push back that much to someone that.
387
You talked to other people, but I heard that from many people.
388
And I used to think,, well, how can that be?
389
Because all of these things, there's this thing called the Plaza Accord in September 1985, where we pushed them to make their exchange rate more.
390
And I used to say, well, why do you do that in 1985?
391, the crisis happened, Reinhardt and I, Carmen Reinhardt, my co-author on many things.
392
We date the crisis in 1992.
393
It's seven years later.
394
And I think I continued to think that.
395
But,, I would say over the years, and particularly in recent years, I'm thinking I was wrong.
396, these things unfold slowly.
397
Crises don't happen overnight.
398
They deregulated and it worked, but they didn't know what they were doing.
399
And I think this was a huge mistake by Japan to agree.
400
And I, someone who was at a 10th anniversary of the Plaza Accord held in Tokyo had the person who was the head of the Bank of Japan, and I apologize, I'm 72 years old and I'm forgetting the name exactly.
401
So the head in 1985.
402
And he gave this speech to officials and he went this and apologized,, very symbolically.
403
I have ruined our country.
404
I did this.
405
I take responsibility.
406
And again, I thought,,, he told that to when he read my book.
407
And yeah, financial repression is bad, but financial liberalization needs to be done gradually.
408
And if you do it too quickly, you get a crisis.
409
That's many crises caused by that.
410
Asking somebody who obviously doesn't know the details at a high level, how would you explain to a novice?
411, basically, how could a country be 50% less wealthy than it otherwise might have been simply from financial crises?
412
Because if whatever they could have otherwise produced, why can't they still not produce it?
413
Or,, a country is they're producing a bunch of things.
414
Why are they producing 50% less things because of a financial crisis a couple decades ago?
415
Well, their case is very unusual.
416
Although having a number 10% or 20% is very typical.
417
In fact, one of my professors at MIT was teaching us the Great Depression, and he said, here's how to think about the Great Depression.
418
We were going this.
419
It's hard to do without a blackboard.
420
But then he says,, then we get here, we go this, and then we're going this.
421
We never got this back.
422, that happened.
423
There's a lot of economic models where you,, so-called empirical.
424
Yeah, yes, yes.
425
But what happens with the financial crisis, particularly in Japan, is it blew up their business model.
426
So, for example, maybe China wouldn't have overtaken them so quickly if they had been able to borrow and their financial markets were working better and they were more adroit.
427
Their consumption collapsed and Japan didn't quite know how to deal with it.
428
We were much more brutal in what we allowed to happen than Japan, but we got out of it pretty quickly.
429
I don't quite know where we got back to where we were, but we got out very quickly.
430
They have a very consensus society.
431
They don't want anyone to be in bad shape.
432
And their struggle with this, I think, held them back for a long time.
433
Okay, maybe 50% is too much, and I should say 25% or 30%, but a lot better shape than they have been.
434
Just to put it into context, what do you think the counterfactual wealth of America looks without 2008 today?
435
Boy, that's a good question.
436
And I'm hesitant to, because I probably have some paper giving a number for that, and I might say the wrong thing.
437
We certainly cumulatively lost a lot and it led to this political crisis that caused us to lose a lot more.
438
So, I don't know, probably 15% lower, a lot, a lot, a lot lower than it would be, because we had all this dynamic, which we're living in right now, is still an echo of that financial crisis.
439
Now, mind you, you're asking about our national income inequality matters, and would we have done other things?
440
And I don't want to,, in some ways, the 2008-2009 crisis was a condemnation of the system, and people could see it and maybe led to some healthy cleansing, but I think it led to a lot more damage than healthy cleansing.
441
I think this updates me towards the view that financial crises are even worse than I think.
442, it isn't just this bad thing that happens and you recover.
443
If there's 15% lingering even after, what, almost 20 years, then I think they're just, oh, wow, that's the same thing.
444
You're usually losing a lot of cumulative growth.
445, you look at Greece today or Portugal.
446
You get back to where you're having a positive growth rate, but you're not picking up.
447
They're very different than a normal recession.
448
And, in a normal recession, you go down and then back up.
449
The United States had thought it was immune to financial crises.
450
We really hadn't had one since 1933.
451
And a different book that came out in 2009, I mostly write papers, but this was a book with Carmen Reinhart.
452
It was called This Time is Different, where we had some papers published in advance.
453
And we said, no, they're different when you have a financial crisis.
454
It lasts way longer.
455
The slowdown is way worse.
456
And we were mocked when we were saying that.
457
I think the New York Times had a two-page spread saying how ridiculous everyone thought this was.
458
We could have proved wrong, and maybe if we'd done things better, we would have, but it is the norm.
459
There's a few exceptions Sweden got out in a year or two, but normally they really are different than a normal recession.
460
Publicly available data is running out.
461
So major AI labs Meta, Google DeepMind, and OpenAI all partner with Scale to push the boundaries of what's possible.
462
Through Scales Data Foundry, major labs get access to high-quality data to fuel post-training, including advanced reasoning capabilities.
463
Scale's research team, SEAL, is creating the foundations for integrating advanced AI into society through practical AI safety frameworks and public leaderboards around safety and alignment.
464
Their latest leaderboards include Humanities Last Exam, Enigma Eval, Multi-Challenge, and Vista, which test a range of capabilities from expert-level reasoning to multimodal puzzle solving to performance on multi-turn conversations.
465
Scale also just released Scale Evaluation, which helps diagnose model limitations.
466
Leading frontier model developers rely on scale evaluation to improve the reasoning capabilities of their best models.
467
If you're an AI researcher or engineer and you want to learn more about how Scale's Data Foundry and Research Lab can help you go beyond the current Frontier capabilities, go to scale.com/slash ThwarCash.
468
So you say in the book that you expect there to be another spike in inflation within the next decade.
469
And also the fiscal position of the United States, it doesn't seem sustainable.
470
If you go forward 10 years, 20 years, when we do hit this, when the Piper comes calling, what happens?
471
Is it going to be some acute crisis happened in Greece?
472
Are we going to have some lost decade thing Japan?
473
What will happen?
474
Typically, you have a crisis of some sort when your debt is high, your political system, your politics are inflexible.
475
We check those boxes.
476
And you get hit by a shock you weren't ready for.
477
You get caught on your back foot.
478
It depends on what the shock is.
479
It depends on how we react.
480
The way Japan reacted was they used what we call financial repression, which basically stuffed debt into every insurance company, pension fund, bank.
481
The central bank holds almost 100% of GDP in debt.
482, we think we have a lot.
483
I don't know the number off the top of my head of the Fed, but I want to say $7 trillion.
484
They would have the equivalent of $30 trillion.
485, so they've done this.
486
It's not the only reason they haven't grown, not by any means.
487
But it's not good for growth.
488
So that's one option.
489
I think for the United States, that's tough.
490
We just are very market-driven.
491
If our financial system had that pressure put on it, it would be worse than when they did it for Japan.
492
And a lot of people lend to us.
493
We can't do that to them.
494
We can't force French insurance companies to hold U.S.
495
debt.
496
We can just force U.S.
497
ones.
498
So I think the most likely thing will be inflation, which only lets off steam because inflation pulls the, it's a default.
499
I'm not talking about hyperinflation.
500 10, 20% inflation over a period.
501
We just went through that.
502
That knocked about 10% of GDP off our debt.
503
We might need more next time.
504
So it lets some steam off.
505
But if you're still spending too much and we haven't fixed anything, you're back in the problem.
506
That's what's going on now.
507
We had some steam let off, but it wasn't enough.
508
But I think when it happens again, markets will be very unforgiving about it.
509
They will look at us and say, you are not to be trusted.
510
And so it'll raise the interest rate more.
511
Our debt will build up faster.
512
And I think at that point, there's the saying about Americans that's attributed to Winston Churchill.
513
We always do the right thing after we try everything else.
514
And I suspect we will try other things.
515
Yeah.
516
So just for the audience, there's four ways we could get out of the debt.
517
We could default, which you don't think is likely.
518
But really good for my book.
519
Well,, already you timed this one so well.
520
I'm sorting the market when your next one comes out.
521
I got a new wave.
522
Financial repression.
523
I guess you could cut the deficit or inflation.
524
And you say, well, if there's another round of inflation, then after that.
525
There'll be austerity.
526
What everyone calls austerity, which, by the way, this word austerity, the progressives use whenever you just ignore debt building up and spend whatever you want.
527
And austerities when you don't do that.
528, I think Ezra Klein's book makes the abundance, makes the point that there are benefits,, costs and benefits to a lot of things.
529
And this austerity language is pretending there are no costs, having your debt be higher, they're only benefits.
530
So, yeah, yes, that's what everyone else has to do.
531
And we've gone longer than most without doing it.
532
If it's going to be a financial crisis, then a financial crisis are these benefits.
533
Inflation crisis.
534
So whether there'll be a financial crisis of the private sector and the public sector bails out the private sector.
535
So the government, we're not going to default.
536
We're going to inflate or do financial repression or,, baby steps, austerity,, something.
537
We're not going to have a crisis Greece had it.
538
That's just wrong.
539
But inflation's not pleasant.
540
Why wouldn't we?
541
Because we can print money.
542, we can honor our debts.
543
We just never have to default.
544
Greece was using the Euro and didn't have control.
545
Japan was using its own currency and it didn't default.
546
They had a financial crisis, not a debt crisis.
547
So they never defaulted on their government debt in that period.
548
I'm not sure if they ever did in our oh, yeah, no, I'm sorry.
549
They did in World War II.
550
Of course, Japan defaulted on its government debt in World War II.
551
That's an interesting story.
552
But no, it was a financial crisis they had.
553
So a financial crisis is making your banking system not work, lending to innovators not work, lending to dynamic companies not work.
554
Ben Bernanke really wrote at the time a thought piece about this.
555
He didn't really have numbers.
556
He conjectured that was why the Great Depression was so bad when Milton Friedman, one of the great economists of all time, looked at the Great Depression.
557
He said, you didn't print enough money.
558
You tightened the money supply too much.
559
And Ben came along 50 years later, something,, 25 years later.
560
He was a classmate of mine in graduate school, and I had the office next to him at Princeton.
561
And he came along and wrote this amazing paper, again, just a thought piece, which is not a typical economics paper, where he said, if it was just you didn't print enough money, eventually wages and prices would adjust.
562
Yeah, maybe it wouldn't happen in a year.
563
Maybe it wouldn't happen in two years.
564
But the Depression took 10 years.
565
How can that be?
566
And he made this conjecture that there's been a lot of subsequent work showing, again, there's debate about this.
567
Let me be careful.
568
But I certainly view the weight of evidence saying financial crises are really bad, which has led us to the situation in the United States where we've gotten a little happy-go-lucky about bailing everyone out.
569
I would describe Treasury Federal Reserve policy today as when in doubt, bail it out, because they saw what happened.
570
But as your financial sector grows,, that will lead to a problem someday.
571
It did, of course, in the Silicon Valley Bank and continues to have echoes of that.
572
But I think an inflation crisis is more likely than a financial crisis, although these things are very hard to predict.
573
You say in the book that we didn't outgrow our World War II debt, what happened instead was that financial repression after World War II, and then the inflation of the 70s made what our debt to GDP ratio then should have been 70-something, and it was 20-something instead.
574
And of course, we had inflation recently.
575
So, do you think there's some irrationality in the market for U.S.
576
government debt already, given the fact that we can forecast what's going to happen here?
577
They can read your book and say that inflation is going to go up and the debt they're holding will be worth less.
578
They can look through history at what's happened.
579
So, do you think there's just some irrationality in terms of what people are doing?
580
I think number one is they have too much faith in the independence of the Federal Reserve.
581
So, the Federal Reserve's been this amazing institution that has evolved and it has been the guardian of having, we can argue about if it's the right inflation or not, but having low inflation.
582
And the Federal Reserve insists it's very independent.
583
The Supreme Court recently ruled Trump couldn't fire Powell.
584
He's the head of the Fed.
585
I think they're dreaming that there are so many ways Congress and the president could override the Fed, particularly if they declare there's some wartime or war-on-pandemic situation.
586
Yeah, though, I wonder if, from the politicians' perspective, the independence of the Fed gives them some way to pass the buck that they're happy about.
587
So, they'd be, oh, I'd love to, I'd love to do this irresponsible thing, but I can't because the Fed,, it's out of my hands.
588
No, that's for sure.
589
So, that's why Trump bashes the Fed.
590
It's not the only reason he does, but he bashes the Fed.
591
I think he disagrees with them, but he feels bashing the Fed, if there is a recession, which there might be, he'll blame the Fed for not lowering interest rates.
592
It depends.
593
If we run into this world where interest rates start creeping up, the 10-year rate right now, I didn't look in the last minutes, but around 4.5%.
594
That's not indexed.
595
The index one is about a little over 2%.
596
The 30-year rates are around 5%.
597
I think those are going to drift up.
598
And that makes mortgage rates go up.
599
It makes student loans go up.
600
It makes car loans go up.
601
Business loans go up.
602
And it's painful.
603
And there's a question at what point that pain starts being real.
604
And then, particularly, I mentioned I thought this would be catalyzed if we're hit by a shock where you can somewhat take back independence temporarily from the Fed.
605
But I think it's easier to do than people think.
606
And given that I think shocks are going to happen, maybe AGI will bring us a shock that we don't imagine that people trust that too much.
607, Fed independence, I love.
608
I wrote the first paper on that of why you should have an independent central bank back when there were virtually no independent central banks.
609
I was a pawn at the Federal Reserve.
610, I'm talking my book to say it's a great idea.
611
I don't mean my book book, but my human capital.
612
But it's,, I to say that the Federal Reserve fights for its independence every day.
613
And I hear senators and people that say they're idiots.
614
I hear people in Silicon Valley tell me they're idiots.
615
And,, we should bring them under the Treasury.
616
I used to hear that just from progressives.
617
And now I heard that recently from some tech titans that Scott Besson, he's the Treasury Secretary, smarter than Powell.
618
Why don't we let him run things, et cetera?
619
They could.
620
It does seem the Fed works really well as it exists now, right?
621
It's independent.
622
There's people, as you say, who criticize its actions.
623
But on the whole, it seems a reliable institution which makes smart calls.
624
They can be wrong, of course, but it seems just so much more competent than much of the rest of government.
625
And if you wanted to replicate how the Fed works, if you wanted other parts of the government to work this way, is there something we could do or is it just maybe it's more so a human capital problem rather than an independence problem?
626 bankers and economists are really smart.
627
And I don't know if you could replicate that in the education department or the agriculture department or something.
628
Well, one of the things the Fed has is a simple barometer that everybody sees.
629
They don't really see it, but they have a feeling.
630
They see gasoline prices is probably how they decide what inflation is.
631
But they have just this simple barometer.
632
Mind you, particularly in recent years, progressives have wanted them to solve inequality, social justice, the environment.
633
But they have one barometer that they control over the long run, not in the short run, but over the long run.
634
So that makes it a little easier to say you wanted us to have low inflation.
635
Whereas so many other things the government does is they might be making everybody better off, but they're making some people more better off.
636
Maybe some people are not better off.
637
And it suddenly becomes very political.
638
Nobody elected the Fed.
639
So it's harder to make those decisions.
640
I'm obviously a technocrat,, or aside with technocrats.
641
My students are technocrats.
642
I think way more things should be that.
643
Right.
644
But if you wanted to do that, suppose you get called by the Pentagon tomorrow and you said, we want to run the Pentagon the Fed.
645
What do you tell them to do?
646
Well, I was going to say the Pentagon, I'm not speaking of the current Pentagon, but let's just, up till now, I haven't looked closely.
647
That's been run pretty darn well.
648, it's the military's pretty efficient.
649
There are people who tell me, okay, Elon Musk can take a payload into space at 15% of, or maybe it's 115th of what NASA does.
650
Why don't we let Elon Musk,, run the Pentagon?
651
And there may be something to that.
652
I think to some extent, and maybe I'm defending them too much, but you never know where the next blow is going to come from.
653
It always looks a lot of your stuff's wasted.
654
You built up, but your enemy's looking at what you have.
655
Where are you weak?
656
Where are you strong?
657
So I wouldn't have picked them as the obvious thing.
658
But let's say crypto regulation would be a good example of why don't we have something more independent?
659
Instead, it's what you well know what's happened.
660
It's been overrun by politics.
661
In fact, we have this, there's this huge thing going on right now.
662
I don't know how it's going to play out, where the Fed's been protected, though not as much as you think, but Trump's got to the Supreme Court and been told he can fire the head of any agency.
663
And I assume by inference, he can also fire anybody at any agency.
664
So it's just, I think that's a terrible mistake.
665, I think we need to have independent agencies.
666
And you have an evaluation process.
667
They answer to Congress.
668
They go off in the wrong direction.
669
You try to fix it.
670
But to just have everything switch every four years.
671
Before Trump, maybe for intrinsic reasons, maybe because of norms, it was really hard to fire people.
672
Anyways, and that didn't produce remarkable competence across the government.
673
So, let me see if I can consolidate some of the things you mentioned.
674
Maybe it's really important that there's, maybe we should structure more of the government that,, if you're running this department, you have this one target that's similar to the Fed's 2% inflation target, and that's all you have to do.
675
Don't worry about anything else.
676
I do think it's impressive.
677
Even so, the fact that the Fed has avoided the mission creep, it seems every institution in the world does fall into mission creep companies, government.
678
Or they haven't avoided it.
679, they were under incredible pressures.
680
It's changed, but I talk about this a little also in my book: that,, you go through the working papers and the research at the various Federal Reserves, and it's all about inequality, environment, social justice.
681
You'd be strained to find papers about monetary policy during that period because they're under pressure.
682
So part of being independent is bending with the wind.
683
So, but they've managed to keep their core competency, their core setting monetary policy independent.
684
No, it's been amazing, but it's a constant fight.
685
You can go to a country Turkey where I don't know what the inflation rate is today, but it hovered up towards 100%.
686
And they just,, Ergogan, he's the president of Turkey, would be firing the head of the central bank every year.
687
Every time they tried to raise interest rates, he would fire them.
688
And you can find other countries that.
689
So we've been lucky, but you can't count on that continuing.
690
Apart from the political pressure problems from the outside, watching as you do, as you were mentioning, that your younger colleagues or the people writing the working papers at the Fed who are the younger economists are writing about these other issues inequality or climate change.
691
Even from the inside, basically, given what the younger people in this profession care about, do you still expect, whether you want to call it the competence or the focus or whatever word you want to use, that to just decline by default, given the new generation?
692
No, no.
693, this was a wake-up call.
694
So there was a paper at maybe it was a blog at Hoover did of looking at the most used words in our big annual meetings.
695
There's this thing called the American Economic Association meetings.
696
Everybody goes and they took all the abstracts and the titles for 15 years.
697
And the word inflation had not appeared until this year.
698
So why are you optimistic about when they get in charge?
699
No, but, there's an intellectual market.
700
This was a huge miss, and there's an intellectual market for figuring it out.
701
So, one of the good things about the American Economic Association, American University System, at least in the sciences, I'll speak of economics, is that, okay,, things drift off, but if it's way wrong, and they were certainly way wrong about inflation, I believe way wrong about interest rates and debt, there's,, there's some rebalancing.
702
And we have a very competitive system of publishing.
703
We have a seminar system that's just ruthless.
704
So,, there's a debate around it.
705
It's not settled, and maybe I'm wrong, and they're right, but it's definitely getting debated.
706
Whereas 10 years ago, I think I was a lone voice in the wilderness saying that these things might happen again.
707
I would teach inflation to my students, and they'd sit there patiently.
708
And it was I was teaching them,, the music of Fred Astaire or something.
709
They go, okay, that's,, that 21st century, the internet,, can never happen.
710
Or I teach debt.
711
And if I have foreign students, they're all having problems.
712, so they raise.
713
But the Americans, we can just do whatever we want,, and but it's changed.
714
Going back to the future problems potentially, if we do go the financial repression route and not the inflation route, how bad will that be?
715
As you were saying, look, after World War II, we had financial repression, but that was when we had the highest growth ever.
716
On the other hand, China and Japan, it seems a lot of their problems might be caused by the misallocation of capital caused by financial repression.
717
So do you have some intuition about how much we could screw ourselves over with that route as opposed to inflation?
718
We'll start with World War II.
719
It's never just one thing, obviously.
720
There are a lot of things.
721
So, World War II, first of all, financial repression was easy.
722
The financial markets had been destroyed by the Great Depression.
723
World War II became something of a command and control economy.
724
And I will say there's a lot of interesting papers about World War II that Americans just work really enthusiastically.
725, there was real patriotism in the production.
726
I'm not saying we're not now, but they were able to have people fill these factory jobs that we probably can't even fill today.
727
So, as we emerged from World War II, we had all the soldiers came home.
728
That's a huge growth lift.
729
And we didn't manage it perfectly.
730
We had quite a bit of inflation during that period.
731
But it was so the financial markets, as you grew up in, as young people know them today, they didn't exist back then.
732
But the world has changed a lot.
733
Does that mean that U.S.
734
growth would have been even higher after World War II if we had just kept the government debt or figured out some other way to deal with it?
735
But we had let financial markets develop earlier?
736
Maybe.
737, we didn't have any financial crises for a long time because they were very repressed.
738
And oftentimes, when you get a financial crisis, it's exactly when somebody comes along and says, I know, I can make us grow way faster.
739
Let's just take away all the rules and regulations overnight.
740
That happened in one country after another.
741
And it works until you blow up.
742
So,, you'd have to say that by and large, it was managed rather well.
743
We grew, the rest of the world grew.
744
It took time for private markets to develop.
745, a thing I should have emphasized: our debt was very high after World War II, about what it is now.
746
But there was nothing else.
747
There wasn't all this private debt that had all been defaulted on.
748
There wasn't, I'm slightly being hyperbolic, and maybe it was 50% of GDP altogether, everything else.
749
State and local debt had been defaulted on.
750
Now it's bigger than the federal debt by a wide margin.
751
So it was a different world to putting in financial repression now when that's a big part of our business models, the financial sector.
752
And just to make sure we've completed the concrete scenario, so basically, your prediction is there will be some crisis, some surge of inflation, then there will be austerity.
753
And then what happens?
754
Is growth really slow afterwards because the government can't spend as much?
755
What do the next few decades look in your world?
756
Yeah,, I think it'll be quite a wake-up call for Americans and having to do an adjustment under difficult circumstances.
757
Most likely, we just got hit by a shock.
758
We'd to borrow a lot.
759
The bonds are going up faster than they did the other times we did, and we're not able to do as much.
760
It's not the end of the world.
761
During the European debt crisis, that happened 2010 to 2012 mostly.
762
The Europeans raised their retirement ages, almost everybody.
763
They didn't do it right away.
764
They did it 10 and 15 years out.
765
And there's stuff you can do.
766
So I want to be careful to say it's not the end of the world, but pretty unpleasant.
767
I think it will go across the whole world because the world's very dollar-centric.
768
I think it will not be good for our franchise of the dollar being so used everywhere.
769
We'll maybe first, but as other countries use it less, our interest rates will be even higher.
770
So,, I'm an academic and I'm not particularly looking to put my ideas forward by being maximally hysterical.
771
But hysterical is definitely in the realm of possibility here.
772
And nothing's in the,, what I say is more likely than not,, not that it's not definitely going to happen.
773
We could have growth.
774
We could have a whole lot of high-skill immigration.
775
We could make changes.
776
There are lots of things that could go well.
777
On the growth thing, Europe's growth has been pretty bad after 2010.
778
Japan, obviously, has had pretty bad growth after their crisis.
779
So why will we be in a different position if we do have this crisis?
780
Why will growth continue a pace?
781
No, it's going to cause a pause in growth.
782, the main reason debt crises happen is we don't have an automated system of working it out.
783 when the stock market crashes, okay, it's painful, but you're looking around for who got hurt.
784
But when you have debt crashes, we take five years, 10 years to figure out who owes what.
785
It's that process of allocating the losses that causes problems.
786
And that, by the way, is why so many people thought China's fine.
787, the president will just tell everyone what it is.
788
And that turns out to be not as true as they thought.
789
Last week, I was trying to fix some admin settings for an important software tool that we use here at my podcast.
790
And I just couldn't figure it out.
791
I tried talking to different LLMs.
792
Of course, I tried checking their docs online.
793
It's one of those tasks that should take two minutes, but then you check back 30 minutes later and you still haven't finished it or made any progress.
794
I finally figured out what to do by chatting with Gemini's Live API.
795
I started a voice chat with Gemini.
796
I shared my screen and I talked through what I was trying to do.
797
It showed me what to click, guided me through a few pages of settings, and 90 seconds later, I was done.
798
It was having a remote coworker who knows a lot about everything, and you can just tap them on the shoulder and get them to help you with your task.
799
Often LLMs aren't helpful in day-to-day tasks because it's clunky to give them all the context around your problems.
800
Gemini Live's combination of voice, video, and screen sharing made it helpful to me right away.
801
Gemini Live API is now available in preview for developers to build real-time conversational experiences.
802
You can try it out today by going to AI.dev, click stream, and start talking.
803
All right, back to Kenneth.
804
Is it possible to believe both that AGI is near and that America's fiscal position is untenable?
805, what do you mean by saying AGI is coming?
806
Any job that can be done purely through computers is automated.
807
So white-collar work, the work we do even is automated within 20 years.
808, anytime you get a big productivity boost, it's fantastic and it comes quickly.
809
And yes, that can solve problems.
810
I will say that historically, there have been lots of times when countries have had good growth, even higher than their interest rate, and they still get into trouble because fiscal policy is not mechanical.
811
It's political.
812, how much do you spend?
813, who wants what?
814
It's not an arithmetic question.
815
Let me say this another way.
816
Nobody ever defaulted or had high inflation because of arithmetic, because they couldn't pay, because you couldn't have called in someone to know what to do.
817
They do it because of these political pressures.
818
And I think if AGI came that fast and that big, it would make the populism phenomenon that we're facing now seem nothing.
819
If AI is going to be massively deflationary, if it makes all these goods so much cheaper, should we be printing a bunch of money to still stick to 2% inflation?
820
Or does that not matter anymore?
821
We certainly can run monetary policy the same way.
822
So you don't automatically get deflation just because some goods are going down.
823
You can do things to increase demand so that there are upward pressures on the final prices.
824
Even if the AI workers are not demanding anything, you can put a lot of demand so the firms charge a lot.
825
And not just for the services that AI is replacing, their raw minerals and all the materials that go in.
826, fundamentally, when you have productivity, it makes it easier for the monetary authorities, the Federal Reserve, to deliver low inflation and good growth.
827
That's what they're trying to do.
828
It makes their job easier.
829
And I think it takes the pressure off them somewhat to inflate because things are going pretty good.
830
And so there aren't the same pressures.
831
Right.
832
But should they be trying to fight the deflation at all in that world?
833
Because,,, we need inflation to root out of the rentiers.
834
We gotta fight downward.
835
Rage rigidity.
836
But now the AIs have all the jobs, so you don't need to worry about that.
837
There's a bunch of biases that humans have, which to get rid of, we need inflation.
838
Do we even need that in the world with AI?
839
Okay, that is a very good point.
840
Frankly, Keynes founded modern macroeconomics, and he was an incredible Renaissance person, just having both sides of the brain.
841
And one of these insights he had that just transformed things.
842
And before, we just used these what we call general equilibrium models, demand, supply, prices move to keep them into line.
843
And Keynes was looking at the Great Depression, and he said, prices should be coming down.
844
And they're not.
845
And why aren't they?
846
And that's really a cornerstone.
847
And at the end of the day, it's mostly human behavior.
848
It's mostly workers.
849
So if you have these docile AI workers, they're not workers.
850
They're just,, if you have firms that are willing to let the prices fall, you certainly can do that.
851, we're going to still have some human workers.
852
I don't know.
853
But I guess a question on what monetary policy should be is: do you think interest rates are going to go up or down?
854
When we had deflation last time from this demand and deflation, which is what happened after the financial crisis and the pandemic, interest rates went down.
855, my intuition here is that interest rates would be needing to go up, real interest rates, real inflation interest rates.
856
And then deflation is not such a problem.
857
You just don't need to let them go up as much.
858
When we were in the interest rates went to zero, basically.
859
And it's a whole nother line of discussion, but they felt they couldn't lower them into significant negative territory.
860
So they're paralyzed.
861
There's this deflation or too low inflation.
862
Monetary authorities thought they knew how to create inflation, but that's always been by cutting interest rates lower.
863
When they've hit a bottom, they don't.
864
So I have a whole book about negative interest rates, but a whole other thing.
865
But if we're imagining interest rates to go up, it's not much of a technical, real interest rates, inflation is not much of a technical problem.
866
You just let the interest rates go up a little less so that you're not getting deflation.
867
Do you expect interest rates to go up?
868
Because one factor, obviously, is you want to invest in the future.
869
The future has so much more potential.
870
Another is maybe you want to consume more now because you're going to be wealthy in the future anyways.
871
You might as well start spending as much as you can right now.
872
Trevor Burrus I think AGI and AI are upward pressures on interest rates.
873
So lots of crude reasons.
874
The huge energy needs, I should have asked you about that first,, having to provide all the energy needs.
875
And also, as you say, traditionally, when you did a lot of investment, it raised wages.
876
But it's possible, and there's economists Dara Nasi Moglu have shown it can go both ways.
877
It's not difficult to show it can go both ways.
878
If you're really just substituting for workers, it's making capital more valuable.
879
You just even invest more.
880
So it's with what the pressures on monetary policy a little bit depend on that.
881
In principle, it makes life easier.
882
If it did push things down, the interest rate down to zero, there are interesting questions around that, but maybe your audience might not be that fascinated by them as I am.
883
Well, let's talk about it a little bit.
884, if we expect interest rates to go up because of AI, what should the government be doing right now to be ready for that?
885
Should they, I don't know, should they be locking in 100-year bonds at the current interest rates because they're only going up from here.
886
So I'm going to get to it, but just where we are, I had been arguing interest rates today.
887, I follow this all the time, and maybe a lot of people who listen to you don't, but inflation-adjusted interest rates.
888
And I want to pick the 10, there's a 10-year bond that's indexed to the inflation rate that our treasury issues.
889
Inflation index is only about 10% of our total debt, but there's tax stuff, and it's not perfect, but it's a pretty good measure of what we call the real interest rate.
890
And it had gone to minus one at one point after the pandemic, at average zero for about 10 years between 2012 and 2021.
891
And it's higher now.
892
And that is, for a macroeconomist, the biggest question in the world because it affects asset prices, it affects risk, it affects volatility.
893
So the question I regard as just a normalization.
894
I think that's something that was likely to happen.
895
If you were to go around, talk to my younger colleagues or at other places, there's quite a debate about that.
896
There's a lot of people who think we're getting old, we're not inventing anything.
897
I know you're just debating against that, and good for you, but, that it's the, but I tend to think interest rates are more likely to go up than down going forward.
898
And I'm talking about these long-term interest rates, not what the Federal Reserve does, it just sets the overnight interest rate, the market setting these long-term interest rates.
899
I think they're more likely to go up, but I think AGI is only a piece of it.
900
I think that the debts rising everywhere, the remilitarization of a lot of the world, needing to deal with climate change eventually.
901
If we're not dealing with climate change, we're dealing with climate disasters, growing populism, geopolitical fracturing, many things.
902
I tend to think interest rates are going to go up, but not just for the good reason that we've gotten more creative and everything's going to be better.
903
You say in the book that you expect a rebalancing from U.S.
904
equities to foreign equities.
905
U.S.
906
equities have been outpacing foreign stock for the last couple of decades, and you say you expect this to change or there's going to be some rebalancing.
907
What is it that causes that?
908
So I think I say very concretely is that when the dollar is really high, you should expect the Euro to go up.
909
And I feel strongly about that.
910 when my first important paper was about exchange rates, that's why the book's about exchange rates.
911
And when Japan's really weak or when the dollar is really strong, very hard to predict exchange rates, but then it is.
912
So I think the Euro will do well.
913
There's a lot of room to catch up in Europe.
914
So I think I'm nuanced in what I say in the book because Trump hadn't been elected yet.
915
But I say if Europe, Europe seems to be under pressure to remilitarize, I was aware that Harris was probably going to cut the U.S.
916
defense budget.
917
So that would put pressure on them.
918
Remilitarizing would be good for the Euro.
919
It would be good for technology in Europe.
920
It would give them more geopolitical power in the system.
921
But yeah, I do.
922
Now, I have to say, just so your listeners can calibrate this, I once,, my first book was a very mathematical book called Foundations of International Macroeconomics.
923
And,, in theory, you should diversify.
924
You shouldn't put all your money in the United States.
925
And I did a video with Bignu Brzezinski, Miko Brzezinski's father, for people who don't know who he is, but he was Carter's, he was Carter's Kissinger.
926
I did a video with him that Merrill Lynch produced, and it was about why international diversification could be good.
927
And one thing I want me to say was very, very,, limited.
928
I feel quite fine about what I said.
929
I wasn't doing any consulting at the time.
930
I just did academic work.
931
I didn't do speeches.
932
I didn't do consulting.
933
I talked to central banks a bit, but I didn't do anything for money, but I did get paid for this.
934
It circulated half a million copies of it, of this.
935
And a lot of my friends teased me and said, you would have made a lot more money if you just hadn't followed your own advice.
936
So,, and I could think of plenty of other examples that.
937
But yeah, my instinct is that,, this idea that the exhaust, what is it, our U.S.
938
premium just should get bigger and bigger and bigger.
939
These things have some regression to mean.
940
Maybe not with AI, all being in the U.S.
941
Is it because you're predicting,, does the S<unk>P keep growing at 8%, but foreign equities do even better?
942
I'm just going to safely say foreign equity is doing better.
943
But not because the growth in U.S.
944
equity slows down.
945
It's just that they do even better.
946
Or is it that U.S.
947
equity slow down?
948, look, you have a lot of friends who spend all their time doing this, and I wouldn't pretend to.
949
I hold a very neutral portfolio because I talk to policymakers and world leaders even on occasion.
950
And I don't want to be someone who's talking about regulating Bitcoin and owning a lot of Bitcoin, not to pick a random example.
951
And so I wouldn't regard myself as great at this.
952, I just,, but yes, I think there's a case for international diversification, particularly into Europe at this point, because they have so much potential catch up.
953
There's some, just as in, I think, California, where you're from, there's a little bit of dim awareness that it might be over-regulated and you might do things differently.
954
I think I feel that's happening in Europe.
955
If you look at internationally, if you had been betting on catch-up, I wonder if you'd backtest that because there's some intuition.
956
Well, if you're poorer than the frontier, it makes sense that it would be easy for you to catch up.
957
There's another intuition that if you've been persistently behind the frontier, there must be some deep endogenous reason why you.
958
Yeah, no, you're absolutely right.
959
So, for example, Asia has a lot more governance problems, I would say, on the whole.
960
And there's a reason that their price-earnings ratios are lower because you don't trust the governance.
961
You're right.
962
You're right.
963, so that's fair.
964
And, a lot of people are just betting on that.
965
But,,, I think Europe's not so hopeless that it can't pull it together.
966
I make the comparison.
967
I'm a basketball fan.
968
The Boston Celtics just got crushed by the Knicks as we just before we're taping this.
969, part of it is our star, Jason Tatum, was injured.
970
Well, you may not have gotten any better Europe, but if somebody's hobbling the United States, and I do think that's going on to some extent now,, you do better.
971
Yeah.
972
Is there some institutional reform we could make that would get us out of this political equilibrium we're stuck in, where both parties, when they're in power, are incentivized to increase the debt, and there's no institutional check on that proclivity?
973
There have been a lot of people tried this with, for example, having what are called fiscal councils.
974
And I have did a paper once with Julia Pollack, who's a brilliant economist.
975
You can look her up when she was an undergraduate about fiscal councils.
976
That was quite a while ago.
977
And a number of countries experimented with it, but it hasn't worked.
978
The country which has done the most with this is probably the United Kingdom.
979
George Osborne, when he was chancellor, set up this fiscal authority where the big thing they did was they made predictions.
980
So the government doesn't get to make different predictions.
981
And you don't necessarily have to go by their predictions, but they got to say whatever they think.
982
Our CBO does not get to do that quite the same.
983
Our Congressional Budget Office, they're very good, but they are constrained to believe what Congress tells them.
984
Congress says, we're putting in this tax hut, but it's going to go away after 10 years, or we're doing this policy, it's all going to change.
985
They're forced to use some of the parameters, whereas the one in the UK is more independent.
986, there are lots of complaints about it, but that's a very poor man's fiscal authority.
987
Just somebody that says, this is what your deficit looks.
988
The same things as our Congressional Budget Office does, but with more independence.
989
It helps.
990
But I think it has to go to our electoral system, right?
991
Our campaign financing.
992
Do we have term limits?
993
Well, you think that would help?
994, I think, if anything, if you were longer in office, you might have a more long-term incentive.
995, to the extent that a lot of the deficit problems are caused by populism, I don't know how much will help.
996
I don't know.
997
Maybe you're right.
998
I don't have a magical solution to this.
999
It's all over the world.
1000
Nobody's finding a particular great solution to it.
1001
The only encouraging thing is these things go in waves, and so maybe this one will end.
1002
But we're certainly in a really difficult situation right now where,, somebody asked me,, if you were advising, if you were a Republican president or something, what would you do?
1003
What problem would you face?
1004
And the biggest problem is that in a few years, there's going to be a Democratic president.
1005
They're going to do exactly the opposite of what you wanted to do.
1006
And it's the same thing for the Democratic presidents.
1007
How do you have some continuity?
1008
How do you have policies put in place that the public can rely on?
1009
We've done well in the United States in some ways because our government's been weak and hasn't been doing stuff.
1010
And the private sector can work around it.
1011
I'm not saying it's perfect.
1012
There are lots of things we should do.
1013
But yeah, I don't.
1014
Look, this is out of my paycheck, so to speak.
1015
You're the former chief economist of the IMF.
1016
All right.
1017
It's not your job.
1018
Who's our job?
1019
No, no, but as an economist.
1020
No,, these are very political.
1021, I think Brexit's an example of democracy gone amok.
1022
What a dumb idea.
1023
Maybe, I won't say, I don't know if Brexit was right or wrong.
1024
Okay, we'll know in 50 years.
1025
But you shouldn't be able to do it with a simple majority vote.
1026
You should need a two-thirds vote or something that.
1027
There are a lot of, I whole government department here with people specializing in what we should do.
1028
And, I think there are experiments.
1029
Washington State experimented with different voting choices.
1030
Maine did.
1031
There are these ideas out there, but we're a long ways from converging on anything.
1032
If you think people are underrating how big the debt issue is, are you, especially along countries which have a low debt to GDP ratio, Australia or Norway?
1033
Well, it's not the only thing going on in the world that your debt is just,, one thing.
1034
Countries certainly Australia and Canada are examples.
1035
They're what we call commodity exports.
1036
They know that sometimes the sun shines and sometimes it's a dark winter.
1037
They know they don't quite sell oil, but they sell some coal, natural gas, and some oil.
1038
They know things move around.
1039
They know they need to save for a rainy day.
1040
Norway is just in a whole nother league.
1041
Yeah,, there are lots of factors to whether a country is going to do well, and the lower debt countries have less of a problem.
1042
But Canada, Australia are commodity exporters and face very volatile income streams.
1043
So they tend to be more nervous about debt.
1044
By the way, they have a lot of housing debt in Canada, for example.
1045
That's been a big problem.
1046
But I'm bullish on the United States.
1047, don't misunderstand me.
1048
I'm not saying,, everyone should leave the United States and go to Canada.
1049
Although my wife thinks that sometimes, but for other reasons.
1050
I have to mention when I was playing chess in the late 1960s, I was living by myself in Europe, and Nixon got elected.
1051
And I felt about Nixon the way I think a lot of people in your generation, or at least the millennials, think about Trump.
1052
And I didn't want to come back to the United States.
1053
So there are a lot of people who talk about that, but I think the United States is great.
1054
But I think countries which are smaller, they're not the reserve currency, they don't have access to these deep,, pockets of domestic and foreign borrowers, and all those countries fit into that framework.
1055
They need to be more careful.
1056
Do you think we were put this exorbitant privilege as you talk about?
1057
Is it possible that one way in which it's bad for us is that it allows or incentivizes us to take on more debt than it's wise to?
1058
And especially if this is not a permanent advantage we have that,, when you're at the top, you take out this cheap debt, and then over time you lose your reserve status, or it weakens at least, and you have to refinance that debt at higher interest rates.
1059
And so, in the short term, you're incentivizing this behavior, which is not sustainable in the long run.
1060
So, is there some political economy explanation for why this is bad for us?
1061
Yeah,, I've heard that argument, but I basically think it's great for us.
1062
It's not just the government, it's all of us borrow less.
1063
And do we wish we were paying higher interest rates?
1064, probably most people who are getting a mortgage right now feel our interest rates are plenty high.
1065
They don't need to see them higher.
1066
I think the exorbitant privilege, there are some drawbacks we don't need to get into, but it's basically incredibly fantastic.
1067
If you owe $37 trillion, as our government does, to be paying half a percent to a percent less, we're talking hundreds of billions of dollars.
1068
Our ability to see what's going on everywhere.
1069
A lot of what our spying does is using our exorbitant privilege and the dollar network.
1070
Our sanctions, I mentioned,, I was in my teens at the end of the 1960s.
1071
I didn't want to come back.
1072
One reason I didn't want to come back was the Vietnam War was pretty terrifying.
1073
I had many friends get drafted.
1074
Their brains got fried by heroin, even if they didn't get killed.
1075
And sanctions, I'm not saying that we solved all our wars with sanctions, but make no mistake.
1076
We have used that in place of military intervention a few times.
1077
So that's been great.
1078
And I think losing that and not appreciating how important that Is a terrible blunder that we might be making right now.
1079
This is a very naive question, and I know you address it at length in your book, but just to get a very, I'll ask the question in the most straightforward way, and then you can explain what's going on.
1080
How should I think about the fact that we are basically giving the rest of the world pieces of paper and we're getting real goods and services in exchange?
1081, sure, there's this at the high level, you can say that they're getting this liquidity or they're getting this network, and that's what makes it worth it.
1082
But, I don't know, are we fundamentally getting away with something?
1083
So just to note, the United Kingdom's not the reserve currency.
1084
They're not the dominant currency.
1085
It used to be,, 100 years ago.
1086
They're not.
1087
And they look a lot us with big current account deficits.
1088
They're one of the countries.
1089
That's why Trump was able to strike a deal with them because they weren't really running a surplus against us anyway.
1090
They're over-financialized even much more than we are.
1091
So the core of the benefit we get is that we borrow safe assets, if you want to call our debt safe, and we invest in risky stuff.
1092
And that's Charles Kindleberger, who wrote one of the great books on crises.
1093
I had him,, as a professor at MIT.
1094
He called us bankers to the world.
1095
He said, yep, we're running this deficit.
1096
They're holding a lot of our treasury bills.
1097
We are making money hand over fist.
1098
It's the same thing as the equity premium, where you hold stocks not always, but on average, it's better than handling bonds.
1099
So that's been very good, having the fact that dollars use very liquid the markets.
1100
So you're, let's just say, a Silicon Valley firm, but big enough to issue debt internationally.
1101
I don't know if any Silicon Valley firms ever issue debt, but if you did,, some firm and you're issuing debt, people will buy it because it's in dollars.
1102
If you're the same firm in France, forget it.
1103
They don't want to hold Euros.
1104
And even if you promise to pay in dollars, they're not happy about it because your income's not in dollars.
1105
So it's been fantastic.
1106
This is something that's been debated.
1107
Steve Moran, who was a Harvard student, Harvard PhD, has made an argument.
1108
It's quite clever.
1109
He's the head of Trump's Council of Economic Advisors.
1110
He's a very smart guy.
1111
He's made this very clever argument that because everybody loves our currency, it makes us less competitive in everything else.
1112
It's partly hollowed out our manufacturing, and that's terrible.
1113, there's a little bit of truth to that.
1114
First of all, the dollar goes this, so it's not always high.
1115
Second of all, I mentioned the United Kingdom's in the same boat.
1116
We're good at a lot of things.
1117
We're good at tech.
1118
Tech makes the dollar stronger, make no mistake.
1119
We're good at biotech.
1120
We're good at agriculture.
1121
We're good at a lot of things that make the dollar high.
1122
And if you're good at these other things, it's harder to be good in manufacturing.
1123
It bids up the cost of everything and the price.
1124
So,, on the whole, we're performing this banking function.
1125
That's really the big thing.
1126
This has gone on for really in the 50s, the 60s.
1127
It's gone on for a long time.
1128
And that's the core of our so-called exorbitant privilege.
1129
There's a really interesting book by Charles Mann, I think, called 1493, about how during Ming Dynasty China, 17th century, they kept issuing different paper currencies and it was super unstable.
1130
And so people in China wanted a reliable medium of exchange.
1131
And so tens of thousands of tons of silver from the New World, from the Spanish, would be exchanged for,, enormous amounts of real goods that were exported from China.
1132
And so from the Spanish perspective, they're getting,, shiploads and shiploads of real goods.
1133
All they're giving up is this medium of exchange.
1134
I don't know.
1135
I don't know how analogous it is to this situation.
1136
There are countries Ecuador and others that dollarize.
1137
They literally use the dollar and they need the dollars.
1138
And we're able to have them hold dollars.
1139
It's not silver, but we print it and they pay very low interest rates.
1140
They're holding treasury bills, they're not holding dollars.
1141
And it's fantastic for us.
1142
We definitely pay less on our debt because of that.
1143
And that's a fascinating example you bring up.
1144, the Chinese invented the printing press.
1145
They invented paper currency way before the Europeans.
1146
But then,, what do?
1147
They kept printing a lot of it and had a lot of inflation.
1148
And I hadn't read that book, and that's a great example.
1149
I knew they were using silver, but I didn't.
1150
That number's bigger than I knew, than I'd heard.
1151
Final question.
1152
A big part of your book discusses the different countries which seemed at different times to be real competitors to America.
1153
You talk about the Soviet Union, Japan, China today.
1154
And we've discussed why they didn't pan out.
1155
And we can go into the details on any one of those examples.
1156
But big picture, is there some explanation that generalizes across all these examples of why America has been so competitive or why it's been so hard to displace?
1157
So it's not just that we've stayed on top.
1158
We've just gone this.
1159
We have, remember, after,, in the 1970s, Europe peeled away from the dollar block.
1160
But the rest of the world started globalizing.
1161
China globalized.
1162
Eventually, the Soviet Union.
1163
And the dollar just colonized all these places.
1164
They were all holding dollar debt using dollars.
1165
That was much bigger than even the British pound was when the sun never set on the British Empire.
1166
And so it's been amazing and surprising, I think, to people myself, if you read what everyone was saying at the time was just that it kept going up, that our share of everything kept getting bigger and bigger.
1167
And I think definitely to some extent we've been lucky.
1168
We talked about Japan.
1169
I think China made a big mistake with sticking to the dollar so long.
1170
Europe should have delayed bringing Greece into the Euro because their crisis wouldn't have been so bad.
1171
So I think we've been fortunate by blunders, by our opposition.
1172
We've done some good things.
1173
But I think the thing Americans forget is we have been lucky at a lot of times.
1174
I worry our luck is wearing thin.
1175
So I quote a chess player, the great Bent Larson, who was the number two to Bobby Fisher when I was playing.
1176
And he was asked, would you rather be lucky or good in a chess game?
1177
And he said, both.
1178
And I think Americans forget, they know we're good.
1179
And we are good that we've talked about the dynamism, this secret sauce that we have so far.
1180
But I think we've also been lucky if you ran it all again, it didn't have to go the same way.
1181
Well, it's a very scary luck because if it's so easy for these other countries to make some mistake that causes them to totally fall behind, it should update you in the favor that, in general, it's easy for a country to get itself in a rut.
1182
It's the Fermi estimate thing of the fact that you don't see other alien civilizations is very scary because it suggests that there's some filter which makes it really hard to see the civilization going.
1183
Yeah, well, I hope not, but we'll see.
1184
But it's certainly been amazing how the dollar's done and how the U.S.
1185
has done.
1186
And I hope we continue.
1187
But we're doing a lot of things right now.
1188
I don't think Trump is the cause of the dollar being in gentle decline.
1189
That's just wrong.
1190
I think it would have happened with Harris winning.
1191
But he is the president at the moment.
1192
And things Liberation Day.
1193
And I've talked to tech people who think it's just brilliant.
1194
I understand that.
1195
Okay, we can debate it.
1196
I'm happy to debate it with them.
1197
We look at the rule of law.
1198
Okay, I'm sitting at Harvard University.
1199
Naturally, it feels that way.
1200
But also, we talked about getting rid of the head, having the president be able to get rid of all the independent agencies.
1201
Used to be: if you were a foreign investor, you invest in the United States, you thought you'd get your money back.
1202
Maybe the stock would have gone down.
1203
Maybe the real estate you bought would have gone down, but you get paid.
1204
And I think we were more exceptional than most about that.
1205
And,, it's in doubt now.
1206
There's not any question.
1207
When I was telling people about the book, and the book's about a lot of things besides exorbitant privilege, the whole arc of the U.S., but I was telling them, I don't know, I'm looking at the numbers.
1208
I'm looking at what China's doing.
1209
I'm reading about Europe and their central bank digital currency.
1210
I think we're going downhill.
1211
And I showed it to academics.
1212
I showed it to financial people, showed it to tech people.
1213
They said, you're nuts.
1214, they didn't want to think about it.
1215
And I don't know if I'm right, but I think we're thinking about it.
1216
When I was in China, I met up with some venture capitalists there, and they were quite depressed in general.
1217
And even founders say that it's hard to raise money.
1218
And I was asking them why.
1219
And they said that investors don't want to invest because even if you invest in the next Alibaba, who's to say the government doesn't cancel the IPO?
1220
They're in trouble.
1221
I think Europe has a bright future in this context of being the team that doesn't have as many injured players.
1222
But yeah, China, it's not going to be forever, but I think five or 10 years that they're going to stay in trouble.
1223
Okay.
