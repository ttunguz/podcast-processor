1
Really the secret we had discovered is that if you commit a nonviolent crime, you have a nine in ten chance of getting away with it.
2
Oh, I was there with the police chief, hung up a camera on one of their busiest roads, and within the first hour, stolen car drives by.
3
No way.
4
Every single flight I take to LA generate roughly $50,000 of AR.
5
Welcome, everyone, to the I.O.
6
podcast.
7
We're stoked to have Garrett Langley here with Sterling and I today.
8
Most of you probably know who Garrett is.
9
Garrett's the founder and CEO of Flock Safety, which is, I don't know, Sterling and I were debating.
10
It's, you know, one of the top few privately held startups in the world today.
11
You guys are doing incredibly well, and we're excited to go a little deep with you on how you build the business.
12
Thanks for joining us, man.
13
Yeah, thanks for having me.
14
It's good to see you.
15
It's Trading Places.
16
I know you joined our all hands not too long ago, so it's the least I could do.
17
Yeah, that was fun.
18
We had a good time.
19
So I mentioned this to you, Garrett, over email, but we've got two goals here.
20
One is to give like very tactical, candid advice to other founders who listen to this.
21
We think other podcasts do a good job of like VC and late stage advice, but we want to kind of go into the nitty-gritty details of operating a little bit.
22
And the second is to help you guys get your name out to candidates across the country who, or world, I guess, who may want to join.
23
So let's jump into it.
24
For anyone who is not familiar with Flock Safety, what do you do?
25
Who are you?
26
Yep.
27
Yeah.
28
So the people of Flock, myself included, have this fundamental belief that everyone deserves the right to thrive.
29
And if you look at that, whether you're talking about a human or a community, that ability to do better than your than your parents is predicated off of a bedrock of safety.
30
Like you look at the countries, the communities that are really struggling, right?
31
And we can pick on our friends in San Francisco and Oakland for a second.
32
When safety was eroded, everything started to fall apart.
33
And now the cool thing is like San Francisco brought Flock in and it's actually on the up and up.
34
Which I'm happy to take a little bit of credit for helping out a pretty important city in America.
35
But I'd say like that, that is our North Star, which is what will it take in some combination of technology, people, and policy so that everyone has the right to thrive.
36
And what does that actually mean though, right?
37
It's like we build a combination of hardware, software, and AI products to help communities eliminate crime.
38
And when I say community, that spans major enterprises, you know, some of the biggest companies in the world to the biggest cities, to also the smallest cities.
39
Like I know, you know, your hometown, Tyler, is a is a flock customer, and I don't think the population is that big.
40
Probably a nice mid-sized city for Utah.
41
And I think that's important to us is from a town of a thousand to a town of a million to 10 million and up, we want everyone to have the same right.
42
How did you come up with the idea, Garrett?
43
What's the insight?
44
Where did it come from?
45
Yeah, and I'm hoping you got mugged when you were at the tender age of 12 and it spurred this like you wanted to be Batman.
46
Because it is really cool, but yeah, I'm the same as Tyler's.
47
Like, where did the insight come from and why?
48
Yeah, no, I think, Serling, it's a good question.
49
I think that, so like, I've heard VCs use this framework before, and I think it's applicable to founders.
50
Like, you know, what's more important?
51
The product, the market, or the team.
52
I'm in like camp team.
53
I think great teams build great products, find big markets.
54
And like, if you have a crappy team in a big market, well, the market's going to change.
55
The team's going to be pretty consistent.
56
And so for us, I knew who I want to start a company with.
57
They had worked for me at a prior company I started as Matt and Paige here in Atlanta with me.
58
So the three of us would get together every single night and start talking about problems that we wanted to solve.
59
And the only really filter we put on ourselves was we didn't want to build another Martech, FinTech, dopey company that doesn't actually do anything.
60
I think I've heard, you know, Trey Stevens has talked about this a lot of like, you got to pick an important journey.
61
I fully subscribe to that.
62
Like life's too short.
63
Choose good quests.
64
Yes, good quests.
65
Thank you.
66
And so we were in that camp, but we looked at like, we looked at toilets, we looked at time.
67
Time's an interesting problem.
68
Like it's hard to get it back once you lose it.
69
And one of the problems we looked at was crime.
70
And really the secret we had discovered was the national average is that if you commit a nonviolent crime, you have a nine in 10 chance of getting away with it.
71
Oh.
72
It's like I'm going to go steal your car tonight, Sterling.
73
And I'm obviously top quartile because everyone believes they're top quartile.
74
No one's average.
75
So I don't even think my chances are nine in 10.
76
I think my chances are like 95 out of 100 that I get away with it.
77
And if you look at the average criminal, they're like 16 to 22 years old.
78
If you reflect back when you were that age, you were even more confident in your abilities to get away with anything.
79
And so we looked at that and just kept poking on the question of like, why?
80
Like, why is it so easy?
81
And the homicide clearance rates are not much better.
82
Like, it's pretty easy to get away with killing someone, sadly.
83
So you look at that and you go, well, what's the why?
84
And one argument would be apathy.
85
Like, there's just, there's no energy to go solve the crime.
86
But what we found is that it was a lack of evidence.
87
Like, and then if you could solve that, it would be quite interesting.
88
Now, to your root question, though, like, my neighborhood was the victim of quite organized crime.
89
That's why the idea kind of like got thrown into the melting pot of like, well, maybe we should go be you know crime fighters.
90
And for my team, it was the only problem we were looking at where none of us were like, oh, that's going to be miserable for a decade.
91
Like, one of my co-founders wanted to do a music startup, and I was like, that's going to be miserable.
92
Music stars don't make any money.
93
Paige wanted to do something in healthcare.
94
And I was like, oh, I don't want to do that for a decade of my life.
95
It's a crime wound up being the only one that no one hated.
96
So this is interesting.
97
Tyler and I debate this a lot.
98
We kind of, in most of the companies that get big, they are born out of, you know, you were doing a job, you were a construction worker, and you noticed a specific problem.
99
This like idea of basically getting on the whiteboard with two co-founders and sort of, we always call it like MBAing a business where you kind of like go through analysis and you have lots of ideas.
100
It usually doesn't work.
101
Like, why do you think this was different?
102
Well, I would say the last three companies I've started, Flock Included, have all started the same way, which is like pick a great team and then like just coalesce around an idea and really more of a customer.
103
And so I guess I do fall into that mindset that it's easier to fall in love with a customer and then find their problems.
104
And like building technology is not that hard.
105
It's like much harder to fall in love with a customer, I think, and like stick it out.
106
So I don't know.
107
I've never built a company that I have an experience in.
108
I've never had a real job.
109
So I guess it'd be hard for me to go build a company that's relevant to some job I had.
110
But I also think there are MBA ways to go about it, right?
111
Like I'm a fan of the Peter Teal mantra of like, go build a monopoly.
112
And look at my space that I'm in.
113
The last company to go public was started 43 years ago, my space.
114
Yeah, wild.
115
There's no competition.
116
Garrett, by the way, the reason for that NBA thing, I think, is not just because it's an NBA on a whiteboard, but because it means that maybe there's not an insight.
117
But that's the root reason: if anyone can come up with it, then maybe there's no insight.
118
But I actually think it's worth diving into it here because, yeah, you guys were smart people with a proverbial whiteboard, but it does sound like you might have actually uncovered an insight that the market had not uncovered that you were getting to.
119
Do you agree with that?
120
I would actually argue that we were incredibly loose on what the product did and what customer we served.
121
And we're very focused on this problem of like, why is crime so easy to do?
122
And so I think, Tony, like, if you look at our seed deck, we actually only had one slide.
123
And it was a mugshot of a person that our kind of like initial prototype had put in jail.
124
And I remember Gary Tan and Alexis, when they were running initialized, they let our seed.
125
They were like, what do you do?
126
And I'm like, that's not why I think you should invest in this company.
127
You should invest in this company if you think that this should happen.
128
If you think that if you commit a crime, you should be held accountable.
129
I'm going to go solve that problem ruthlessly.
130
And the original pitch was to sell to property managers.
131
We have zero property managers as customers.
132
The next pitch was to sell to neighborhoods.
133
That's like 10%, 15% of our revenue.
134
Like, nowhere in our pitch deck in the first four years of the company was it like we're going to service the largest retailers in the world.
135
No way.
136
But like they have a big crime problem.
137
It's like we just kind of stumbled our way.
138
It's like, oh, like that's a problem for them.
139
So this is fascinating because you still end up in the idea maze.
140
You just get started at a little bit of a different point than most founders normally do.
141
Would you think that's fair, Garrett?
142
Yeah, I think so because I don't know.
143
I think it is really hard to build an innovative company in an industry that you have experience in.
144
Like, I think it's really hard.
145
Because you're too smart.
146
Like, you know of all the reasons not to do it.
147
Yeah, curse of knowledge.
148
Yeah.
149
Like, if someone had explained to me how hard it is to sell stuff to local government, I would have said it's a horrible idea.
150
It's a really bad idea on paper.
151
But like, we didn't know any better.
152
So we just started doing it and just kind of brute forced through pain and sweat.
153
By the way, we're going to get to that on how you did that.
154
But before we do, I want to ask you to brag a little, Garret.
155
Can you share a stat or two or three with the listeners of like what you're most proud of the Flock Safety is doing?
156
Maybe it's revenue, maybe it's crime solved, maybe it's something.
157
Yeah.
158
So we, I talk a lot to our employee-based new people that like, I have two goals for every person that works at Flock.
159
And if I'm successful, I'll give you one of them.
160
And if I'm uber successful, I'll give you two of them.
161
And one of is like, I want to be a place that defines your career.
162
Like, I want to be a bend in your career arc where everything after Flock is like, oh man, I got so lucky I was there at that time.
163
Look where I am now.
164
So we'll talk about that.
165
And the second one is just impact.
166
Like, I also want to be a place that for the rest of your life, you will tell your friends and family of the stories from your time at Flock and the impact you had on other people's lives.
167
So on the first, you know, I think I don't know how public this is, but we went from 1 million to 100 million of ARR in three and a half years.
168
That's pretty fast.
169
That's pretty fast.
170
Like, look, I'm not Wiz.
171
I would love to be Wiz.
172
They built something incredible.
173
But like, let's call it top 10, top 15, top 20.
174
And like, we did it in, we did it with hardware, selling to local government in Atlanta.
175
So I feel like that's like three versions of hard mode.
176
So I'd say I'm most proud of the team that got us there.
177
And I'd say the good news is like growth is accelerating and like we have a pretty clear line of sight for the future of the company.
178
So that's probably number one on the revenue side.
179
I think on the impact side, I was talking to a candidate recently and I had made the observation that, you know, this is a Nielsen type analysis, but probably roughly 20% of all U.S.
180
crime is solved using a Flock product.
181
And they were like, that's BS.
182
There's no way.
183
All U.S.
184
crime, 25%.
185
20%, 20%.
186
And she was like, she was like, no way.
187
And I was like, I'm not lying to you.
188
But more than 50%, close to 70% of cities rely on Flock at this point.
189
Not in full scale.
190
We've got quite a bit of growth still.
191
And I have the data.
192
I have the efficacy data.
193
And I can just do simple math and show you that roughly 3,000 to 4,000 arrests a day start with Flock.
194
And I can show you the court cases at the federal, state, and local level where our evidence is, I can back this up.
195
And she was like, no way.
196
And I was like, I don't, I need to maybe build a better brand to publicly.
197
But like, the facts are there.
198
And it's pretty cool.
199
Like, we're a very nationally operational company, but very local in the sense of how we go to market.
200
And so if you live in some of these places, like people like Castle Rock, Colorado, we're like a name brand there.
201
But like, you know, Denver's a big city.
202
We're a really big impact to Denver, but Castle Rock really knows us.
203
Boulder really knows us.
204
So, you know, it just depends.
205
All right, let's get into some nitty-gritty stuff on how you build the business.
206
And I think I'll kick it off with one that you hinted at earlier, which is how the hell did you sell to these law enforcement agencies early on when you yourself had no clue how to do that?
207
You didn't even know it was your target customer.
208
How'd you get your first 10 is maybe my direct question?
209
Yeah.
210
It's really interesting.
211
I have this very visceral memory.
212
I was in San Francisco.
213
I was having breakfast with Jeff Lewis and Bedrock.
214
IL podcast guest number four, I believe.
215
It was one of the funnest combos we've had.
216
Yeah, he's a character.
217
And I had pitched the day before to the board: you know, hey, I want to go aggressively into local law enforcement.
218
And my pitch was like, I'm going to go hire this world-class sales leader.
219
They're going to go build a team of SDRs and AEs.
220
And like, you know, it's the classic go-to-market pitch.
221
And in very classic Jeff framing, he's like, Garrett, it's a horrible idea.
222
You will fail.
223
You need to pick up a bag and just go start booking deals.
224
And like, that might be obvious, right?
225
But it's very rare that a VC like sits you down and like tells it to you straight.
226
It's easier to be founder-friendly and just say, like, yeah, that's a great plan, Garrett.
227
Good luck.
228
And his advice, though, was like, don't go do it in Atlanta because no one's going to give you credit for that.
229
And so I started flying every Sunday to Los Angeles.
230
And I'd spend three days a week there, just driving to random cities in LA, cold emailing, showing up at police chiefs' offices, being like, I'm from Flock.
231
You never heard of me.
232
Can I give you a demo?
233
At the same time, one of my early employees, Bailey, was doing that in San Francisco.
234
Sorry, not San Francisco, in Houston.
235
It's like every Sunday we'd fly out, we'd spend three days there, like classic cold calling, like traveling salesman with a bag in our hands.
236
And like the interesting thing that we figured out, to your point, is that these guys don't get cold called that often.
237
Yeah, they're desperate.
238
Not like a CMO or a CEO of a tech startup where it's like, my inbox is just spam.
239
And we were showing up in person with a physical product that we could show.
240
We could hang it up on a tree or hang up a pole and be like, let's go catch some bad guys.
241
And where we got kind of, you know, lightning in a bottle is we'd go put the camera up on a busy street.
242
And so take somewhere like Walnut, California, one of our first customers.
243
I was there with the police chief, hung up a camera on one of their busiest roads, and within the first hour, stolen car drives by.
244
No way.
245
And I'm like, do you want to just go get, should we go, should we go get them?
246
Like, right?
247
And then it's pretty easy to end the conversation with, like, well, do you want me just to send you an invoice and I can leave the camera here?
248
And like, most chiefs said yes.
249
And so one of the cool things, I remember very vividly at the next board meeting being able to say, like, hey, every single flight I take to LA, I generate roughly $50,000 of AR.
250
And like that, that starts to begin like your repeatable sales motion of like, okay, well, if I could do it, maybe 30, 30,000 a week is the right target for someone that like, you know, isn't the founder.
251
But yeah, it was just brute force, nothing special.
252
If you had handed it off to a sales leader, would Jeff have been right that you would have failed?
253
Totally.
254
Totally.
255
Because how many at-scale SaaS companies do you know whose predominant go-to-market is boots on the ground door-to-door sales?
256
It's not common anymore.
257
I mean, some of the people in y'all's backyard, like Vivet, did that.
258
Like, that was a really successful motion for them.
259
But, like, okay, I found one.
260
So, Garrett, the company that I'm a CEO of, we do the same thing.
261
Everyone's on planes three days a week in territory, showing up to people who don't get a lot of people showing up.
262
And it's magic.
263
It's hard.
264
It's hard.
265
But like, it's magic.
266
No, I mean, you, you, Cerlin, I don't know how big your sales team is.
267
It's hard to find people that want to do that anymore.
268
It's way easier to have be an inside AE with three SDRs, like, but they're out there.
269
They're just hard to find.
270
And whenever someone's touched, you know, just inbound, they don't want to go do that motion anymore.
271
They're all trying to get away from it.
272
And, but, but it is truly a magical motion, one that I always preach gets more valuable as time goes on, as things get more and more automated.
273
Like, showing up in person with your box of cookies is going to be something that people just don't want to do.
274
I mean, no, I think to that point, I still travel probably 80% of the weeks of the year.
275
Do you, I know Tyler spoke at your company meeting, and one of the things that he was talking about is he referenced some type of a goal that you have for weekly, you know, customer-prospect interactions.
276
Is that something that's like codified, or is that just something you sort of strive for?
277
On a personal level, I interact with a customer every single day.
278
I don't know if a day has passed that I've run the company that I have not on a one-on-one basis interact with a customer.
279
Like, I had three customer meetings already today and all of them in person.
280
And I think the executive team embodies that same thing, whether you're the CTO or the CRO, it doesn't matter.
281
Like, I think it's very hard to build a successful company without a level of customer obsession.
282
That feels kind of strange.
283
It's why, and this is very intuitive, but it's why Jeff was right.
284
If you hand this stuff off, you don't get the product feedback you need.
285
And you're the founder.
286
You're calling all the shots at the end of the day.
287
That feedback loop has to be instantaneous.
288
And then if you can't make something repeatable, you don't have the product market fit.
289
You need to keep iterating and iterating and iterating.
290
And it's so tempting to want to outsource it.
291
And it's like, well, I get a rep and/ I get a great, I get a great sales leader.
292
It just doesn't work.
293
But it's a tempting idea because who wants to get on a plane to LA on Sunday night every week for long periods of time?
294
It's just hard.
295
What I think early on, too, and I didn't come up with this idea, but I definitely abused it and stretched it as long as I could is like fully subscribed to the idea of like a sales assistant.
296
And like our early AEs were really glorified sales assistants for me.
297
And that actually worked really well.
298
It was like I could go do the pitch, they could learn directly from me.
299
They would own all the follow-up and finish, which is still not easy, not guaranteed, but really like up until we probably had 30 or 40 sales reps in the field, I would spend a lot of time with the new reps in the field for their first month, helping them book meetings, give the demo, push the product.
300
And I think that was really important.
301
How much of your learnings from doing that made their way into the product?
302
Like what percent of what Flock is today do you think came from those interactions?
303
Yeah, so I'm fortunate that I'm a technical founder.
304
So, I mean, I'd be writing code in between meetings.
305
Like, I got to go make this change, right?
306
So, I mean, look, I'd have to look at GitHub to see, you know, what percentage of my code is still out there.
307
I know that the engineering team revoked my access to GitHub a couple years ago, which was a painful graduation point for me.
308
Because, I mean, I would like push code on the master brand straight to production.
309
So I'm like, I don't have bugs.
310
I'm fine.
311
Not a healthy way to run a company long term.
312
But no, I mean, pretty, pretty material.
313
It's like we just go spend time with our customers and then change the product on the fly.
314
And we still do that today as a company.
315
It's just less me.
316
Like, I'm a huge fan of get three engineers in a PM on a plane and let them go spend a day with a customer and like build product right there with them.
317
I do think that's one of the core insights of the sales thing we're talking about, the founder sales motion, which is that it's actually indistinguishable from product management.
318
That's what good product management is: is selling, basically.
319
Yeah.
320
And then building it.
321
All right.
322
I would love to get a few hardware lessons, Garrett.
323
What are some of the mistakes you've made or top lessons you've learned having to ship a hardware product tied to software?
324
I know that's openly a vague question and we can go more specific, but do you have anything you'd share for hardware founders?
325
Yeah.
326
I remember Eric from Pebble shared this point of view that he feels like one of the he articulates the failure point for Pebble was how hard it is to forecast consumer demand and then the working capital required.
327
And like it's just really expensive with a lot of unavoidable risk.
328
And so I think the thing that we were intentional about is making sure that the products we deployed, our bill of materials was incredibly small compared to the revenue of the product.
329
Doesn't necessarily mean that our gross margin is 99%.
330
I'm not saying that.
331
I'm saying the bill of materials, which is where you have to put working capital, where you have to put capex.
332
And so like we're fortunate that, you know, if you look at a bill of material ratio to even ARR, it's multiple X.
333
And if you look at it on like a TCO or a TCV of a customer, it's probably 10 to 20 X.
334
And so we still have all types of gross margin, you know, headwinds as a hardware company that's digging holes and is processing billions of hours of video a day.
335
But that was probably the biggest learning was that if you're going to go down a hardware-enabled SaaS business, it's very easy to become upside down on your working capital if you're not thoughtful about it.
336
And also not thoughtful about prepayment.
337
And so, you know, we're fortunate that our customers pay upfront, often for the full life of their contract.
338
So from a free cash flow.
339
Was that hard to convince them of, Garrett?
340
Or is that just kind of a natural ask?
341
Like, did you have to work hard to get that upfront payment?
342
I mean, people like to pay as little as possible.
343
And we just looked at our own balance sheet and said, like, we can't finance.
344
Even today, even with a really, we have a lot of cash on hand, we raised a bunch of money.
345
It still is prudent to force the customer to say, hey, like, you got to pay up front.
346
I got to do all this work.
347
I got to dig the hole.
348
I got to install the camera.
349
I got to build the camera.
350
I'm going to manufacture it.
351
I got to ship it.
352
Like, you're going to pay me as soon as service is delivered.
353
And then I think the other thing too, Tyler, that, like, you know, maybe my engineering teams would disagree with me.
354
We treated hardware development like software until like we couldn't.
355
And on some of our products, we don't anymore.
356
But for most of our products, because of the business model we developed, you know, I think Peloton did a pretty good job of this too.
357
Our customers have no idea what version of the camera they're on.
358
They think they have the flock camera.
359
We're on version like 4.6 or whatever.
360
If you look at Peloton the same way, you'll notice these slight design changes depending on what time of year and what year you bought your Peloton, but you still get the Peloton bike.
361
Now they do major changes.
362
I think they've done two bikes in total.
363
But I think you run a risk if you try to copy Apple and say, like, oh, we're going to ship a major update every single year.
364
It's like, oh, that's really hard, particularly when you're early on.
365
And so we did all the things that people said were wrong.
366
We hand-built every single camera.
367
We had our PCBs manufactured.
368
We weren't like hand-etching PCBs, but everything was built by hand for the first probably thousand cameras.
369
And I think that was smart because we optimized for rapid iteration, not for ease of building or anything else.
370
At your other companies, did any of them have a hardware element or was Flock the first one?
371
Flock was the first one.
372
Well, you know, congratulations.
373
But that, that, so that's how did you think about the role of venture?
374
And did you think about it differently because you knew Flock had this hardware component?
375
And by the way, when Flock was doing this, the conventional, when you first started, the conventional wisdom is, you know, venture doesn't touch this stuff.
376
Like, we want high margin set, you know, like it was just very different.
377
But how did you think about raising money for Flock being a first-time hardware founder?
378
Yeah, I mean, I remember sitting down with Matt and Page, and I was like, look, if this thing works, we're going to wind up raising probably like a billion dollars or something crazy.
379
Like, it's just going to get more and more expensive.
380
It's not going to get cheaper.
381
And like eventually it'll asymptote out because our burn is linearly correlated to our growth rate.
382
Like most companies get efficiency through like scale.
383
We get efficiency through like slower growth, which is counterintuitive, but actually quite well fitting for venture.
384
Like, oh, you need more money to fashion your growing?
385
That's great for us.
386
Like, let's buy some more equity.
387
So we kind of knew it.
388
We chose to never take on working capital debt or lines of credit.
389
It just didn't, it didn't feel right for us.
390
But no, we assumed like venture was the only option if we wanted to go fast.
391
On the venture point, you've been fortunate and obviously deserving of some of the best investors in the world.
392
For those who aren't familiar, and you can correct me if I'm wrong, Garrett, but I think Initialize seeded it.
393
And then the A was it Matrix.
394
And then you've got Andreessen Horowitz, and then Jeff from Bedrock, and I'm sure many others that I'm missing.
395
I mean, these are people that we have on our podcast that Sterling and I both admire.
396
How did you go about picking these investors as opposed to some of the others that I'm sure you could have gone with?
397
How do you think through investor selection as a founder?
398
Well, I heard that the deck at the seed stage was mind-blowing, and so everybody, you know, he had 15,000 term sheets just from the deck alone.
399
Yeah, yeah, I wish.
400
So I think you're right.
401
We've been very fortunate that we've broadly speaking, outside of one round, had our pick.
402
You know, like we got to pick who we wanted to work with.
403
I'd say for me at least, I've never tried to price optimize.
404
So we've actually never really run a traditional process.
405
I think the adage to most operators is like, you know, build a really good deck, pitch it to 40 investors, pray you get a term sheet.
406
I don't know.
407
That just never made sense to me because I think finding an investor is closer to marriage.
408
And like, I sure didn't just like start swiping right when I found my wife.
409
Like, I picked her.
410
I was like, I'm going to marry you.
411
Like, you're the one I want to marry.
412
I remember I told her that.
413
And like, I said high commission.
414
Like, that's the woman I want to marry.
415
We've been together for 20 years.
416
So I guess I'm a good picker in that regard.
417
But I think the same thing is true on venture, which is like we identified, you know, where did we need experience?
418
Where did we want a certain event?
419
See, look at the seed round.
420
It was like, I thought the world of Gary and Alexis, I knew that before I met them.
421
And they get the term sheet was signed the same day.
422
And same with Illiad Matrix.
423
Like, I sat down with Gary and said, okay, who are your favorite Series A investors?
424
These six people.
425
I was like, okay, great.
426
Well, Ilya is an engineer.
427
He sold a company.
428
He went through YC, and he already has an opinion that cameras should be more smart.
429
So he had written a blog post of like, I want somebody.
430
I was like, oh, I'm just going to go pitch.
431
And look, I probably should have done like a big process in theory, but like I met Ilya, we had lunch.
432
I pitched him in the firm and I signed the term sheet.
433
And like every round has largely been like, look at this last round we just did.
434
I texted three people.
435
I texted David George.
436
I texted Neil and I texted the team at Sands and I said, look, guys, we're going to raise a round.
437
I'm looking for a fair price.
438
Like, don't try to squeeze me.
439
I don't need anything crazy.
440
I need probably $200, $300 million.
441
Who wants to send a term sheet?
442
And like, thankfully, they all said, like, we would love to participate.
443
That sounds like a great idea.
444
And so I don't know.
445
I think there's like a, it's similar to sales, I guess, which is like people can smell conviction and can smell confidence.
446
And if you just go in knowing exactly what you want, people are attracted to that.
447
Well, and it doesn't hurt.
448
You know, the numbers don't hurt, right, Garrett?
449
Maybe, but like, I don't know.
450
I mean, yeah, the business has always done pretty well, but we've had plenty of bad, like, there were moments in time where our gross margin was quite negative.
451
There's been moments in time where it's like, why are you all trying to pivot into law enforcement?
452
The neighborhood business is like ripping.
453
So there's always, just like every other company, like we have tons of warts and problems.
454
But like, we have, we've always had a plan, I guess.
455
Well, I just think the message there for founders and investors, frankly, is like, this is a relationship game and this is a marriage.
456
And you should be highly selective in who you get married to.
457
And that water meets its own level.
458
We talk about this a lot.
459
And you should be able to find the investor that you want to get married to.
460
I actually had one point because I was talking to an earlier entrepreneur, like earlier in the company.
461
They're about to go out there raise their seed, and he was like, Hey, here are the 40 investors I plan to pitch.
462
And I was like, Cool, cool, cool.
463
How many of them have you met before?
464
He was like, Zero.
465
I was like, Dude, you're like, you're, you're, this is not the right approach.
466
Like, these people are, you're going to be stuck with people forever.
467
And so, at least for me, like, early on, one day a quarter, I committed to like IR, you know, like spending time with investors.
468
And I never shared numbers because as soon as you share numbers, you're fundraising.
469
And I always just gave anecdotal updates, trying to show data points, trying to better understand what, do they actually ask me questions that I feel smarter leaving the meeting?
470
Like, do I feel like I'm pushing the business forward?
471
And so, I guess in theory, like, I guess the benefit of being able to run a tight process was also because I did spend time over the course of a year, you know, meeting people, tightening that list saying, Hey, I'm going to go meet with 30 investors in one day or 10 investors in one day.
472
That might be as one that I'm going to keep for the next conversation.
473
I think, I think entrepreneurs have this bad mindset that, like, it is your job as a CEO to fundraise.
474
So, like, just treat it like a job.
475
And, like, one day a quarter is not a lot of time, I think.
476
So, question for you: practically speaking, you're spending this time, you're, you know, you have these days once a quarter.
477
How did you actually not talk about numbers?
478
Because everyone, you know, when you're, when you're doing the, they're going to like try and get some sense.
479
You're going to say, well, you know, share what you're comfortable with, but like, how big are you?
480
You know, like, how did you actually not share numbers?
481
I think you have to change the framing of the meeting.
482
Because if I go, let's say, like, I was raised, let's say I started a new company today and I emailed you guys and says, hey, I'd love to meet.
483
You're going to assume that I'm pitching because that's what you do.
484
So, I always framed the meetings as like, hey, you know, maybe we've never met.
485
I say, hey, I've got a company called Flock.
486
I've got a couple questions around go-to-market, product development.
487
I'd love to talk to you about how your portfolio companies have solved that if you've got 30 minutes.
488
And so, naturally, they're going to ask the questions.
489
You got to be willing to share a little bit, right?
490
Like, it's a dating game.
491
Like, you got to show a little bit.
492
But, like, there's a very different framing of the meeting where it's like, hey, I want your advice.
493
I want you to see the questions that I'm thinking about.
494
I want you to show me, can you actually help me build this business?
495
And I think the smart investors know like there's intentionality around this structure of a meeting versus like, I'm going to come and just pitch and like give you a business update.
496
All right, we're coming up on time.
497
We try and keep these a little shorter than other podcasts.
498
But, Garrett, I want to talk or end with like a little bit about the future and how you're thinking about things.
499
So, maybe the last couple questions.
500
One is, what does Flock look like in 10 years?
501
And then I'll move to a candidate question and one final one.
502
So, if we're successful, which knock on wood, we'll keep up that path in 10 years from now.
503
America as a country is a dramatically different place.
504
It is a place where crime doesn't exist, where people are starting businesses and they're building families.
505
And they will largely look back and they'll be, you know, my kids will be in high school.
506
And in the U.S.
507
history book, they'll be a part about Flock and how, because of Flock, we are a safer, happier, healthier company or country.
508
And like, that might sound crazy, but like, that I believe, that is, I believe, is our life's mission at Flock is to achieve that.
509
And we always say, like, it's not just the technology.
510
We have very strong opinions on the policies and the types of people that we think we need in elected roles to help achieve that mission.
511
And so that would be the big picture for me in the next 10 years.
512
Who are these types of people?
513
You could kind of let me into it.
514
Who is a good fit for Flock?
515
Obviously, they got to believe in that vision.
516
Who else are you looking for?
517
Yeah, I mean, the number one thing is this unique combination of optimism and intensity.
518
I remember we have a new CFO, and we were wrapping up this first 90 days.
519
He's like, man, that was a crazy 90 days.
520
We bought a company.
521
We raised money.
522
You know, we went to proceed pre-world war with our biggest competitor.
523
Man, I'm sure it's going to be a pretty chill Q2.
524
And I was like, dude, this has been the last seven years of my life.
525
This is a normal quarter for me.
526
And the whole exec team was laughing.
527
So I think for people that have that level of optimism, that they believe that the world can be a better place and they want to help create it, that's number one.
528
And number two is like, do you have the urgency and intensity required to actually change the world?
529
And that's hard.
530
That's hard to find.
531
People say they want it until they get thrown into the ring.
532
You've talked about what's driving you.
533
You've talked about Flock's mission.
534
But what makes Garrett, like, what makes you tick?
535
Like, what makes you the way that you are?
536
Man, that's a heavy question to end on.
537
You know, the honest answer, I think I was born this way.
538
Like, I wake up really early in the morning and my team's like very used to that.
539
Like, I'll send them emails at 3 a.m., 4 a.m., you know, whatever.
540
And someone was like, oh, when did you start doing that?
541
And I was like, oh, no, even in high school, junior high, I was like up early.
542
Just like, I wanted to be the first one awake.
543
Like, I wanted to be the first one that starts their day.
544
So I guess I've just like always had this very competitive bent towards like, I wanted to be the best.
545
And I also think like I look back on my parents and like how they raised me and a bit of a mindset of like, you're either the best at doing something and therefore is worth doing, or like perhaps you should not.
546
And like, if, if, if anything, I think the outside of like raising the family, which is like, it's very hard.
547
And if you have kids, it's like very hard to, I wish I was a better dad.
548
I wish I'd better, like, there's no, there's no playbook on how to be an incredible parent.
549
I wish there was.
550
Someone should like really figure that out.
551
But outside of raising kids, I think the second like most interesting thing in life is like building incredible companies.
552
And so like, I guess for me, I just born with this.
553
Like, if I'm going to go do it, and that's what I've chosen to do with my life, God, I better be the best.
554
At least the best person I can be.
555
Very, very cool.
556
This is amazing, Garrett.
557
Thanks for spending a half hour with us, man.
558
This is a lot of fun.
559
Likewise.
560
Thanks, guys.
