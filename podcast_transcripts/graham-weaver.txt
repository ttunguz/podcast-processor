1
Something I speak about frequently on Invest Like the Best is the idea of life's work.
2
A more fun way to think about it is that I'm looking for maniacs on a mission.
3
This is the basis for our investment firm Positive Sum, and it's the reason why I'm so enthusiastic about our presenting sponsor, RAMP.
4
Not only are the founders, Kareem and Eric, life's work-level founders, certainly maniacs on a mission, they have created a product that is effectively an unlock for founders and finance team to do more of their life's work by streamlining financial operations, saving everyone their most precious resource, time.
5
RAMP has built a command and control system for corporate cards and expense management.
6
You can issue cards, manage approvals, make vendor payments of all kinds, and even automate closing your books all in one place.
7
Speaking from my own experience using RAMP for my business, the product is wildly intuitive, simplistic, and makes life so much easier that you'll feel bad for any company who hasn't yet made the switch.
8
The RAMP team is relentless, and the product continues to evolve to save you time that you would never have dreamed of getting back.
9
To me, there is nothing more interesting than technologies that reduce friction for other entrepreneurs to be able to build the thing that they want to.
10
So much attention has gone to cloud computing, APIs, and other ways of making life easy for founders.
11
What RAMP has done and is doing is build yet another set of tools in this category.

Hey everyone, Patrick O'Shaughnessy here.
16
If you've been thinking about the infrastructure behind AI, what's powering it, where capital is flowing, and how to stay ahead of the curve, you'll want to join me for a live webcast I'm hosting with AlphaSense.
17
It's called What's Next for AI and Data Centers, and we're diving into the future of cloud compute, data center investment, and the cybersecurity landscape that's forming around it.
18
I'll be joined by Michelle Brophy from AlphaSense and Gary Michel, formerly of AWS, to break down the most important forces shaping this space.
19
We'll also get into topics like the investment impact of Google's acquisition of Wiz and how tools like DeepSeek are influencing spend.com slash invest to register.
20
Again, that's alpha-sense.com slash invest.
21
Hope to see you there.
22
Ridgeline gets me so excited because every investment professional knows the core challenge that they solve.

My guest today is Graham Weaver.
44
Graham is the founder of Alpine Investors, a large private equity firm targeting an interesting market inefficiency.
45
Alpine focuses on the thousands of $20 million or so revenue businesses whose baby boomer owners want to retire but lack succession plans.
46
Alpine buys companies and installs 28-year-old military veterans and top MBA graduates as CEOs, leveraging 25 years of intellectual property on how young executives can successfully run established businesses.
47
Alpine's CEO and Training Program is now the most applied-to-job at Harvard, Stanford, and Kellogg business schools.
48
In this conversation, we discuss the past, present, and future of their unique approach.
49
Please enjoy my conversation with Graham Weaver.
50
I think the place to begin would be to just understand what you are trying to build and why.
51
Great question.
52
We have three North Stars at Alpine.
53
One is to be the number one performing private equity fund in the world as measured by MOIC.
54
Our specific goal is 5X on every fund.
55
Number two is we want to be the best place to work for the top talent.
56
So we want it to be a place where the very best people can come.
57
And really everything that we do fits under one of those three and usually all three.
58
When you think about 5X, MOIC, why do you care about that?
59
Why that number?
60
Where did that come from?
61
We went through a really tough period in the recession.
62
We didn't have a fund for a number of years.
63
So we had three years to kind of work on our business and really do some deep thinking.
64
I hired some executive coaches.
65
We can talk more about that.
66
But part of that was kind of the questions you're asking, why are you doing this?
67
What's your goal?
68
What are you waking up every day to do?
69
And I think we wanted to create something that was going to get us just jumping out of bed in the morning.
70
And so we said, hey, we want to be the number one performing fund of all time.
71
So we looked at all the data that was public on some of the pension funds' websites and information.
72
And we said, hey, if we could deliver 3X net consistently on every fund, that would put us in the conversation.
73
We've been outperforming that.
74
So we increased our goal a little bit.
75
What's underneath it?
76
You're probably a person that could build a whole variety of different kinds of businesses.
77
Why is high-performing private equity one that's interesting to you?
78
I never knew what private equity was until I graduated from college.
79
So I didn't have this background.
80
This was never a goal of mine when I started.
81
But when I got recruited out of college to go into private equity, I just thought it was, I had a real burning interest in business.
82
And I thought once I learned what private equity was, I was thinking, wow, this is the best expression of building businesses.
83
We get to do it over and over and over across a bunch of businesses.
84
In terms of why I try to be the best, I guess ever since I was pretty young, I just never thought about doing anything other than trying to be the best in the world at it.
85
It's like, there's a great quote by Daniel Burnham who says, make no little plans for they have no power to stir one's blood.
86
What's the earliest that you can remember?
87
So I was 12 years old.
88
My parents went through a really bitter, ugly divorce.
89
We changed schools to a new school.
90
So I didn't really have friends.
91
So the ground beneath me was pretty unsettled.
92
Grew up in a small town in Ohio, like in the Rust Belt outside of Toledo.
93
And I mowed lawns.
94
I mowed lawns about six hours a weekend to make money.
95
That was the best paying job.
96
I had a Sony Walkman, and I started to listen to books on tape.
97
For whatever reason, our library had this self-help section.
98
So I had these books like Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill and Lead the Field by Earl Nightingale, Universal Laws of Success and Achievement by Brian Tracy.
99
So there were only like three of them, three or four.
100
So for the next X years, I just would six hours a weekend walk back and forth.
101
Brainwash yourself.
102
Literally brainwash myself walking back and forth in the hot Ohio sun.
103
And these authors, thank God, just had incredible content that I really needed at that.
104
I was this young, impressionable kid that was having a lot of trouble in my life.
105
And I had these frameworks to just hang my life on, for lack of a better word.
106
And there were really kind of three big ones that came from that.
107
One was, hey, you don't get to be a victim.
108
Yes, you have things that have happened to you, and they're not necessarily your fault, but you walking around blaming people and thinking, woe is me.
109
That's not going to serve anyone.
110
You got to take control of your life.
111
Now, that sounds probably really obvious to you and me right now, but back then, like, that was a new concept for me, grabbing control of your life.
112
And then they were huge about deciding what you want and writing down your goals.
113
And I got really into that.
114
I would write my goals down three or four times a day, literally all through high school.
115
And then the third one was, you got to make some choices.
116
So you could have kind of any.
117
And then you have to kind of draw a bright line and give yourself permission to not do goals three through 30.
118
Those are really the three concepts.
119
I'm summarizing thousands of hours of lawnmowing.
120
So then what happened, to answer your question, why I felt the first time I started feeling like this, I started applying this to really small things like getting an A on a test or running a faster mile or something like this.
121
And it just worked exactly like all the authors said.
122
I just kept pushing the boundaries of what I thought I could do.
123
And I never really ran into, and I still probably have yet to run into boundaries that you couldn't blow through.
124
So you said it worked?
125
Like what specifically worked?
126
Just writing it down and working hard or something more practical?
127
The very, very first major thing that I ever tried to do was right after the summer when I started listening to these tapes.
128
And it was to this day the hardest thing I ever did.
129
So I wrestled.
130
I was on the varsity team my sophomore year and I wrestled at 155.
131
I had a starting position.
132
The captain dropped down to my weight class.
133
I looked up and down the lineup and the only guy I could beat was at 125.
134
So I'm six feet tall and I dropped 30 pounds and I wrestled 125.
135
I was eating 900 calories a day.
136
I was going on runs in the morning.
137
It's like nine degrees outside.
138
And I just powered through that.
139
And all of a sudden, I was like, wow, if I could do that, at least the other goals I said, I was able to eat.
140
And so I just got to feel this incredible power of being able to really change the trajectory of your life by just deciding you wanted to.
141
It was really cool.
142
I just got done reading the stories of Dan Gable.
143
Is that the guy's name?
144
Yeah.
145
He's incredible.
146
What is it about wrestling?
147
Like it seems, we'll talk about rowing too, which I know you did a lot of as well.
148
What is it about, maybe those two are similar, the extreme nature?
149
It seems like it has a lot to teach, maybe even more so than other sports.
150
Dan Gable is one of my favorites.
151
He has a great quote.
152
He says, once you've wrestled, everything in life is easy.
153
I think that's dead on.
154
It's dead on.
155
That's it.
156
So I think that wrestling is just the most primal sport.
157
In our high school, wrestling was a big sport in the Midwest, in Ohio.
158
They would turn a mat light on.
159
The gym would be packed.
160
People are yelling and screaming.
161
There's a mat light on.
162
The lights are off in the whole arena.
163
And it's just you and one other person.
164
And you're trying to defeat the other person.
165
I mean, it's crazy.
166
It's a pretty intense sport.
167
And then the weight loss and the training and everything, the hardest thing I ever did.
168
I think it's something about just the primal nature of that.
169
Can you say maybe one degree more about this idea that you can just choose?
170
It sounds so simple, but I've experienced that same thing.
171
And every time I do it, I'm amazed how powerful it can be.
172
But I want to understand the contours of it from your perspective.
173
What does that mean?
174
What does it feel like to choose?
175
What did you choose?
176
What was the process?
177
Whatever else you can say about this.
178
The first thing I'd say is that if you watch most people, they're kind of asleep or unconscious.
179
I am too sometimes.
180
Imagine you get up, whatever your routine is, you brush your teeth, you get ready for work, you commute to work, you have a tough commute, you get to work, you have a couple meetings, some Zoom calls, then you eat, then you return some emails, you have a few more meetings, you get home, return some emails, watch some Netflix, go to bed.
181
There's all this busyness.
182
You're just kind of doing today what you did yesterday.
183
You're doing tomorrow what you did today.
184
And you're stringing together that and calling it the life.
185
So there's this real level of unconsciousness about it.
186
So the first part is step back and just make space.
187
And I do this with an executive coach.
188
You can do this with a journal.
189
You can do it with a friend.
190
My favorite question of all time is: what would you do if you knew you wouldn't fail?
191
I'll actually build it up a little bit better on one of the audio tapes I heard.
192
This guy said, Okay, imagine there's this genie that comes out of this magic lamp and he says to you, Hey, Patrick, I've only been in here like a thousand years, so I can't give you the traditional three wishes.
193
But what I can give you is that whatever you throw yourself into with your career, your life, vocation, like it's going to work out amazingly well.
194
And you'll have ups and downs.
195
It'll take a long time, but I'll be here to bless you with that.
196
What would you wish for?
197
And then the punchline is: go do that thing.
198
That's your life path.
199
That's what your soul really wants to do.
200
And that's what you would do if you get out of your head and get out of your fear of failure.
201
So that's one great question.
202
Another one would be like, if you didn't have to worry about the how.
203
So relax the how, you're going to do it.
204
The coaching quote is: the how is the killer of all great dreams.
205
Make space, ask these really provocative questions.
206
And it's not like you're going to answer them right away, but you might, two days later in the shower, you might answer that question and then you'll really know you're going to feel it when you really know it.
207
And then, and then it's really, really tough to go do it.
208
It takes a lot of courage and sometimes the path isn't clear.
209
But I think that's where the real fun of life is: is really trying to get in touch with what your answer is to some of those questions.
210
So maybe pick another thing in your high school or early years, something you wanted, and then the steps you want to each of these tapes.
211
Sure.
212
Yeah.
213
Just picture you walking around with this volume or like, well, I want to make sure that you're going to be able to do that.
214
So I go to college because I thankfully turned on to these tapes early.
215
I did really well in high school and I got to go to Princeton.
216
So I was, I think, the first kid in my school to ever even apply there, let alone go.
217
So I go to Princeton and all of a sudden, I literally felt like Forrest Gump in that scene where his brace.
218
I had like all this space.
219
And so I literally was like, oh, wow, now I can really let go with these goals.
220
I set three goals going to Princeton.
221
I was going to be the valedictorian.
222
I was going to be the number one rower in the United States, even though I've never rowed before.
223
I didn't even know that the boats went backwards.
224
And third, I was going to start a business to pay for school.
225
To get the end of the story, I didn't actually achieve any of those goals, but I came really close on all three.
226
And so rowing is probably the simplest one to explain.
227
So I show up.
228
I'm a novice.
229
I'm 130 pounds from the wrestling, you know.
230
And I got my ass kicked because there's kids who'd rowed for six years and they knew how it worked.
231
So I got cut my freshman year, but they didn't cut anyone.
232
Instead, they said, okay, if you don't make a boat, you're going to be a land warrior and you can use the rowing machines.
233
And I still remember when they posted the boats and my name wasn't on there.
234
I did the math and I said, okay, women's, heavyweight, light, I was a lightweight, lightweight.
235
And I did the math on how many people got cut and how many rowing machines there were.
236
And so I was like, okay, I got to get here really early because all these people are going to be using rowing machines.
237
I show up the next morning.
238
I worked all the way back.
239
I talked myself into getting there at like 5:30 in the morning.
240
You know, the punchline.
241
I get there.
242
There's nobody there.
243
There was no one there at 5.36, 7.
244
No one ever showed up because Land Warrior was a euphemism for you just got cut.
245
You got cut.
246
I stayed in Rode and I met this guy who was training for the national team, Mike Taty.
247
And he and I were the only two guys in the morning at the Princeton boathouse.
248
And he ignored me.
249
He's a legend.
250
He coached the U.S.
251
Olympic team.
252
He went on to coach the U.S.
253
Olympic team to a gold.
254
And I didn't know any of this at the time.
255
I just saw this tall, skinny guy just hammering this erg.
256
And eventually he kind of took me under the wing a little bit.
257
After I showed up at 5:30 in the morning for like three weeks.
258
I get better, a little bit better my freshman year, better my sophomore year.
259
By my junior year, I had one of the top times, maybe the top time on the 2K rowing machine on the team.
260
And then by senior year, I was captain.
261
We won nationals.
262
And so it was just everything came together.
263
But it was just a really linear expression of if I put in a certain number of hours.
264
This is what Mike Tatty said: He said, Here's the formula.
265
It's really simple: sit on this machine and row as long as you can, slightly below your aerobic threshold.
266
Basically, you'll hit your goals.
267
And I was like, That's it?
268
He's like, Yeah, that's it.
269
He was very simple.
270
And I just did that and it worked.
271
It just required a lot of hours.
272
Is there anything else between ages 12 and 22 that without which you would be a wildly different person?
273
I'll just say a couple things about my dad real quick.
274
So, my dad started a veterinary practice about the time I was born.
275
He and his father went in.
276
My grandfather's a veterinarian too.
277
They started this practice called Weaver Animal Hospital in our hometown.
278
And they had a falling out of some kind.
279
I don't know what happened.
280
I never heard the whole story, but my dad like stormed out.
281
Well, he has a mortgage and three kids, and we have no money.
282
The only money we had coming in was he would take emergency calls at like two in the morning.
283
So his little beeper would go off, and he would get up, drive to the office, fix a dog's leg, and go back.
284
And he did that for 25 years.
285
And I think the bad news was he was really never around.
286
We didn't have a great close relationship when I was growing up.
287
But I think that ended up having a big impression on me because if you were to ask him about his practice, he ended up building this really, really successful veterinary practice, but he just did it one emergency call at a time over a long period of time.
288
And I think.
289
He would say it took way longer than he thought, and he built something much bigger than he thought.
290
And I would say almost the exact same thing about my business.
291
I never really put that together until many, many years later that I was watching that as a kid.
292
What was the story for between graduation and starting to tell the story that leads to Alpine?
293
Why did you get interested in this field?
294
What was it about investing or business that called you?
295
Graduate from college.
296
I never once thought about my job.
297
I never had an internship because I was always rowing during the summers.
298
I got recruited from Morgan Stanley, which had an in-house investment bank.
299
And to my knowledge, they were the only ones that recruited in 1994 directly into private equity.
300
The guy who recruited me was this guy, David Ramsey, and he kind of explained to me what private equity was.
301
And the way he described it, he couldn't see any reason to do anything else ever.
302
You know, he thought it was the greatest business.
303
And he had a pretty compelling case.
304
So I was really just fascinated by how you could buy these companies and build them and be a part of so many businesses.
305
I just thought it was the coolest job I'd ever heard.
306
I couldn't believe that you got a blank piece of paper from investors to go buy things.
307
So I was fascinated.
308
However, I come out of college and I'm just ready to run through walls.
309
Patrick just had this incredible experience in college.
310
And I show up, I get this job on Wall Street.
311
You know, I've seen the movies and everything.
312
And I think it's going to be this incredible experience.
313
I learned how to build a financial model in the first three weeks.
314
And then I do that for two years.
315
That was all I did.
316
That's all that anyone at undergrad ever did.
317
And then we did it, by the way, 80 to 100 hours a week.
318
The culture wasn't great.
319
And I just remember thinking, is this what work is like?
320
Is this what you do when you graduate?
321
I've been in school 16 years and this is my biggest.
322
And that would end up being a really, really foundational part of Alpheim: just that kind of feeling of, wow, I have so much more to give to this place.
323
Why am I only using like 3% of my capacity?
324
My friend Jeremy Giffon has this really funny idea for two models of success that he dubs the Peter Thiel model and the Arnold Schwarzenegger model.
325
The Peter Thiel model being like a lot of maybe public and market investors that I know who kind of sit around and think and then make infrequent decisions on the back of like a special insight that leads to great returns.
326
And then the Schwarzenegger model is just brute force, like more reps, more push.
327
I have an early guess as to which camp you might fall into.
328
But maybe react to that.
329
Do you think of private equity as the ultimate open tapestry for performance, almost for its own sake?
330
Like the ability to push and drive outcomes versus have insights that lead to good returns, which might be the other paradigm.
331
I mean, I think you can have investors in private equity that have the Peter Thiel model.
332
They make few large investments and they sit around and think and it looks like that.
333
That's not really us.
334
That's not how we're wired.
335
The way I like to think about it is I like to think about the world in like endogenous, winnable games and then ones that might be a little more exogenous and/or unwinnable or hard to win.
336
And so I don't want to just go full-on brute force in a non-winnable game.
337
So for example, in private equity today, it wasn't like this in 1984, but today, if you have a big business, you're going to hire an investment bank, you get the game, you're going to show it to 55 private equity funds.
338
For me to just go brute force in that red.
339
For me to go brute force in that, I think, isn't a good exercise.
340
If I have 100 units of energy, I want to use 25 of those units to go try to find a winnable game to play.
341
And then the other 75 would be like the brute force endogenous path.
342
So, maybe using that, I like that framework.
343
If we think about today's private equity landscape, where there are many, many funds that command huge sums of assets, my understanding, it's not the style of investing I'm in, but my understanding is if there's a good high-quality asset, it's an auction process in many cases.
344
It's a bidding war, and there are lots of great, highly professional, super-talented investors and firms that can buy private business.
345
Maybe describe the state of the market and what the characteristics might be of like winnable games within that broader market.
346
I mean, I think there's 5,500 private equity funds at any given great high-quality business like you're describing, particularly like take just extreme high-quality business, ERP subscription software business.
347
I mean, it doesn't get any higher quality than that.
348
There's a lot of people that can buy that.
349
There's a lot of people that can see what that's worth and do some calculation and come up with a value for that.
350
And by the way, it doesn't necessarily go to the smartest person, it goes to the highest bidder.
351
So, it's a little bit different where that doesn't mean that they were the smartest person necessarily.
352
It's just a really, really tough game.
353
And conversely, the winnable game that we're engaged in, and we learned this over the first 10 years of Alpine when we were really hands-on with these businesses, is we're going and finding a $20 million revenue plumbing company in Ball, Louisiana, where the owner's retiring and they need a new CEO in a small company.
354
We're putting in new IT systems.
355
We have a whole new playbook we're putting in.
356
Godspeed if you want to play that game, particularly at scale.
357
That's an endogenous, winnable game where it's just a ton of work.
358
But then the investment decision ends up being pretty easy.
359
When someone brings a deal to you and they say, okay, here's a business you're paying eight times EBITDA.
360
With the playbook that you have, you can blend that down to five times EBITDA.
361
You can borrow it at five and a half, and your platform is going to trade at 18.
362
The investment committee decision there is not the hard part.
363
The hard part is getting the CEO in place and the IT systems and all that.
364
So maybe walk us through the earliest days, right before and right after the start of Alpine.
365
What was going on?
366
What was your goal in your journal?
367
Give us this window into that period of time.
368
I was at Wall Street and then I got into Stanford Business School.
369
I deferred for a year.
370
I eventually went.
371
I show up.
372
And once again, I had that feeling of being unshackled again, where someone wasn't telling me where to be when when I was at business school.
373
So I decided I was going to start buying companies out of my dorm room.
374
That was really the beginning.
375
And my dad, he always wanted to name his company something to start with an A because of the yellow pages and start with an A and come up for the word American.
376
And so Alpine was a great, I thought, a great name.
377
And I lived on Alpine Road.
378
Funny story about that.
379
One time I sent a letter to a banker and it had my address.
380
And he said, oh, wow, they named the street after you.
381
Meanwhile, it's like one guy, you know, with no money.
382
Anyway, so we didn't have class on Wednesdays at Stanford.
383
So I would take a red-eye flight Tuesday night and then go visit these little manufacturing businesses in the Midwest.
384
So that was kind of how I spent the two years at Stanford.
385
Keep the story going.
386
So you come out of that.
387
Did you buy anyone?
388
Yeah, I bought a total of three companies.
389
I was 25, so I had no idea what I was doing.
390
And that's not false emails.
391
Where did you get the money to buy them?
392
So these were like half a million of EBITDA businesses that I bought for $2 million.
393
The seller would finance $1 million.
394
They had some equipment.
395
So I'd get the equity, literally get the equity down to like $100,000, which I also didn't have.
396
So part of it was I had some people on Wall Street who put in $10,000 here, $5,000 there.
397
And then at this time, Capital One was just starting.
398
Get an envelope in your mailbox and say, write yourself a check for $25,000 and pay no interest for two years.
399
And I did that.
400
I was like, okay, great.
401
That was where I contributed my equity to those deals.
402
And then later on, thank God, you get another one that said, roll your balance and pay no interest for another 12 months.
403
So that was playing a very high wire act, which I do not recommend.
404
Did those three businesses work?
405
No, they didn't.
406
Those three collectively ended up at a 1x.
407
I had one deal I did right after business school in the same industry that worked out really well and thankfully helped fund a bunch of the early part of Alpine.
408
But the first three were, I did literally everything wrong.
409
So what did you most learn from those three and then the one that worked right after?
410
They were in the label printing business, which was a good business because label might cost a penny on a $5 bottle of shampoo, but it contains all the product information.
411
So no one's going to wake, no purchasing manager is going to be a hero by saving a fraction of a penny on the label.
412
Had very good predictable revenue.
413
I missed two things.
414
One is you were really underwriting the underlying customers.
415
You had to go a level deeper and look.
416
That was the first thing I missed.
417
The second thing was I didn't understand how important management was.
418
And this would become a huge part of our philosophy later on.
419
The founder would retire, and then the number two person was there.
420
I just backed them.
421
And they were absolutely not backable.
422
I wildly underappreciated how much the management team mattered.
423
And I made that mistake three times before realizing I had made it.
424
So in the next one, next legal business, the underlying customer, the biggest customer we had was Trader Joe's, which was just like the best customer ever in the early 2000s.
425
They just grew 15%.
426
Yeah, 15% a year every year.
427
They paid in five days.
428
They allowed their vendors to have great margins.
429
So it was just, it was a home-run deal.
430
I owned it for 22 years and it paid.
431
Wow.
432
Yeah.
433
I just sold it a couple of years ago, actually.
434
It paid dividends along the way.
435
Thank God.
436
So now you've got a successful deal under your belt coming out of business school.
437
Sounds like obviously at this point, you would have said, this is the thing I want to do.
438
Is that right?
439
Or was there still searching to be done?
440
Oh, gosh.
441
It was 100% what I wanted to do, and I still chickened out.
442
So if you'd asked me any time in the two years, I was like, I know exactly what I want to do with my life.
443
As graduation starts approaching, all my classmates are getting jobs in private equity.
444
I'm getting a little FOMO and I'm also scared.
445
I take an interview, which turns into a job at an institutional private equity fund.
446
And I knew in my soul, it was not what I wanted to do.
447
And I showed up and a little bit of me died the day I started.
448
And I did that for a little bit of time.
449
And then I actually had a close friend of mine around that time, around my age, had passed away.
450
I just took a little time off and I just realized, hey, when am I going to do that?
451
And so I walked in a couple days later and quit.
452
And I didn't have anything to land on.
453
I didn't have a fund.
454
I didn't have investors.
455
I didn't have anything.
456
But I was like, I got to give this a shot.
457
It seems like so many of these stories, when they go this way, they start small and modest, SPVs or single deals or whatever.
458
So is that how yours was changing together before Alpine?
459
A bunch of single SPVs to buy one company.
460
Exactly.
461
What advice would you give people that hear that and they're like, yep, that's what I want to do.
462
I want to find a company, put together money, make it happen, start to build a track record.
463
I'd say a few things.
464
First is, I'd say pick one industry.
465
Don't go do three deals in three different industries because you're not really going to know that much.
466
In my case, I had that fourth deal was successful because I had done three and learned what really mattered.
467
What really mattered.
468
So I'd say try to stay in the same industry if you can.
469
Pick a good industry.
470
Secondly, I'd say pay yourself.
471
Sounds really obvious, but I didn't do that.
472
So when I, that was part of the pressure that I had about why I didn't go do that full time.
473
So carve out enough that you can live reasonably comfortably, even if that cuts into your total upside or something.
474
Duration is more important over the long period of time.
475
I made so many mistakes, Patrick, everything you could imagine.
476
But I also got in the game when I was 25.
477
So I just sit around thinking about it, overthinking it.
478
I got to get in the arena.
479
That would be my third piece of advice: go get in the arena.
480
What did you learn about raising money for deals when you really didn't have a track record and you were 25?
481
Okay, I started off trying to sell my track record, which was a catastrophe because what I didn't realize is these people are seeing phenomenal track records and then they're comparing me to that.
482
And I read this little book, and I don't remember anything else this book said.
483
It was a little book of selling.
484
It was called, but they had this line that said, people buy the salesperson, not the product.
485
And on the plane ride from Denver to San Francisco, I completely changed my presentation and was like, okay, I'm going to sell myself as someone that will figure this out and is going to be trustworthy, reliable, kill myself to make this work.
486
And that pitch landed a lot better than, hey, here's my three label deals.
487
Yeah, yeah.
488
They just read that book at the right time.
489
So then we fast forward to the chapter where now you have Alpine.
490
You have a private equity firm.
491
You're starting to raise bigger and bigger funds.
492
What are like the foundational core beliefs of the business, how it runs that are most distinctive from other firms of its type, would you say?
493
There's a number of them.
494
The first one I would say is, what's your objective function?
495
Our objective function is MOIC.
496
We have a specific number we put on that.
497
We're trying to do 5X on a fund.
498
Have you done that historically?
499
We've done 5X in our last four funds.
500
We have it marked at 5X in our last three, and the fourth one is well on its way.
501
Yeah.
502
And so we have an objective function that is specifically net MOIC.
503
And I think cascading from that is how long you want to hold businesses, how you're going to invest in them, how you're going to build them, what's your objective function, I think, matters a lot.
504
What's your goalpost?
505
And I think a lot of people use IRR maybe, or they're trying to raise their next fund or something like that.
506
And I think it can muddy up, you know, you're selling your best companies quickly so you can raise the next fund and have higher R's or what are you doing?
507
And I think the objective function matters.
508
Another belief that we have is the way that we're really going to create alpha is through talent.
509
That's probably the foundation of Alpine is just, we think that incredible leaders.
510
We'll look at B-plus industries that other people really don't look at as much, but we've paired that with an A-plus team.
511
We found that to be just a great combination.
512
We won't overpay for the A-plus industry.
513
We'll go down a little bit, and I could talk more about that.
514
That's number two.
515
And then, number three would be: I'm a huge fan in thinking/slash using your imagination.
516
We schedule time outside of the office.
517
In the Great Recession, we were spending a full day outside the office just really thinking, mapping out what do we want to build, what are the capabilities we want to have, using time to work on the business.
518
The expression I use is: we're planting seeds of oak trees that will yield us shade five years from now.
519
And if you can do that consistently, you can always create moats effectively.
520
But it takes a lot of discipline in the middle of all the crazy stuff you're working on to actually take time out to work on something that's important but not urgent, and that's the imagination and innovation.
521
When I do my like asking around, I'm always curious if you condense everything down to asking someone what is Alpine known for?
522
Like, what is the thing?
523
You only get one thing.
524
What you hear a lot is young talent development and relying on 20-something CEOs to run sometimes very large companies and the search and development process of that young talent, those young CEOs.
525
So, maybe you can like explain: when did you plant that acorn seed?
526
Why, how is it grown?
527
We can spend as much time as we want on this thing because it does seem to be like a fundamental part of the software.
528
Yeah, that's right, Patrick.
529
That is core.
530
So, the way it came about was in the early days, we were doing all kinds of things.
531
So, Dan Santer, one of my partners today, moved to Detroit for like a year.
532
Will Adams moved to Maine for two years to run this horrible business?
533
And a guy named Mike Duran was in Chicago.
534
I ran one of our companies, a slot machine business, for a while.
535
We got in when we were in the recession and we had all this time to kind of look back at our track record.
536
The best deals that we did were always ones where we put in either us or someone just like us to go run this business who knew nothing about the industry, but had these raw talent and also coachability to like say, Hey, I don't know everything.
537
So, who do I learn from?
538
Not this grizzled veteran that's already knows everything about the industry, but I'm going to look at things differently and fresh.
539
And by the way, I'm going to just run through walls.
540
Those were our very, very best deals.
541
Mike Duran ran one, a guy named Josh Greenberg ran one, and then Mark Stroud ran one.
542
At one point, I can still remember where I was when we had this conversation.
543
Those were also, by the way, the most fun, most fun board meetings.
544
So, you're sitting literally with your friend talking about how you're just going to just crush this crank.
545
And you know, when you walk out of that meeting, they're going to do it.
546
Yeah, it's not like the founder who says, Oh, yeah, oh, well, great idea, Patrick.
547
And they're writing it down.
548
You just know it's never going to happen.
549
It's the opposite of that.
550
And it was so much fun.
551
And so, at one point, we just said, Let's just do that every time from this point forward.
552
Let's just put our own team in 100% of the time.
553
And we burn the boats.
554
Brutal to burn those boats because bankers don't sell companies that don't have management teams.
555
So, we had to rebuild an entire sourcing engine to do that.
556
We had to change our brand in the market.
557
We're the brand now, if you don't want to continue, you call Alpine as opposed to the other private equity firms that will back the founder.
558
So, it was really, really brutal to make that change.
559
So is it true now today that you will not do a deal where you're not installing your own team?
560
In a platform company, we install our own team pretty much 100% of the time.
561
Every rule can have an exception.
562
So someone could be amazing.
563
Yeah, exactly.
564
So if they're coachable and they want to run through walls and meet our criteria that we would have otherwise, we're certain that that would even be easier.
565
But historically, we've last, I don't know, four funds, we've replaced the management 100%.
566
And we're super upfront going in.
567
We're saying, hey, you want to cash out and go hang out on your boat and whatever?
568
Great.
569
And then probably 80% of the time in the add-on investments, we're changing management.
570
Can you give us like a platform architecture or a platform building class, like 101 or 201?
571
Does platform mean roll up?
572
That's the word you hear a lot in private equity.
573
Like what is a platform?
574
How do you build one?
575
What are the steps?
576
So for us, it means roll-up.
577
And I'll use our best example.
578
So we started off plumbing in HVAC.
579
And we had this guy named...
580
It's always HVAC.
581
Yeah, I know.
582
Exactly.
583
This guy, A.J.
584
Brown, was a CEO in training.
585
We put him in to be CFO of one of our companies.
586
He did great there.
587
We sold the business.
588
We repatriated him.
589
We said, okay, you're ready for prime time.
590
You're going to be the CEO of a platform.
591
And then we paired him with another CEO in training that was just coming in, this guy, Will Mattson.
592
So they become president and CEO or CEO and CFO initially.
593
We picked HVAC.
594
We had a little experience in that space.
595
They were excited about that space.
596
And then we started just going and visiting tons of companies.
597
And when you go visit 20 companies in the space, you learn more in one three-hour management visit than you do in three weeks in a conference room.
598
And then what you're picking up in those meetings is what does great look like?
599
And what's cool about it, each company probably does one thing great.
600
The company does recruiting great.
601
This company does purchasing, training.
602
But if you add that up across 20 companies and you grab every single piece of that playbook, you have the best playbook in the world.
603
So you're starting to architect what does that look like before you even have bought a company.
604
So we're hiring the CEO, getting the industry right.
605
We're getting the management, part of the management team right.
606
And then we're getting the playbook right before we've ever even written a check.
607
Then we start going and buying companies.
608
The first couple we try to buy pretty small.
609
I think our first deal here was $8 million of EBITDA, and we learned a ton, and we bought another one that was like two of EBITDA building along the way.
610
And then we're also building our holdco.
611
So we're building out the CEO, CFO, chief people officer.
612
That's the platform.
613
That's the platform.
614
Yeah, the holdco is the platform.
615
Our best companies, we've really overinvested early in those platforms.
616
It's really expensive to do that.
617
And we have platforms that are pretty young that have a $15 million holdco expense, but that's really your foundation going forward.
618
And where does that $15 million come from?
619
That comes from the fund?
620
Yeah, yeah.
621
We're capitalizing.
622
We're losing the money, capitalizing a new company.
623
That's the but it's not quite that bad because we're pretty quickly buying companies that have EBITDA that we're using to fund the businesses.
624
So they're cash flow positive pretty quickly.
625
So this particular deal, one of the early things we figured out is, you said there's a lot of HVAC companies, but we figured out that every competitor in HVAC was doing the same thing.
626
They were buying the $5 to $10 million EBITDA business that had a great management team.
627
They were all buying that same company.
628
It turns out 90% of the market is below that and management wants to leave and cash out.
629
And so we said, why don't we build a system to go buy that company?
630
And that included talent, was a huge lever.
631
So I give eight.
632
They built their own CEO and training program because they came through with the Alpines program and they said, this is amazing.
633
The company's called Apex.
634
They built their own Apex.
635
One of the early people they brought through was this guy named Brad Schwartz.
636
So his resume is West Point, Green Beret, Wharton Business School.
637
And he comes in to run this, I think, $8 million revenue business.
638
And fast forward, he's running a $500 million division today.
639
The business we initially bought was $40 million, I think, of revenue and eight of EBITDA.
640
This year it'll do $3 billion of revenue.
641
We haven't put any more equity in.
642
They've just been accumulating these small little businesses.
643
So the business has gone from, we put in 50 million of equity.
644
This year, it'll do 500 million of EBITDA, and we put in no additional equity.
645
And it's just been an exercise in just really having each business that we acquire putting in incredible talent.
646
We rip out their IT systems and we put in a financial package, an ERP system, a business intelligence system.
647
And then every single company we buy has to literally input every job they do exactly the same so we can compare all the data across all the companies.
648
And then we have a training school now for the military veterans.
649
I think that we have 80 military veterans as general managers of that company.
650
They've been phenomenal.
651
That's an example of starting literally with a blank piece of paper, which is how we do each thing.
652
We form a pod of people to go assess a bunch of different industries.
653
We design the playbook and then hopefully repatriate someone from our system into be the leadership team.
654
And we have a lot of the key decisions already made and evaluated.
655
We have plenty of time and patience before we ever have to wire money.
656
So if I think about it, if I step all the way back on like what service Alpine has and will render in the market, it's, I have this visualization of decades of small businesses being built by the baby boom and Gen X generations or whatever.
657
There's tons of them.
658
I don't know how many there are.
659
Probably a gazillion beach facts alone.
660
True for like every industry.
661
The problem is that there's nothing to do with them when those people want to retire.
662
And basically your solution is solve that with talent.
663
That was like the unique insight and thing that you've built up relative to other private equity firms or something.
664
Yeah.
665
And I would say at a headline, it's solve it with talent.
666
And underneath that is a whole bunch of intellectual property about how to make that person who goes into that company on day one be really successful.
667
Because if you just change management, it's really hard and it can go really badly.
668
We've learned that the hard way.
669
We have a lot of intellectual property on like what does that CEO actually do on day zero and the first 30 days and 60 days and 90 days.
670
We have intellectual property on the systems and how we're measuring it and literally how they're hiring.
671
It is what you said, Patrick, but then underneath that, there's a lot of intellectual property about how to actually do that.
672
Without giving away all the secrets to us, can you give us like a flavor of that IP and like some of the things that you've learned?
673
I'll give you a couple things.
674
So first is we have about 30 coaches in our ecosystem that are versed in this playbook.
675
And so they get paired up with this first-time CEO and they've been through it a lot of times and they're doing this specifically the Alpine playbook.
676
So they can't be able to do that.
677
They're 1099s, but they're probably spending partners.
678
Yeah, they're probably spending 70% of their time on Alpine.
679
So they have that intellectual property.
680
They're literally partnering with this first-time CEO and going through this first six months of.
681
People are upset because Joe's plumbing, Joe's retiring.
682
They've been working with Joe for 15 years.
683
Here's this 28-year-old that doesn't know the industry.
684
They're not thrilled on day zero, which is understandable.
685
The first move for the first 60 days is listen.
686
They sit down with the key employees and say, hey, tell me about your role.
687
What do you do here?
688
What's going well?
689
What else?
690
What else?
691
What else?
692
What's not going well?
693
What else?
694
What else?
695
Hey, if you were me, what would you be focused on?
696
What should the top priorities be?
697
What are we working on?
698
That's a waste of time.
699
What should I be worried about?
700
What are the biggest opportunities we have right now, biggest problems?
701
They're going and doing that.
702
And they're meeting with, depending on how big the business is, they might be meeting with 20, 30 people in the business.
703
Without a doubt, without fail, one of the first, the biggest things people say is, I've worked here for 15 years and no one's ever asked me my opinion before.
704
In a very short period of time, we're really.
705
Fucking Joe.
706
Yeah, exactly.
707
We're really engendering trust.
708
And then we're, you know, we're using that.
709
And we might say, hey, I heard that you're number one.
710
Hey, Patrick, I heard you're right.
711
Your favorite idea was that we're going to expand internationally.
712
We're not going to do that this quarter, but we did hear, you know, you, you don't have to do everything they say, but they have to feel heard.
713
So they do that with the employees.
714
They do that with the customers.
715
And then from that, they're kind of enrolling the top people and designing the plan.
716
Here's what we got to do.
717
Here's what the low-hanging fruit is.
718
And usually the fruit is so low and it's so obvious when you get through that.
719
I know because I did this.
720
I took over a business at one point.
721
And I remember thinking, how did they not do all this stuff?
722
They just talked to their own people.
723
One of my executive coaches had this great quote: the answer is always in the room.
724
You don't have to go hire McKinnon.
725
And then the customers will tell you about the product or the service or whatever.
726
Yeah, so I was going to say, like, one beneficiary, presumably, of this, is the end customer.
727
Absolutely.
728
You're not going from 50 to 500 of EBITDA if someone's not happy at the end.
729
Yeah, 100%.
730
Just work backwards.
731
I think the two biggest underappreciated leading indicators of success are the net promoter score of the customers and the net promoter score of the employees.
732
We go and we measure the net promoter score of employees right when we buy the business.
733
In other words, before we came in the business, how engaged and happy are our employees.
734
And then we measure every six months going forward.
735
And we publish that across all of Alpine.
736
And we hold CEOs accountable for two reasons.
737
One is I think it is probably one of, if not the most important leading indicator of success for the business.
738
And two, going back to being a force for good, it's probably the thing I'm the proudest of in terms of the impact that we have is 40,000 employees are having an experience that they enjoy coming to work more, significantly more after we buy the business.
739
And I just think about, okay, you're a single mom and you're working at a call center in one of our companies or something.
740
Before we come in, you know, maybe you're clocking in, you're clocking out.
741
You're not that excited.
742
You're spending half your waking hours doing this.
743
Maybe the people don't know your name or whatever.
744
And then how you show up in your community.
745
And 70% of people, and this is true across any industries in the U.S., you can replicate this study, but 70% of people dislike their job or they're disengaged from their job right now today.
746
And if we can flip that, you know, and have 70% of people feel really engaged, it's not just that it's good for business, but I think it makes a big difference.
747
And it's something that it's probably one of the things I'm the proudest of of all the things that we've done.
748
I want to come back and spend a lot of time on the searching, selection, training of this young, talented 27-year-old that takes one of these things over, like what that whole system looks like.
749
But before we do that, I just want to close the thinking on the financial outcome associated with this strategy of building one of these platforms.
750
So again, going all the way back to your 5X MOIC target objective function or whatever for the funds, what does that mean you need out of these platforms?
751
Where does the return come from?
752
Is it multiple expansion?
753
Is it fundamental growth?
754
Simply, those are the two simplest areas it can come from.
755
How do you think about like what you need to get for one of these things to be a success?
756
So the way we think about it is we're underwriting typically an individual deal to a, let's say, a 3X net outcome.
757
And that will typically not have multiple expansion.
758
It'll have, you're buying the business, you're leveraging it with whatever the debt multiple of the company is, and then you're growing it.
759
We should be able to get to kind of a 3x, 3.5 gross in five years.
760
So that's kind of our typical standard underwriting.
761
Where the 5X comes into play is you have these asymmetric outcomes where things go right, organic growth kicks in better than you thought, and you can hold the business longer than you thought.
762
You can kind of portfolio your manage your way to a 5X through a bunch of getting on base and then good things happening.
763
If we underwrote an individual deal to 5X, we would never close a deal.
764
So that's kind of how we think about it.
765
If you look back at the, now that you have all this data and all these funds, is it true in most of the funds that it's one platform or deal that dominates the returns?
766
Yeah, there's definitely an asymmetry for sure.
767
One of my favorite things, I remember I used to read every word that Buffett ever wrote in his annual reports.
768
And I'm going to get this a little bit wrong, but it'll be directionally correct.
769
I want to say in like 1988 or something, he'd made half of all of his money on two stocks, Geico and the Washington Post.
770
He had tons of businesses he bought and sold and everything, but 50% of it was.
771
Yeah, there's like asymmetry.
772
And yeah, we tend to have at least one real outlier deal per fund.
773
As we're learning, we're figuring out the ingredients of that outlier better and better and better so that we're hoping that each seed that we're planting at least has the potential to be that outlier.
774
We want every shot on gold to at least have that upside.
775
They won't all hit that, but we're getting better at identifying the ingredients of that outlier, which is, hey, build a real company, you know, build a real holdco with a phenomenal team in a large industry.
776
Really spend the time to get the playbook right and give yourself some breathing room.
777
And if we're doing that again and again and again, we're now starting to have a lot more consistent businesses that are these outliers.
778
In our more recent funds, it's not one company.
779
It's, in fact, in our most recent fund, I'm biased, but I think just about every company has that potential as of now to be a real outlier.
780
Let's go back to the talent.
781
It almost sounds like what you've built is like a captive search fund business.
782
Yeah, that's right.
783
No, that's a good analogy.
784
It's all the same.
785
That's a really good analogy.
786
Personal attributes, time of their life.
787
So one question I have is on incentives.
788
How do you incentivize, like in a search fund, it's really tight and clean.
789
Like you're buying a business.
790
If it does phenomenally well, you as the searcher CEO are going to do phenomenally well.
791
What have you learned about incentivizing the people that get installed to run these businesses?
792
You know, using your search fund analogy, let's say that you're the kind of person that wants the ball early.
793
That's the search fund person.
794
They want to be CEO early.
795
I love that.
796
I was 25, I wanted the ball.
797
I appreciate that characteristic.
798
So they want the ball early.
799
And if you think about what they want the ball to do, it's to go run a business.
800
That's what they want.
801
In the search fund world, they first have to go build a private equity firm to find and close.
802
And if you actually look at the data, I used to invest in search, I don't know, invested in 70 search funds or more.
803
They usually mess up that first part.
804
Investing is a pattern recognition business.
805
Bankers don't want to sell to them because they're only going to ever do one deal with that banker.
806
They have a clock ticking.
807
So there's a lot of stuff wrong with that first part.
808
And then the other thing that's kind of doesn't really work is they don't have really any support.
809
They're like, yeah, you get the ball, good news, but you don't know what to do with the ball.
810
And so we're trying to say, hey, we have, I think, one of the greatest sourcing engines in private equity.
811
We're going to find phenomenal businesses.
812
Plus, we're going to have a whole team that's going to help you evaluate the industry and make sure we're getting those right.
813
We want you to play a winnable game.
814
We want to give you a platform where you're going to win based on your talents and hiring and firing and all those things, not missing on the industry.
815
You're not going to figure that out when you're 28.
816
We're very good at that part of the business.
817
And then once they buy the business, we want to have, and we'll get into the training, we want to say, hey, look, we have 25 years of intellectual property of how to be a CEO, but not just how to be a CEO, how to be a 30-year-old CEO going into a really established business and getting that team on your team alongside you and going forward.
818
That's the specific intellectual property that we have.
819
And it's not super complicated, but we might as well start you off 25 years.
820
So, where do you find these people?
821
Where do they come from?
822
How did that start?
823
I'm sure it's much easier now.
824
You've got a reputation like this can be a go do this thing.
825
It was a very inauspicious start, Patrick.
826
At the time we started the CEO and training process, I was a guest lecturer at Stanford Business School, and I would meet with students for coffee and stuff.
827
And the class I was a lecturer for, it was an entrepreneurship class.
828
And so the students wanted to be a CEO.
829
And they'd say, hey, how do I go do this?
830
And SearchFund was an option.
831
And they didn't like some of the elements I mentioned earlier.
832
And so I didn't really have a good answer.
833
So finally, one student, I said, hey, why don't you join us?
834
We'll teach you how to be a CEO and we'll put you in one of our companies.
835
That sounded great.
836
So we hired this guy and we weren't going to put him in a CEO.
837
We're going to put him in like CFO or COO in one of our companies.
838
We couldn't get anyone to hire him in our portfolio because they said, okay, let me get this straight, Graham.
839
You've got someone who's got no experience, is a little bit entitled and super expensive.
840
Like, how about no?
841
So we couldn't get that first person place.
842
He left.
843
The next year, we had this woman, Laura Walsh, and same thing.
844
But although this time I said to this particular CEO, I said, listen, hire her.
845
And if she doesn't work out in a year, I'll reimburse you her salary from the management company.
846
So like a money-back guarantee.
847
And she knocked it out of the park.
848
And he's like, I want three more.
849
And then it kind of took off from there.
850
And when I say took off, then the next year we had two.
851
Yeah.
852
The next year we had three.
853
And it took a long time.
854
And it also took us a while to really figure out what kind of business they would be successful in and where their blind spots were and what they could do and not do.
855
We made every mistake you could make.
856
But thankfully, we made that on smaller classes of CEOs.
857
And now we have it a little bit more delta.
858
And we're still learning.
859
I mean, I'm not declaring victory at all.
860
What are some of the, especially?
861
I like the surprising one.
862
Obviously, hard work and smart.
863
Okay, so I'll say some, and then I'm not sure how many of these are surprising.
864
So the number one attribute is will to win.
865
I'm going to take this project or business or whatever, and I'm going to put it on my shoulders and run it through this burning building.
866
And you just see that show up in their life historically.
867
They've done that.
868
There's this ownership and drive.
869
And that's number one.
870
Number two, which is probably 1A, is grit.
871
So they've been knocked down, they got up.
872
They've been knocked down, they got up, because that's going to happen as a CEO.
873
And I think the great thing about getting knocked down and getting up is at some point, you just have the belief that you're going to get up and you have the expectation you're going to get knocked down every now and then.
874
And that one is actually more rare than you would think.
875
At some of the schools that we're recruiting from, that grit isn't as common.
876
And we've made that mistake many times.
877
Third is: I'm going to mash a whole bunch of stuff together, but it's like emotional intelligence, self-awareness, ability to get along with people.
878
We've also got that.
879
When we've had big failures, we've missed that one.
880
So those are probably the three big ones.
881
Surprising one would be probably just a bias for action.
882
So getting in the arena, trying stuff.
883
It fails, try again, versus this analysis paralysis.
884
If you think about marketing to these people, like how you get, obviously you would want to monopolize people that have that trait to come on one of your companies.
885
That would be a great virtuous cycle.
886
How do you do that?
887
Is it just word of mouth?
888
Are you more deliberate about it?
889
The answer is it's word of mouth.
890
One of the students goes and has a great experience running a business.
891
Their friend hears about Alpine, calls them.
892
I can't believe this even exists.
893
And it is as or better than advertised.
894
And that word of mouth, so the best thing we can do is just deliver on the experience, starting with giving them a winnable game and a lot of support.
895
I think last year, this would be surprising probably to you, but Alpine was the number one most applied-to-job at Harvard Business School, Stanford Business School, Kellogg Business School, the Alpine CEO and Training Program.
896
Yeah, yeah.
897
I mean, you've literally like short-circuited the front part of that search fund process.
898
Yeah, exactly.
899
Which is a pain in the butt.
900
It is a pain in the butt.
901
Yeah.
902
It's also so interesting that in that process, like you said, you said it as they have to build a private equity firm and then abandon it.
903
Exactly.
904
Yeah.
905
They don't get to reuse the skill that they built.
906
Build it to do one deal.
907
And, you know, the other thing is they can just do something on a way bigger scale.
908
They're going to run something much bigger in this, and they're going to hopefully get there a lot faster.
909
Yeah.
910
Can we spend a while talking about your class at Stanford?
911
So I think you took Irv Grossbeck's class, who was the father of search funds.
912
And maybe first talk about him, anything you learned from him, the nature of this class, and then I have lots of questions about how you run it.
913
I would say Irv is one of the most influential people in my life.
914
And I would also say there's probably literally without hyperbole, probably a thousand people that would say that same thing.
915
I don't know anyone else that that's true of.
916
And you sit down with Irv, and you are the most important person in the world for that period of time.
917
He remembers everything from your last conversation.
918
He later told me he takes notes afterwards and then reviews them before he meets you again.
919
He just cares, right?
920
So he remembers everything from your last conversation.
921
He's always the voice of, you've got this.
922
Yeah, you've got this.
923
I've seen all these students.
924
And I can't tell you how many times in my career where I've been down and out and gone and met with him.
925
And just, he just gives me a shot in the arm that I needed at the right time.
926
And from someone that you believe it when he says it.
927
So he's incredible.
928
So my experience was I was a case guest in his class, and the case was about buying companies in my dorm room and all the stuff that went wrong.
929
And I don't think Irv would say this, but I think I was like the token failure case in the corner where it was like, you know, all these people are just praying the champions.
930
And I'm this like 28-year-old that just gets my teeth kicked in again and again.
931
So he probably wouldn't say that.
932
But now that I teach there, I think that's the role I played in the curriculum.
933
One funny story, too.
934
When I first started teaching his case, I was young.
935
I was 29.
936
I knew a lot of people in the class because I'm basically the same age.
937
One of the students told me, like, in the wrap-up of my case, one of the takeaways was: as you can see from Graham, you don't really need to have charisma or be articulate to be a CEO.
938
That was one of the takeaways.
939
I was so nervous and stumbling over my words and stuff.
940
But anyway, so yeah, I mean, the class was amazing.
941
And then I was a case guest in his class for 12 years.
942
And then he was going to go start a new class.
943
And he called me one day and was like, Hey, Graham, do you want to teach my class?
944
I was almost immediately going to say no because I'm like, yeah, I already have a full-time job.
945
But I thankfully said, I'll think about it.
946
I thought about it for a week and I was like, I light up every time I'm in that classroom.
947
And I don't think I'll ever have this chance again.
948
And I ended up teaching.
949
I know it's like one of the most popular classes there now.
950
How did you build it?
951
Same set of questions, kind of as for Al.
952
What do you hope the class does for the students and how do you architect it to achieve that goal?
953
In the first four years, I just wanted to learn how to be a professor and teach.
954
I had so many limiting beliefs, like thinking I'm not a professor, I've never taught.
955
And so I just was probably the first four years, I was just trying to be like a B plus in that.
956
And the curriculum is largely around how to be a CEO, things like hiring, firing, having difficult conversations.
957
It's not big strategic things.
958
It's kind of like at the one foot level.
959
Like you're going to have a conversation with an employee about getting demoted or whatever it is, and we're going to role play that actual conversation.
960
So it's really like granular people stuff.
961
It is the important stuff as a CEO.
962
So it was a great class.
963
So I did that for four years.
964
And then what I realized is students love the class, but they weren't doing it.
965
They were like, oh, that was a great class.
966
Thanks for that.
967
And then their dream was to go run something and they didn't go run something.
968
So I said, I need to add something else to this class.
969
I want to help students figure out what their dream really is and spend a bunch of time on that.
970
And so we talked about this a little bit earlier, but a big part of the class is really giving the students some space and asking questions and having them do exercises, visualizations, and some other exercises to truly figure out what the thing is that they're excited about.
971
Like if they could do anything over the next 10 years, what would that be?
972
And that takes some time.
973
We spend a bunch of time on that.
974
They have to keep a journal and we have a bunch of classes and visualizations.
975
And then when they get kind of clear on that, immediately they're going to have all these doubts and fears and limiting beliefs.
976
Their head's going to talk them out of it.
977
And so we go right at that.
978
Hey, what are the obstacles?
979
How do we overcome that?
980
How do we design a path to go do that?
981
So that's probably 25% of the class now.
982
And I think that's probably the students.
983
You've told me before some of these incredible framing questions to like expand the mind beyond incremental thinking into more like blank sheet thinking.
984
One of the ones you told me that I liked best that I've thought about a lot since is: imagine you have nine lives.
985
You're just going to do this life.
986
What do you want to do in the second life and in the third life?
987
And like really make it feel bigger, more expansive.
988
Are there other questions like that one that you found to be the most effective to get people to like give you the real answer to what you're trying to help them find, which is like the thing that's burning inside them?
989
Yeah, what's cool about the nine lives exercise is I think people get really intimidated by saying, you got to find your passion.
990
And then I got one thing.
991
And they get in their head.
992
And I'm like, okay, well, let's say you had nine.
993
They can rattle them off like right away.
994
Okay.
995
Do this.
996
You know, I'd be a professor and I'd be a lawyer and I'd start this business.
997
I'd do a nonprofit.
998
They could come up with them like right away.
999
And then I'm like, good news.
1000
Oh, let's do those.
1001
Yeah, good news.
1002
Your thing is in there somewhere.
1003
And then we try to take those nine and talk about which ones they have the most energy for.
1004
Who are they going to meet along the way?
1005
How are they going to grow?
1006
And I mean, a great example is a student of mine.
1007
One of their lives is the thing they did before school.
1008
They're going to be a convertible bond salesperson.
1009
Life number three was run a business.
1010
And as they started learning, how are they going to grow and learn?
1011
The convertible bond one wasn't as interesting.
1012
Even though they were going to make more money doing that initially, you can dig into those nine lives.
1013
And then it's just a lower stakes way to kind of get them to something they're passionate about.
1014
And the secret is you can have all nine at some point in your life, just not all at the same time.
1015
And then other questions, we do visualizations, which you go out 20 years and we spend some real time on this.
1016
You're meeting your future self 20 years from now and your future self has just been incredibly successful and everything's worked out and you really spend some time on like, what does that look like?
1017
And then you come back and say, well, what advice did that feel like?
1018
The advice is always go do this thing, or hey, relax, it's going to work out, or don't stress about these things.
1019
So we do exercises like that.
1020
Some of the key questions are: what would you do if you knew you wouldn't fail?
1021
Relaxing the how, not worrying about how to get there, the nine lives, you know, there's a whole bunch of those.
1022
They're incredibly powerful.
1023
And I'm curious how you've learned to administer them.
1024
Do you personally have to do it one-on-one with the student, or is it more scalable than that?
1025
It's both.
1026
So there's a lot we can do in the class, and then they can break out into groups and do some one-on-one stuff.
1027
Earlier in the quarter, I have a class just on coaching where they learn how to be like a good enough executive coach for each other.
1028
We have a whole class on that.
1029
So then throughout the quarter, when they have to coach each other, they have some core skills.
1030
So I can do that for an entire group.
1031
And then I do tons of one-on-one meetings.
1032
My one-on-one meetings are typically, they're almost always the same.
1033
The student comes in and says, they ask the same question, which is like, what should I do with my life?
1034
Number one question I could ask.
1035
Great question.
1036
And then they say, okay, I have path A and I have path B, and I'm torn.
1037
I spend a few minutes with them asking some questions.
1038
In 10 minutes, it's clear that their heart wants to do B, but their head's talking them out of it.
1039
And A is the kind of safe thing.
1040
And then we just spend the rest of the time trying to unpack how they can do A in a lower risk way and that sort of thing.
1041
And that's the framework I use in the class as well.
1042
How has being a teacher changed you personally?
1043
What are the takeaways that you have?
1044
Like, how are you different as a thinker, as a person, because of this experience that you've had with all these students?
1045
Hundreds of them, sure, of students, thousands.
1046
Every quarter I learn the most.
1047
I try to make each class and each quarter be a reflection of the best I've got.
1048
This is my 12th year teaching.
1049
I'm trying to like use it as a way for me almost like to personally share my latest and greatest frameworks and thinking on really everything from everything from running a company to personal growth to spirituality.
1050
You know, I'm trying to bring everything I can.
1051
So it's a forcing function that almost makes me download an entire year of reflection into 19 classes and bring the best that I can.
1052
So just the process of that reflection and having to codify it has made me learn it better.
1053
And the other thing is, I have to practice it.
1054
I can't stand up in front of class and say, if you're running this business, you can't have B plus people in your key roles in your executive team.
1055
And then I look in the mirror and I'm thinking, okay, I got two B plus people.
1056
Follow your own advice.
1057
Yeah, I do.
1058
I do follow.
1059
I have this thing where I really can't stand up in front of class and say something either I'm not doing or don't believe.
1060
And then sometimes it's a good mirror to look at my own life and make sure I'm living that way.
1061
What is your relationship with the students like after the fact?
1062
Do lots of them come work for you?
1063
This is a very common story you hear, especially at Harvard and Stanford, it seems, and other schools too, of someone teaching and that they're doing it usually for the right reason, but it ends up being tremendous fuel for their business because of the talent.
1064
Have you had that happen to you?
1065
The way it became a fuel for talent isn't because I was going out and recruiting my students.
1066
It was because I was meeting with enough students to learn what they really care about, what they're passionate about.
1067
And then that helped me design a role at Alpine that was directly catering to the things that students wanted at the level that the students were.
1068
Cool.
1069
Because I understood that really well.
1070
So that's how it was helpful: I could say, wow, there's all these MBAs who want to be CEOs.
1071
And it just happened to marry up really great with our strategy, which has like all these $12 to $20 million revenue.
1072
You couldn't ask for a better training ground.
1073
That's how it was helpful.
1074
Mechanically, it works out really well because we do all of our recruiting at Alpine in the fall.
1075
So by the time my class comes around in the winter, students either have a job or they don't at Alpine.
1076
So they're not, my class is not a job interview, which is really important to me.
1077
I draw a line.
1078
I never interview students.
1079
I don't even ever give feedback on students.
1080
When I'm teaching, I'm really just there to be their professor.
1081
The calendar works out that I can do it that way.
1082
Your whole affect and the story and the setup, it just so rings of athletics.
1083
And you said personal growth.
1084
Somehow in the world of sports, it seems obvious and cool that LeBron would have 25 coaches and spend all this money on his body and do all this stuff to get better, like nod our heads.
1085
Like it sounds obvious.
1086
And then somehow in the professional world, there still seems to be like a stigma of sorts associated with personal growth and executive coaching.
1087
Why do you think that is?
1088
The two aren't fundamentally that different, but there doesn't seem to be the same appreciation for the potential value of something like coaching.
1089
The first coach I had in 2009, I sat across the table from him.
1090
His name is J.P.
1091
Flom, and he pitched me on being an executive coach.
1092
And I remember thinking, what the hell is an executive coach?
1093
What are you going to do?
1094
And to this day, I don't even know why I signed up.
1095
I think he was just a really compelling person.
1096
You bought the salesman, not the executive.
1097
I bought the salesman.
1098
I bought this salesperson.
1099
I think most of the people that probably have negative things to say have actually never done it.
1100
I don't think I've ever met anyone who actually hired a very high-quality coach and had anything.
1101
So, if you think about the reason you do it or have done it and have all these coaches that are part of your business or whatever, can you define personal growth?
1102
Like, what does that actually mean?
1103
So, for me, a number of different coaches I use for different things, but I'll give you a couple of real examples.
1104
So, I have a coach, named Mandy Shoemaker, and just to have a call with her, I have to fill out a form that says, What are your one-year goals?
1105
What did you say you were going to do last week?
1106
What did you do?
1107
And what are you going to do this week?
1108
And what's the outcome of the call?
1109
And just filling that out every week, if I never even talked to her, would be a great accountability.
1110
And then, obviously, she's an amazing coach.
1111
She came up through the Tony Robbins system.
1112
So, for her, it's like a personal trainer for your goals and your life.
1113
What better investment is there than that?
1114
I don't need a personal trainer to go to the gym, but I actually do need a personal trainer to like grab me and say, What are your goals?
1115
Are you sticking to them?
1116
Are you on track?
1117
I think that's really valuable.
1118
I'm not able to get there by myself without a coach.
1119
Then, I have another coach I use.
1120
We will set aside four hours, and this will be like really blue sky, messy thinking.
1121
Sometimes nothing comes out of it.
1122
We ask big questions like, what do we want Al Penn to be 10 years from now?
1123
What do you want your life to look like 10 years from now?
1124
Where are you getting on track, off track?
1125
If you were going to achieve your 10-year goals in six months, what would be true?
1126
Just these really big questions.
1127
Sometimes amazing things come out of that.
1128
Sometimes amazing things come out of that three days later in the shower.
1129
But I like making space to have that.
1130
And I just enjoy that too.
1131
So, it's like a way to put space on my calendar.
1132
You activate different parts of your brain when you talk than when you think or read.
1133
So, just the act of having another coach, you're actually.
1134
I haven't, at every step of the way, I'm running a business that's bigger than I've ever run before.
1135
She's run, she's been the chief people officer at really large companies.
1136
So she can help guide me through, like, hey, this org chart makes no sense.
1137
And here's some ways you could be thinking about it.
1138
I want to come back to the definition question again.
1139
Personal growth.
1140
What does that mean?
1141
Let's see what you say.
1142
Get better.
1143
What does better mean?
1144
I'll go like a little bit deep here, but I think that ultimately each of us has most of the answers inside of us in our intuition.
1145
Like, I think we have this compass, and you could call it your intuition, your soul, whatever that is, that's incredibly powerful.
1146
It's like our own LLM.
1147
It's taken every experience and every input we've ever had, and it's storing all this, and it has all the answers.
1148
And so I think a lot of personal growth is understanding what that intuition is telling you and spending the space and time to really understand what it's saying and getting out of your head, which is a lot of times confusing things.
1149
And then having the courage to go do what it says.
1150
That's probably my highest level of personal growth.
1151
Because I think if you can do that over and over, you'll self-actualize and become the best version of yourself, for lack of a better word.
1152
And then there's a whole bunch of things underneath that to try to make that happen.
1153
What are some of those things?
1154
Some of those things are designing, being really intentional about your life, figuring out what a successful life looks like for you in all your different areas, and really spending time on that and designing it.
1155
And then having a practice where you're working toward that almost on a daily basis.
1156
Is there an episode of the second part of the description?
1157
Courage.
1158
It's a key word, it seems like, that stands out in your memory.
1159
Like, what does that mean in practice for you?
1160
What's a time that you felt like a thing you, your intuition told you, and then it required courage, which is a big, big-I mean, I'll tell you, like, a really early one.
1161
This is the first one that came to mind when you just asked the question, but it was an early one.
1162
So, I'm in Toledo, Ohio, and to be the popular and be the cool kids, they didn't care at all about school.
1163
A lot of them were drinking, doing drugs.
1164
Some of them just really weren't nice kids, they were bullies.
1165
In many cases, they were like the athlete group.
1166
I just remember that took a lot of courage for me to separate myself because I could have been in that popular group.
1167
I chose a different path.
1168
And at 12 or 13, for me, that took a tremendous amount of courage and isolated me.
1169
And then, I think in a very short period of time, I realized that that was the right call and that that gave me just so much confidence in listening to that gut from then on.
1170
I still try to tap into that.
1171
But I think, I think at a pretty early age, I just got a sense of like how powerful it was to just listen to that voice.
1172
If we have this amazing onboard intuition, LLM, and then courage we can learn or something over time, it seems like the other key step here is asking the right questions of the intuition.
1173
I'm curious about two things: what you've learned about that part, like how to get to good questions.
1174
And then I'm also curious, zoom into today, what those questions are for you today.
1175
Your head is a really powerful tool, it'll talk you out of a lot of things.
1176
Three really simple ones.
1177
So, first off, to get into your intuition, a lot of times it's meditating, breath work, really being still and quiet, and getting out of your mind, and a lot of things that people have talked about for thousands and thousands of years.
1178
So, that's a part of it: to try to get yourself in that state where you're silencing your mind.
1179
But if you had to jump to just questions, which is a form as well, it's some of the ones we talked about: like what would I do if I wasn't afraid?
1180
What am I afraid of?
1181
How is fear playing into my life right now?
1182
There's a great call-you-in-quote, where your fear is, there is your task.
1183
Usually, look at where something is holding you back that you're afraid of and go into that and toward that thing.
1184
Your work is going to be in there versus running away from it.
1185
A good question, just using kind of your future self.
1186
Okay, I have this decision to make going left or right.
1187
And right now, I'm in the fog of war, and it's scary.
1188
And gosh, it's going to be really hard to go either direction.
1189
But stepping out and saying, Okay, if your 10 years older version of yourself were to give you advice right now, what would they want you to do?
1190
And so, you're getting out of like the immediate fog of war.
1191
And a lot of times the answer is super clear.
1192
So, those are all just a few questions or tools that might help.
1193
The point on fear and being afraid or whatever makes me realize we talked about an amazing deal.
1194
What was like a terrible early deal?
1195
We had a lot of deals that just didn't go well, but probably the worst deal we did was this slot machine business that we owned.
1196
It was the worst deal, it wasn't economically the worst deal, but it just was so consuming.
1197
So, we put money in the slot machine business, made them manufactured.
1198
They made basically software that went into slot machines, and then they assembled the slot machines somewhere else and put them in casinos.
1199
They put them in a rev share, so we give away the machine for quote-free, and then you get 20% of the win.
1200
So, it had a recurring revenue element to it.
1201
It was on paper a good business.
1202
We sold to Native American tribes, which was exploding at the time.
1203
This was probably the early 2000s.
1204
Native American tribes.
1205
But there was just something, and I'm sorry, I'm going to probably offend a lot of people here, but there's just something about that industry where there was still an undercurrent of some people that weren't playing by the rules.
1206
A few things were tough about that.
1207
Number one is we just had way too much money in it.
1208
We had co-invest in the deal.
1209
We were in a $68 million fund at the time, and we had $170 million in the business, including Co-Invest.
1210
So it was just like too big to fail.
1211
So we had to make it work.
1212
I became CEO of the business.
1213
One of my partners was basically the CFO.
1214
We had technology, we had customer concentration, we had CapEx, we had product obsolescence.
1215
It was a very hard business to run.
1216
And then there was just, again, this element of like you're competing with some people that don't follow the rules or the law.
1217
It was just this undercurrent.
1218
It just didn't feel right a lot of the time.
1219
And I still remember this one time.
1220
Someone would ask me about it.
1221
And I'd say, oh, you know, it's just entertainment and the median income of people who play slots is actually higher and they could afford it.
1222
And I'd have all those things I'd say.
1223
And then I remember this one time I walked, we had these like local casinos.
1224
And I remember one time walking in, and there was this five-year-old girl sitting outside with a coloring book, and her mom was in there blowing her paycheck.
1225
I just was like, I don't want to be in this business.
1226
It consumed a lot of our time.
1227
That was probably the worst deal we ever did.
1228
It set us back quite a bit.
1229
How did you work it out?
1230
What was the end of the story?
1231
We saved the deal because we read that Illinois was going to open up and put slot machines in bars.
1232
And Illinois is like the fifth or sixth most populous state in the U.S.
1233
We were like, oh my God, this is going to happen.
1234
It was going to happen in like a year.
1235
Then it was two years and three years.
1236
So we'd pay them X dollars to have the rights to put slots in their bars.
1237
And we were like three years ahead of time, ahead of people.
1238
So then, when the, thankfully, the law finally passed and the games came out, we were the largest or second largest supplier in that market.
1239
And then we were able to sell the business on the back of that.
1240
Did you earn a return on the equity on the 170?
1241
Initial equity was about a 3X, and then some of the late equity was like a 1X.
1242
Everybody, the banks got paid back.
1243
Every one of our investors made their money.
1244
Plus, we had some preferred equity, they got all paid.
1245
So it was like, we did escape, but yeah, we never want to bet our business on one thing.
1246
So in addition to the concentration lesson, is the other key lesson just don't back businesses where you're not a fan of the core product or service?
1247
Yeah.
1248
For us, you know, I want to think that we're having a, I mean, it sounds cheesy, but we're having a positive impact.
1249
The world's a little better because we're building this company.
1250
And if I'm being honest, I don't think that was true in that business.
1251
What are you most afraid of today?
1252
I told you this when we talked the other day, but my two boys went off to college, and it was like the end of a chapter that was really one of the first times I felt like I needed to start facing my mortality.
1253
And I think that's the thing I'm the most afraid of: how long do I have?
1254
And like, am I going to be able to do all the things that I want to do in this lifetime?
1255
And this is the only one that I know that we have.
1256
And am I doing that right now?
1257
Or am I going to look back and have any kind of regrets?
1258
That's probably the thing I'm the most afraid of.
1259
What have you done about that?
1260
I'm in the process of it, honestly.
1261
Like, I think one of the things I've done about it is I try to, whatever I'm in at the moment, just be 100% fully on and fully present and just be all in with 1000% of my.
1262
And I think that's been the thing that I guess has allowed me to feel the best about immortality.
1263
Is there anything, if I think of like pillars supporting the ability to do that day in, day out as like a human biological thing that has limited energy or whatever?
1264
This could be anything, what you eat, what you do, whatever the pillars are, what are those pillars for you that let you do that?
1265
I think one of the pillars is that you have spent the time being intentional and spent the time getting in touch with your intuition so that you just know the things you're working on are the things and you don't have to be hedged at all.
1266
You're not spending your time.
1267
Am I in the right job?
1268
Am I in the right relationship?
1269
Am I living in the right place?
1270
You've already answered those questions.
1271
So you can just kind of relax into those things.
1272
So a lot of the work that I do on that has allowed me to relax in those things.
1273
I think the physical part is massive.
1274
I think the most highly correlated thing to having a good day is if I feel good physically.
1275
That starts with sleeping well.
1276
And then there's a whole lot of things you back up from sleeping well.
1277
So I don't drink alcohol.
1278
I don't drink caffeine.
1279
I don't take sleeping pills.
1280
I have a nighttime routine.
1281
I try not to schedule stuff early in the morning that's going to stress me out.
1282
I think that is so underrated.
1283
How you feel physically matters a ton.
1284
If I go back to our teal versus Schwarzenegger analogy, my experience with the Schwarzeneggers of the world is that the structure of their days matters a tremendous amount, typically a lot more than the teals.
1285
Maybe could you give us like a day in the life?
1286
Let's say a normal day of work or something, a Tuesday, in some detail.
1287
What does a day in the life look like?
1288
A normal day, I'm waking up with no alarm, hopefully sleep in eight hours.
1289
So maybe I go to bed at 10 or 9.
1290
I'm having a somewhat relaxed morning that's going to include at least 15 minutes of meditating and then I work out.
1291
And I try to work out really hard.
1292
I try to distract.
1293
Yeah.
1294
I try to like ease into my workout.
1295
enough and warm up that at some point in that workout, no matter what it is, I'm going hard for at least something.
1296
Because it just, I don't know, it has some kind of impact on me that I enjoy.
1297
And then if I'm successful, I have my day start a little later, like 9 or 10, so that I have a little time in the morning to just kind of gather myself and get organized.
1298
And then like, I have this habit I've done since I was 12.
1299
I write out what are the three most important things you're doing this year and what are the three things you're doing today to move toward those things.
1300
I write that list.
1301
Every day.
1302
Every day.
1303
Weekends?
1304
Probably not weekends, yeah.
1305
Weekdays.
1306
I have it all on one note.
1307
And then I try to just compare my schedule to that.
1308
I look at the things I have on my calendar.
1309
Hopefully I'm prepared for those things.
1310
And then I try to just be present throughout the day.
1311
And in that day, if I think about the archetypes, a second, like pairing of archetypes for people running investment firms, you have a category of investor-focused people and more like what I would call CEO running a business that happens to do investing as its thing versus people that are like doing the deals.
1312
So like very famously, like Schwartzmann or the KKR founders, they were kind of CEOs from day one.
1313
They were really like deal people.
1314
They were of course involved.
1315
It was more about building the machine than executing the individual deals.
1316
And I know you've done both, but if you think about the day in the life today, like if I looked at your meeting, how does it break down between, wow, we're making this huge equity investment, like talk about the company versus talking about Alpine?
1317
That's an awesome question.
1318
I'm just going to go back for a second on that.
1319
The leader of every single one of those firms looked at their job as being a deal person trying to close deals.
1320
And in many ways, they almost were competitive with me and like, my deal's better, and I'm going to have, I'm going to grab your analyst because, you know, whatever.
1321
And they spent virtually no time, if any time, saying, how do I make this the place where the best people want to stay?
1322
And I remember the last place I worked, if they had spent 25% of their time doing that, they'd probably have the best returns.
1323
And so I remember thinking that, tucking that away in my head and thinking, gosh, so to answer your question, I think that's the most important part of my job is, is Alpine the place where the best people want to come and work and spend their lives and their careers?
1324
That's the most important part of my job.
1325
And then similarly with our portfolio companies, which are really an extension of us, because we're putting our own teams in there, are those a place where we can attract the very, very best people?
1326
I spend a lot of my time on that.
1327
How are we structuring the deal teams?
1328
What does career advancement look like?
1329
How are we recruiting, meeting with the world-class people on our team and trying to say, hey, how are things going?
1330
What's working well?
1331
What's not?
1332
And then that's a big part of my day.
1333
But to answer your question specifically, I have gone through periods where I'm doing, I mean, the first 10 years at Alpine, I just did deals.
1334
And then I've gone through periods where I wasn't working on deals and wasn't on boards.
1335
I think for me, the right balance is to probably spend around 25% of my time in the action because I think it's good for me to keep one hand in the action so I can know what it's like building one of these companies and what problems they're facing.
1336
I don't want to be totally out of that.
1337
And then I'm spending probably 75% of my time working on Alpine itself.
1338
Where do you think private equity is going?
1339
It's a very interesting time in the news because Yale and others have just.
1340
I mean, it is professionalized, mature, huge.
1341
There's huge public companies that do this.
1342
When you started Alpine, it was very much still in whatever earlier innings, let's say.
1343
How would you describe it today?
1344
What does it kind of feel like to you, having been in it a while?
1345
Where do you think it might go?
1346
Well, if you go back to when I started, say, 1990, I started in 94, but let's say 1990, I think the 10-year treasury was around 8%.
1347
Then you watched over the subsequent 30 years from 90 to 2020, interest rates steadily went down.
1348
I mean, they had a little few spikes, but they went basically from 8% to zero over a very steady period of time throughout that.
1349
And that had two massive impacts.
1350
One is the pension funds pretty much all underwrote their pensions at 8% or 9%.
1351
I don't know why they picked that number, but they all did.
1352
And all of a sudden, your risk-free rates at zero.
1353
You have to find alternatives.
1354
And so over that same period of time, that last 30 years, you had allocations just steadily increasing.
1355
It was a biggest tailwind.
1356
I mean, over that time, Caliper's probably went from a 0% allocation to, I don't know, 20% allocation.
1357
That's a lot of money.
1358
Multiply that by foundations, endowments, and everybody.
1359
And so you had this just massive tailwind.
1360
And then the second one, the obvious one, is debt was really cheap.
1361
And so that's a big part of the private equity model, and borrowing was cheap.
1362
And so you had multiple expansion over that entire period of time.
1363
I don't care what anyone says, there was multiple expansion.
1364
I mean, we were buying the same companies in 1994 at five times that we're paying 13 times for now and excited about to do so.
1365
So you had that trend going on over that same period of time, and therefore, returns were good, generally speaking.
1366
That's dynamic one.
1367
And then dynamic two is there's a dynamic.
1368
It's very early and it's tiny dollars, but individuals are starting to be able to go into private equity through their wealth management, which didn't used to be a thing.
1369
I think the impact of all that is that the people who were putting up median returns and felt like they had this God-given right to raise their next fund and it was going to be bigger.
1370
I think that's not going to work out very well in the next decade or so.
1371
I think you're going to have to be pretty differentiated.
1372
Or the really, really massive firms that are able to collect the money from the individuals, which is the new tailwind coming in, I think they're going to be able to mass assets.
1373
But I think it's hard.
1374
It's gotten harder every single year.
1375
I've been in it for 31 years.
1376
I think it's going to get even harder just given some of the potential headwinds of interest rates.
1377
One of the themes here has been between your class and Alpine and the talent program, all these things, requires that you see the best in people.
1378
What have you found are the keys to doing that specific thing well?
1379
I think one of my probably favorite things is when I went back, when I was telling you earlier about Irv Grossbeck and how at certain times in my life, I would walk in and ask for his advice.
1380
And he would tell me, Hey, I've seen a lot of students.
1381
I've seen a lot of people.
1382
You've got this.
1383
Coming from him, like, I would believe it.
1384
It would matter that he said that.
1385
I think a big part of it, Patrick, is we get to be that force now for these MBAs who are coming in and saying, Hey, look, here's been your track record.
1386
We've done this a lot.
1387
You're going to be awesome at this.
1388
You're ready.
1389
We're going to help you go do that.
1390
And then it becomes somewhat self-fulfilling.
1391
The students believe it and they.
1392
So I think seeing the best in people is really one of my favorite things about Alpine.
1393
Our passion statement at Alpine is unleashing heroes.
1394
And so we think that the people we're bringing on at Alpine and our companies really are heroes and they haven't had the arena yet to really like fully be the hero that they can be.
1395
If you think about the industry as a big participant in it, are there any parts of it that really bother you?
1396
Are there features of the private equity investing style, landscape industry, whatever that you think are messed up?
1397
Yeah, there's a lot.
1398
I think that, gosh, there's so much money in the business that it's just very, very hard to not get distracted by that.
1399
So if you really think about, I was talking about before about the objective statement and how much that matters, I think if you watch what firms do, maybe not what they say, but what they actually do, their objective statement is go raise the next fund, go raise a bigger fund.
1400
I think that that makes sense.
1401
That's how they stay in business, but I think it can lead to the wrong behaviors.
1402
Specifically, you cut your flowers and water your weeds.
1403
You show these great realized returns and you're compounding your stuff that's not great.
1404
It leads to a lot of people that come in the industry and maybe are in it to make money as opposed to build things or don't always show up the best way sometimes.
1405
Anything we haven't talked about that you feel like is an essential part of your story, Alpine's story, ingredients of success as the style of investor that we haven't?
1406
I mean, I think probably the biggest thing is it just took a long time.
1407
Through the first 14 years at Alpine, I had seven years of private equity before that.
1408
So I'm 21 years in the industry.
1409
21 years in.
1410
21 years in.
1411
I mean, 21 years in, my salary was $100,000.
1412
That's a fact.
1413
And we hadn't yet had a carry check because our European waterfall.
1414
And so waiting for the last company, which was our best one, it just took a long time.
1415
I think Alpine is a success story.
1416
A lot of it is because we just stayed with it for a long period of time and we're constantly growing and learning through that entire time.
1417
I think that's something that at least my students and I think a lot of people miss is they probably hear people on your show who sound really successful because they are, but they may not really understand that it doesn't just happen.
1418
Like it takes a long time.
1419
And I think giving people the perspective going into starting a company that it's going to take a long time and be ready for that ride.
1420
So pick something you're excited about that you want to stay with for a long time because if you're in it to make money and exit, you're probably going to be disappointed.
1421
Doesn't that pair beautifully with your questions for your class though?
1422
The lifetime questions or whatever that for you to go 21 years and be making 100 grand, obviously you love part of it.
1423
Like you wouldn't have kept going otherwise.
1424
So it seems like there's quite a nice pairing there.
1425
Absolutely.
1426
I mean, again, not to get too philosophical, but the real journey, the real part of your life is the journey, the building, not knowing how it's going to turn out and the challenges you face.
1427
When you look back, that's all the fun stuff.
1428
And so you wouldn't even want it to go great in the first year because I think you'd be depressed.
1429
I think you want it to take a while and you want to learn because what's happening along the way is you're growing and you're learning who you are and you're building your own confidence and your own results.
1430
I was reading some of my old Alan Watts notes this morning around philosophy.
1431
I found this quote, which was so good, which is the point of dancing is not to get to a particular spot on the dance floor.
1432
I love, I love that story.
1433
He talks about dancing is so awesome.
1434
And he says, you're not rewarding the fastest dancer, right?
1435
He says that in that quote.
1436
When I do these, I always ask the same traditional closing question.
1437
What is the kindest thing that anyone's ever done for you?
1438
First thing that comes to mind was last year, my wife's out of town, and I have my middle son, Blake, and Lily.
1439
We're at home.
1440
So it's just the three of us.
1441
We had these crazy power storms going on.
1442
I get up in the morning early.
1443
I drive down to Stanford and Blake calls me and I'm like, oh no, what's happening?
1444
And he says, hey, school's canceled.
1445
There's no power.
1446
And I said, okay, no problem.
1447
Just, you know, make sure you drop your sister off somewhere and she couldn't drive, you know, before you go wherever you're going to do.
1448
Just make sure she's okay.
1449
And he's like, no, dad, Lily and I want to come down and watch your class.
1450
I just remember thinking, wow, you know, these two teenagers who could have done whatever they wanted on their day off, they're going to drive an hour and a half and come hang out with me at Stanford.
1451
And I don't know.
1452
It just really, really moved me.
1453
And it meant the world to me.
1454
Amazing.
1455
Amazing place to close.
1456
It's so cool how you've built what you've built with some simple ideas just taken very, very seriously over long periods of time.
1457
I think that lesson is especially powerful.
1458
So thank you for telling us the entire story and so cool what you built.
1459
Thanks for doing this.
1460
