Today we're dropping a special episode in the Invest the Best feed.
2
50X is Back, a fan favorite series from Will Thorndike and the team at Compounding Labs.
3
Will's book, The Outsiders, is one of the best business and investing books that you'll ever read.
4
You'll hear him continuing his work in the hosting chair as he looks in detail at investments that have appreciated at least 50-fold.
5
Season two features Assurion.
6
Colossus is excited to partner with Will as he sits down with the management and investors behind this legendary investment.
7
We kick off this special drop with a short interview that I did with Will on everything he learned studying this business, followed by the full three-part series.
8
Make sure to subscribe to 50X in your preferred podcast player and look out for Will's upcoming interviews on Joyzo Compounding, where he goes into even more behind-the-scenes detail.
9
An often overlooked pattern among power law companies such as Assurion is an ethic of frugality and cost vigilance.
10
We relish the story of former Capital City CEO Tom Murphy painting only the two sides of his Albany TV station that faced the road.
11
While CEOs in the past needed such dramatic examples to emphasize the importance of cost control, CEOs today are blessed to have a platform RAMP, which can provide expense visibility across the entire company in real time, using powerful software to close books faster, control excess spending, and facilitate cost comparison.
12
RAMP is the finance partner your organization needs.
13
On top of cost cutting, RAMP is also designed for efficiency.
14
The average finance team spends 200 hours per year on expense reports, time they could be spending on strategic activities.
15
If you're still manually processing expenses in 2025, that is valuable time, which is simply not being used efficiently.
16
RAMP's corporate card eliminates all of this waste using automation and engineering.
17
One chief financial officer told me they cut their month-end close from five days to one thanks to RAMP's platform.
18
Over 25,000 businesses trust RAMP, including Shopify, CBRE, and Dural.

This episode is brought to you by Oberly Risk Strategies, a specialty insurance brokerage providing insurance services to search funds, independent sponsors, family offices, and private equity firms.
21
I have a fun personal connection to Oberly.
22
About 15 years ago, I partnered with Oberly's founder and CEO, August Felker, as an investor in his traditional search fund.
23
After a successful exit, August decided to build Oberly, the brokerage he wished had existed during his own search.
24
Oberly offers a comprehensive insurance due diligence package custom designed for private equity and the search fund community.
25
Additionally, Oberly has a thriving personal lines practice designed for entrepreneurs seeking a higher level of service and expertise when it comes to insuring one's home, vehicles, and valuables.
26
Speaking from experience, August's energy and passion around high-quality customer service and operational excellence is impressive.
27
He knows firsthand the key issues, timelines, and risks around acquiring a business and has built Oberly into a leading insurance firm in the MA advisory space.

34
So Will, I thought ahead of your release of 50X on Assurion, which is an investment that is one of the most remarkable in history that people will love the story when they hear about it, that we should record to hear you reflect on it a little bit.
35
You've been a big part of this investment journey too, even though you're the Virgil in the 50X context.
36
You too have been a key investor in the business over the long period of time.
37
Maybe you could just give us your overview of your personal experience with this company and with this investment.
38
Asurian was an extremely early investment for me.
39
I made it very early in the first stage of the private equity firm I was involved with building, Housatonic Partners, at a time when we were making our investments on a deal-by-deal basis, which is an important detail because what it meant is we were making them out of a serial LLC structure, which had no fund life.
40
So we had the structural luxury of being able to hold these investments for long periods of time and we made eight investments that way.
41
And that investment turns 30 in July of this year.
42
Wow.
43
Okay, keep going.
44
Very far back for me.
45
And it's a remarkable story.
46, the way I would frame it, so, this is an investment that was originally made out of a search fund in the very early days of search funds.
47, this is deal number five or six, maybe seven in the history of search.
48
So, super early days.
49
And if you looked at all of the search companies that have been bought in the ensuing years, there are hundreds of them.
50
That number, in fact, is closing in quickly on a thousand.
51
If you were going to score them, we use something, a very simple metric for scoring growth equity transactions generally, but search fund transactions specifically, we call the power ratio, which is very simply the trailing revenue growth rate divided by the EBITDA multiple paid.
52
Turns out that metric's surprisingly predictive over time.
53
And we're basically looking for a ratio there of two to three X.
54
Just to frame that, core private equity would score under one on average, 0.75x.
55
So two to 3x is attractive and interesting.
56
In the history of search, if you go back and look at the original Achurian transaction, it would be top 1% ever in power ratio, scored north of 10X.
57
So it was a remarkable company.
58
It was growing very fast, and we bought it at a low multiple.
59
It's growing north of 50% revenue-wise.
60
We bought it at around five times EBITDA.
61
And in this business, EBITDA and free cash flow are pretty close.
62
So it was exceptional in that dimension.
63
And it was sitting in front of this amazing, high-probability, secularly growing TAM market.
64
So basically, the growth in cellular penetration.
65
Investment was made, as we said, in the middle of 95.
66
There were 27 million cellular customers at that point in time.
67
In the podcast, we cover the first dozen years of the history at Assurion.
68
And as you'll see, that's typically for us in pretty good detail.
69
By the end of that period in time, there were 250 million.
70
So there was 10X market growth.
71
And then the business itself had exceptional economic characteristics.
72
Again, we look at three criteria in core search, as we call it, in growth buyouts.
73
We a consistent pattern of recurring revenue, consistent pattern of repeat revenue.
74
We organic revenue growth, as we're talking about.
75
And we capital efficiency.
76
And across those three dimensions, the original company, the original business at Assurion, which was known at the time as Road Rescue Inc., by the way, totally different name, scored very highly.
77
It's just a very good business sitting in front of a high-growing market.
78
So the point I would make at a high level is: given those circumstances, I think anybody would have generated pretty exceptional returns over time.
79
That being said, I think if you look at what the CEO there, Kevin Toweel, achieved over the ensuing dozen years we cover in the podcast, and really the broader 30 years, that would be a top 1% outcome.
80
You could take the best team of CEOs from anywhere, and Kevin was a graduate of the Stanford Business School, and that is extraordinary.
81
So they were dealt an extraordinary hand, but they also played it pretty uniquely well.
82
And that's the story we work to unpack in, as I say, typically deep detail in the podcast.
83
It's impossible to be totally precise about it because it's not a publicly traded business.
84
But rough justice, what a multiple of money did the investment represent from the beginning through to today?
85
It's not precise.
86
Podcast is 50X.
87
It's in the zip code of 100x, 50x.
88
100x, 50x.
89
Got it.
90
Yeah.
91
And, trans time to make the first one is now around 50x, 50x.
92
I'm going to frame that guy.
93
Yeah, pretty incredible.
94
If you think about that multiple of money, I think most people intuit that that's only available as a seed investor in Uber or something that.
95
It's a very venture- power law outcome from a business that you said you bought for five times EBITDA, five times free cash flow, really.
96
What does that teach you about that trope that that return should and does come from the world of power law technology investing versus ho-hum search fund private equity?
97
Yeah,, I think the key variable in that obviously is duration.
98
It's interesting if you go through the story, there's this fascinating period where about three years into the investment, there was an opportunity to sell it at a seemingly gaudy multiple of invested capital, a double-digit net MOIC to investors.
99
And there was a decision made at that time to not sell it and hold it.
100
Really, everything subsequently stems from that pivotal decision.
101
We unpack it in detail.
102
It's extraordinary for a group of investors.
103
And at this point, the investors were very sophisticated, many of them professional investors, but not funds in the early days.
104
They were individual investors investing their own capital.
105
But they made a cautious decision not to sell at a 12x MOIC three years in.
106
I think it'd be hard for many boards sitting around the table today to turn that down, but it ended up so the seeds for everything that followed.
107
If you think about everything you've learned across those 30 years, watching the business get built and expand, aside from just the pure power of duration, which I know is one of the key things that you personally care about and focus on, I don't mean to make light of that amazing lesson and advantage.
108
What other things did Assurian teach you that were distinct to it, maybe that you didn't have or didn't learn from other companies that you've been involved with?
109
Going back to that thing, Pat, it's a great question.
110
It's if you say, okay, well, it was dealt with this amazing circumstance, but it had this outperformance, this top 1% outcome.
111
Why?
112
And I think it's really a story of resource allocation.
113
It's the way I would think about that.
114
And I think there's three types of resources where a company under Kevin's leadership had a differentiated approach.
115
I'm not going to start with the one that you would expect me to start with, which is capital allocation.
116
I think I would start with human resource/slash talent.
117
And the company from very early on had a distinctive approach to talent.
118
Kevin, as a CEO, allocated more of his time to talent than almost any early career CEO I've spent time with.
119
So he was on that from early on, finding, proactively looking for, engaged in the truffle hunt of finding top talent for the company.
120
And this is from the first 24 to 36 months.
121
In addition to which, the company was kindly relentless in continually upgrading its talent.
122
So, this is something we get into in some detail in the podcast, but that's also code for replacing people who are no longer capable of growing in their roles, given the very rapid growth in the company.
123
So, that was part of it.
124
Very conscious approach to managing talent over time.
125
Second piece is time allocation.
126
I would drive down to CEO time allocation.
127
And I would say, still to this day, if you go to Kevin's desk, he's got one of the little yellow sticks on it, his top three priorities.
128
He's just a laser beam as it relates to his own personal time allocation.
129
And specifically, using that Eisenhower matrix framework, the important non-urgent bucket is where he spends most of his time and has from very early days in the company.
130
So, I think on those two dimensions, there's different.
131
And then, capital allocation-wise, if you look at it, there's an amazing organic engine underneath this company over time.
132
But there were critical junctures where the actual long-term MOIC was driven by different capital allocation decisions.
133
So, the two best examples of that are they made two acquisitions subsequent to the original acquisition that effectively got the business into the handset insurance business and bulletproofed its position there in an interesting way.
134
And those were exceptional acquisitions that were proactively sourced after years of proactive work.
135
And many teams would not have gotten to those acquisitions, let alone able to do them in the way that they were processed here.
136
And then, secondly, from pretty early days, the company was an active acquirer of its own shares, something that's pretty rare in private companies.
137, not that easy to do, but the company bought in pretty meaningful amounts of its stock over time.
138
This was something it had learned from a key board member here and podcast participant, Irv Grossbeck, whose own company, Continental Cable Vision, had repurchased shares privately.
139
But at about year four, and again, about three years later, it bought in almost 20% of its shares privately.
140
And it continued to do so in the years post-07 to the point where it's a very meaningful long-term contributor to the net MOIC.
141
All of those decisions and actions were unusual.
142
What did it teach you about business moats and sustainable competitive advantage and the cultivation of those things?
143
Any company that earns that return, the world's a smart place.
144
It knows where there's money being made.
145
That doesn't seem to have affected Assuran's ability to compound free cash flow per share.
146
What is it about its moat that has been so powerful?
147
Yeah, I think the company evolved this really unique B2B to see model.
148
It did an exceptional job delivering service for its clients, the ultimate clients, and for its key cellular carrier partners.
149
In both cases, it built really deep relationships through excellent execution, very metric-driven, constantly driving NPS excellence, and then consistent, extraordinary quality of its people over time.
150
There were private equity investors who got involved after the transaction, the 2007 transaction that we closed the podcast with.
151
And a number of them have commented that in interacting with the team post-investment, people three and four levels down could have run other portfolio companies of theirs.
152
Again, going back to Kevin's focus on that from early days.
153
Can you say two words each about Irv and Kevin, and both what people they are and what they've taught you?
154
So, Irv is the crispest individual I've ever interacted with in a life or business context.
155
And that in the best sense, meaning he has a genius for distilling to its essence core business ideas and broader life advice.
156
He's a distillation machine.
157
And Kevin is a unique combination of kindness.
158
He's from Canada and he's a delightful person, but with laser beam intensity underneath it.
159
So, well disguised, but there, but deeply present.
160
So, I think there would be some overlap in the strengths of those two and the reason that they had such a wonderful and long partnership.
161, Irv was effectively the lead director until 24 months ago at Assurian from the earliest days.
162
And Kevin started as a case writer for Irv at the Stanford Business School after he graduated.
163
So, there's a relationship that predates the Assurian company acquisition.
164
Final question before we get to the episode, which everyone's going to love: what is your personal favorite part about the entire Assurian story?
165
I honestly think, Patrick, it's the decision that we touched on earlier not to sell the company at 12X net MOIC to investors three-ish years in.
166
We do unpack that in much more detail in the podcast, but that was a pivotal moment.
167
Highly countercultural.
168
Well, I've listened to this twice now.
169
I think it's one of the most interesting business case studies anyone will ever encounter and has the added benefit of being one that's not widely known because the access and depth that you and your team have created are what make that possible.
170
So, thank you for doing this for all of us.
171
So many lessons to learn.
172
I hope everyone enjoys.
173
Welcome to 50X.
174
I'm your host, Will Thorndike, author of The Outsiders and a co-founder at Compounding Labs.
175
50X aims to dissect the anatomy of investments that have appreciated at least 50-fold.
176
We dive into each investment's origins, evolution, and eventual outcome, exploring key themes around long-term value creation, ranging from operations, capital allocation, and culture to pivotal purchase and sale decisions.
177
We track the often circuitous route to exceptional long-term returns and study how that rarest of investment commodities, conviction, gets created, maintained, threatened, and sometimes lost.

This podcast is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon as a basis for investment decisions.
187
So today we're going to do a deep dive on a company you may never have heard of.
188
It's called Assurion, and we're delighted to be here this morning with its co-founder, currently chairman, Kevin Tawil.
189
Assurion has several claims to fame.
190
Measured by MOIC, multiple of invested capital, a metric we obviously care deeply about on this podcast, I believe it is both the best search fund investment ever and the best institutional private equity deal.
191
The company, which was originally called Road Rescue Inc., turned 28 years old in July.
192
And for investors who held their investment for the entire holding period, their MOIC is well into the thousands.
193
To put a finer point on that, a dollar invested in the original purchase of Road Rescue in 1995 has grown at a compound annual rate of over 61% through the most recent transaction in 2021, translating into an MOIC north of 5,275x.
194
Interestingly and very unusually for us at 50X, it is a story where the predominant source of value creation came from organic growth, although that's a little bit deceptive, as we'll see.
195
Importantly, there have been two constant presences throughout that entire period: Kevin and a deeply talented lead director named Irv Grossbeck.
196
We are incredibly fortunate and grateful to have them as our guests on this episode of 50X.
197
Okay, now, full disclosure: I am both an original investor in Assurian and a close, longtime friend of both Kevin's and Irves, which doesn't mean, of course, I won't be actively grilling the Merritt Garland style on this podcast.
198
Anyway, Kevin, we're delighted to have you here.
199
Thank you for coming.
200
Thank you, Will.
201
I'm excited to be here.
202
Excellent.
203
Let's dive in.
204
So, if you don't mind, let's maybe start with a little bit of your background pre-Assurian.
205
So, I grew up in Prince Edward Island, Canada, small province on the East Coast, maybe 120,000 people.
206
And I grew up working in my dad's grocery store.
207
We had the maybe the predominant grocery store where everybody in the community came and shopped every week, and I'd be packing bags and filling shelves.
208
And that was probably where I first got to understand this idea of entrepreneurship of working for oneself.
209
Not that I saw it in a great light, because I saw my father coming home from work at five o'clock, tired.
210
He'd have dinner with us and go back to work till 10 o'clock at night, and we worked six days a week.
211
So it was all I knew.
212
I knew other friends had jobs working in the government or different businesses, and they didn't necessarily appeal to me anymore, or certainly not more than what my dad did at the time.
213
Athletics was a big part of my life.
214
Of course, hockey.
215
I'm Canadian.
216
It's in the butt.
217
It's in the water.
218
I also played soccer competitive.
219
What position in hockey?
220
I was a defenseman, all five foot eight of me.
221
I was not a large defenseman, but it was the Bobby Orr era.
222
It was.
223
It had to be fast, good vision.
224
And yeah, Bobby Ort was a superstar then.
225
But soccer was really my passion.
226
Started playing when I was 12 and immediately took to it.
227
It was a growing sport then in Canada and certainly in North America generally.
228
And I feel I learned a lot of lessons through my experiences soccer, both as a player and being coached by amazing coaches along the way.
229
So a lot of lessons learned.
230
Ended up playing for my high school team, local club teams, our provincial Canada Games team.
231
And it was also an important thread through university because it was one of the key reasons I ended up going to McGill University.
232
McGill had just won two back-to-back national championships.
233
So that was exciting for me.
234
I was a walk-on player in 1983 and I made the team, and that was just a huge, I don't know if I'd say a huge accomplishment, but I had grown up in this small pond and I was this big fish in a small pond.
235
Then I had come to Montreal and McGill, and nobody knew me, nobody knew who I was.
236
So to make it on my own without reputation behind me was super exciting and exhilarating.
237
I spent five years there at McGill taking a mechanical engineering degree.
238
What position in soccer, by the way?
239
I was center midfield.
240
I'm not sure I played defense or offense particularly well, but I was able to distribute the ball quite effectively.
241, my first year at McGill was spectacular and truly formational for me.
242
Not just from an athletic perspective, but from a mindset and business perspective.
243
I still remember these moments regularly.
244
So McGill had just come off two national championship titles, and we were clearly the number one favorite coming into the 1983 season.
245
I didn't start the first game, but when I got my shot, I think it was in the second game, I became a starter immediately.
246
It was exciting.
247
But what was truly different, there was this sense on the team that we couldn't lose.
248
It was in the air, and I'd never felt that before.
249
And you would see it.
250
There was one time we were playing one of our rivals in our home stadium.
251
We were down by two goals, and there may have been eight minutes left in the game.
252
But nobody was stressed.
253
And sure enough, our center back, I think he was from the Dominican Republic.
254
He was not a particularly talented scorer, but he came up, got the first goal, we tied it and won it in overtime.
255
And it was really remarkable to be part of that group of people who had that sense of invincibility, that sense of we can overcome any obstacle.
256
Unfortunately, in the national final, we lost in penalty kicks at the very end.
257
It was during a snowstorm in Sudbury, Ontario.
258
Not that you remember it, Renee.
259
Every single moment of it.
260
It's one of those things that you never forget.
261
Interestingly, my son plays lacrosse for Duke University, and he made it to the national final this past year.
262
I haven't told him yet that he'll remember that for a long time, but he's got two more years to make that up with a national championship.
263
Rectify.
264
Yeah.
265
Yeah.
266
And then you'll probably forget a little about the Watsons.
267
Okay, so post-McGill post-McGill, I went on to work at Solomon Brothers as a financial analyst in the two-year program.
268
That was fun.
269
Fun may not be the right word.
270
It was sport to work these young men and women as hard as they could.
271
This is the Michael Lewis era at Solomon Brothers, right?
272
Liars Poker was published when I was an Atlas there.
273
It was truly emblematic of the culture at Solomon Brothers.
274
I was not on the trading board.
275
I was in the building next to it, but the culture permeated the entire organization.
276
It was very fast, loose, very macho.
277
Not a lot of guardrails or controls in place there at the time.
278
It was an education for me and what I really didn't want.
279
It was the first time I worked for somebody else.
280
And the cultures at investment banks can be challenging, period, but it was predictably challenging with Solomon Brothers in the late 80s.
281
Not only did they have a culture where they would chew up employees as much as they could or use them as much as they could.
282
And they weren't really into developing or nurturing or building a real culture.
283
It was really all about driving near-term results.
284
It was also a time when Wall Street was declining precipitously.
285
You were coming into a recession.
286
Trexel blew up in the middle of it.
287
And you've got people being laid off.
288
And during my second year, their mergers and acquisitions group probably contracted to about half its original size in less than a year.
289
And you got to see all that happening to the point where when I was being interviewed upon my exit en route to Stanford Business School, I remember the MD asking if I'd consider coming back after business school.
290
And I just wasn't expecting that question.
291
And I just answered honestly and naively.
292
And I said, well, I suppose if I don't have any other offers, I'd come back.
293
It was just intuitive.
294
I was just, no, it was a reaction.
295
I would never want to work in that culture if I didn't have to.
296
But I learned a lot, that's for sure.
297
The thing I take away most from that era was the importance of getting it right, of doing work at a high level and checking your work, making sure it's perfect.
298
And I took that with me out of that experience.
299
And so then you go to Stanford to the GSB.
300
Went to the GSB, lovely.
301, a lot of Stanford Business School graduates at the time of my life, it was certainly not overly taxing.
302
I met a lot of people who become my lifelong friends.
303
And these are people who you work with, invest with, sit on boards with, are friends with, raise kids with.
304
Of the things you get out of an education, probably the most important was a core group of people that you end up spending the next 30 years with.
305
And that was fantastic.
306
I also got the opportunity to work as a casewriter.
307
I call it my third year of business school.
308
So yeah, talk about how you ended up doing the casewriting thing what that job entailed and maybe when did you first hear about what the heck a search fund was because kevin when you and i were in business school 1992 i think there had been five of them raised to that point Yeah, there weren't a lot at that point.
309
It was certainly Jim Southern, David Dodson, a couple of others.
310
Well, the search fund was in the background a little bit during our two years of business school.
311
I hadn't really focused on it a lot.
312
When you went to be a casewriter, did then you wanted to search?
313
Absolutely not.
314
I was more in the camp of I wanted to start a company.
315
So I wrote about this in my business school application, the desire to be an entrepreneur.
316
Certainly saw my father working in the store during summers while I was at university at McGill.
317
Basically, I was my own boss.
318
I was teaching soccer schools or soccer clinics throughout Prince Edward Island, the opportunity to be my own boss.
319
And I even started McGill Classmates, a small consulting firm during one of the summers.
320
So this idea of starting a company, being an entrepreneur, it goes back to the beginning.
321
And so when I was in my second year of business school, along with a handful of other classmates, we'd get together maybe Monday, Tuesday, every week, and we'd bat ideas back and forth, maybe brainstorming, trying to come up with some company that individually or as a group could start.
322
And I struggled at finding the right idea, what would make sense.
323
Interestingly, this is in 91, 92.
324
Had we been coming out of business school maybe five or six years later, at the dawn of the internet where eyeballs were everything, I'm glad we didn't because I think any one of our dumb ideas then could have gotten funded because they all ultimately got funded five or six years later.
325
I took the job as a casewriter, well, because I had no other offers.
326
I may have interviewed for one consulting firm, maybe one or two other types of jobs, but I didn't get the offers.
327
And then it was getting late in the year, and my then-girlfriend suggested I apply for this casewriting job.
328
Spoiler alert, our story arc is about to intersect with Irv Grossbeck.
329
The job was to be a casewriter for three professors, Irv Grosbeck, Jim Collins, the author of Built the Last and Good to Great, and Bill Azir, another wonderful professor and friend who's passed away and was a great influence in my life.
330
And they had interviewed a number of candidates.
331
They had offers out to two of those candidates for one position.
332
And those two candidates were holding out for better offers elsewhere.
333
I came in on a Friday afternoon.
334
I interviewed with all three of them.
335
They made me an offer, I think, that night, and I accepted before the other two could accept.
336
So at least I had my job.
337
I had my stable $40,000 a year job.
338
I didn't really know what I was getting into.
339
Well, it was more of a stopgap.
340
While I was doing my work, I could think of ideas to start a business.
341
And it was about that time, because I knew Irv had really been the godfather of the search fund or the mastermind behind it, that I started thinking about the search fund as a plan B, if I couldn't find a company to buy.
342
Fascinating.
343
So what point did you make the decision to go down that path?
344
How did those two things merge together?
345
Yeah, about halfway through my year as a casewriter.
346
I used to say it was the best job I ever had.
347
Running Assurance,.
348
a little bit better, but it was fantastic.
349
I got to work with, on average, an hour a day with Irv or Jim or Bill and learning about businesses and management and leadership.
350
And it was an intensive course or almost an intensive third year of MBA, which was better than the other two combined.
351
Obviously gave me some time to think about starting a business and gave me some time to reflect on that.
352
I still wasn't making much progress on that front.
353
And about halfway through, I decided it was time to pivot to plan B, which was doing a search fund.
354
And I thought, oh, gosh, it's not going to be as good because I want it to be my company.
355
I wanted this to have my fingerprints all over it from the start.
356
What I know now, but didn't realize then was when you buy a company through a search fund, yeah, your fingerprints are going to be all over it from the start.
357
If not from day one, certainly within a couple of months, you are the person that the culture is going to be built around.
358
So the fear I had about not being able to get that out of the search fund was not founded.
359
You decide to do it.
360
You go down the path.
361
You raise the capital, right?
362
Non-trivial in that era, still a novelty.
363
I think I raised a little over $200,000 in eight or nine or ten increments, started looking in the healthcare industry.
364
Jim Ellis took over as casewriter about the time I raised the fund.
365
And so he was officing at Stanford.
366
He was your successor.
367
Who was my successor as a casewriter and then my eventual partner here at Road Rescue?
368
While Jim moved into my office, I didn't move very far.
369
I just found an empty office and started my search out of that empty office.
370
I didn't really tell anybody.
371
I felt it was,, just keep my head down and nobody will figure it out.
372
Eventually, somebody figured it out and they kicked me out after about six months.
373
But it was important because I got a chance to spend time with Jim every day.
374
I was helping him with getting up to speed on casewriting.
375
Jim saw what I was doing.
376
It eventually led to a partnership between Jim and I.
377
Near the end of his year of writing cases was about the time that I had surfaced two potential transactions and Jim and I talked about them.
378
We decided we're going to do this together in that I would pursue one transaction, he would pursue the other.
379
And if one fell apart, that person would come back to the other transaction.
380
Or if we both ended up buying these companies, then we share some equity in each one of those.
381
That was the idea.
382
And he raised his fund at that point.
383
No, he didn't raise the search fund.
384
We leveraged my search fund.
385
We started doing diligence on each of the companies.
386
Mine was a small HMO based in Miami that focused on the Cuban community there.
387
And Jim had Road Rescue, a small motor club or roadside assistance company based in Houston.
388
And we did diligence on each.
389
Just as Jim was about to start raising money for the acquisition of Road Rescue, my target fell through.
390
It wasn't that the seller had misgivings.
391
The reason it fell through was I went to Miami with one of my investors, Bill Egan.
392
We spent a half a day with the seller, and then we went out to Joe's Stone Crabs in Miami.
393
And Bill was very impressed with the seller.
394
So much so that later that evening, when he and I conferred together about the transaction, Bill's opinion immediately was: now let's run away from this deal.
395
This guy is super talented.
396
He knows this space really well.
397
He knows the community.
398
He has been part of it for a long time.
399
If he's leaving, I don't want to be stepping into his shoes.
400
There's not necessarily something amiss, but you'll never live up to that.
401
It's going to be too difficult.
402
So we walked away from that.
403
And I think the next day, Jim and I met up just right before he was about to start fundraising.
404
We met up at a Chinese restaurant in Menlo Park.
405
And before appetizers hit the table, we came together, resolved who got what equity, which is 50-50, and that we were going to be leaving the next day to start fundraising together.
406
It was instantaneous.
407
And when you say fundraising, do you mean for the transaction?
408
For the road rescue transaction.
409
We were looking for, I think, purchase prices around eight, eight and a half million dollars.
410
And we generated that with $2 million in equity, two million in subordinated debt, all from investors, and then some senior debt on top of that.
411
That was an interesting experience going out to raise money for road rescue.
412
Talk about what that was.
413
It was a little different than search fund deals prior to that point.
414
I think we were sold out in 24 hours.
415
It was almost instantaneous.
416
Jim and I, we knew it was a potentially good transaction and good company, but we didn't have a lot of experience looking at companies.
417
I don't think we realized how good it was.
418
This, while small, yes, was showing meteoric growth, had recurring revenue, was profitable, low capital intensity, and simple operations.
419
It's you hit the jackpot.
420
And our investors got that right away.
421
They took as much as they could.
422 I said, I think we sold out in less than 24 hours, and we had to end up carving people back.
423
And importantly, we and other investors wanted Irv to be part of that transaction.
424
He was not in the search.
425
So we went to all our investors who had the right and all were very much willing to pair back their ownership stake to allow Irv to come in.
426
Because Irv was not only going to come in as an investor, he was going to sit on our board.
427
And here we are 28 years later, and Irv is still our stalwart on the Azurian board.
428
Some quick data on road rescue and that transaction.
429
So an important point is you guys bought all of that.
430
The multiple that you paid was, it was four and a half times trailing EBITDA for a business that had grown 90% in the prior year revenue.
431
Pausing on that, that's extraordinary.
432
And if you took the year before that, it didn't grow as fast.
433
You grew at 33%.
434
So you average those two.
435
That's 65% growth, pretty conservatively.
436
And you paid less than five times EBITDA for it.
437
We use this metric now in the world of search power ratio as a way of evaluating transactions.
438
The organic revenue growth rate divided by the EBITDA multiple.
439
And a typical private equity deal would have a metric of less than one times, 0.75.
440
And a good search fund deal would be a lot better than that.
441
It would be two to three times, which is a lot.
442
You and Jim were 15X, literally the highest power ratio in history.
443
So it is not surprising that it got that response from investors.
444
We did a lot of things right over time, but clearly we were really lucky.
445, to find this company that was leveraging growth in the wireless industry because they sold their product through wireless carriers.
446
And it was, I think there may have been at the time in 1995, maybe 10 million wireless subscribers in the U.S., which was going to go to 300 million.
447
That was really lucky.
448
The dynamics of play were important and difficult to, I think, replicate.
449
The CEO of the company had a small stake in it, and his father owned the majority of it.
450
So he's basically living under the thumb of his father.
451
And he had been running it for a few years, not too, too long, but was ready to stop working for his dad.
452
And so this was a big payday for him personally.
453
It would have been a few million to him, several more million to his father.
454
But in their world, that was a grand slam home run.
455
And we caught them at absolutely the right time.
456
Clearly, no auction involved, no deep process.
457, just to give some math on that, so the trailing revenue was $5.9 million.
458
Trailing EBITDA was $1.5 million.
459
You guys put out a deck where you projected what the next five years would be.
460
The deck called for 15 million of revenue by the year 2000, five years out.
461
So that's 17% growth and 3.7 million of EBITDA.
462
You assumed a little bit of multiple expansion, a crazy assumption.
463
You said you'd get to 5.8 times EBITDA.
464
All that got a 37% IR.
465
We may have been a little aggressive.
466
Okay, so 17% revenue growth was the core assumption there.
467
So you bought the company.
468
We bought it, yeah.
469
The actual process had its twists and turns, Will.
470
Probably the most interesting part of getting the transaction done was for two months, Jim and I sat in the office next to the seller, working with him, waiting to get the largest contract, GTE Wireless, renewed, because we weren't going to sign a contract unless that contract got renewed.
471
So we were very earnest and very cheap.
472
We shared a hotel room at the Embassy Suites.
473
It was super entertaining how I say, Jim, just give me 10 minutes to fall asleep first because you snore heck.
474
But we would get up the night every day.
475
It was Groundhog Day.
476
We try to help the seller prepare for his negotiations.
477
And I do believe proper preparation for important events, whether it's a contract renewal, whether it's a difficult conversation, is so critical.
478
And Jim and I may have gone overkill in this one.
479
We wrote a tome.
480
It was, here's the main contract terms.
481
Here's your position, Ray, seller's name.
482
And then here's what we expect GTE will say.
483
This should be your response.
484
It was a back and forth.
485
And it was probably 60 pages.
486
And we handed it up to Ray, asked him to review it in preparation for his contract.
487
We would rev it with him.
488
And it was probably overkill, but it was important to us.
489
We needed to get that contract signed to get the deal closed.
490
And it happened.
491
And sure enough, two months later, July of 1995, we got the deal closed.
492
Very cool.
493
One last thing to mention: he's been back through the materials, obviously, preparing to talk with you on all this stuff.
494
And the PPM you guys wrote for the deal, I think it goes straight to the IRV training as casewriters.
495
It's just excellent.
496, I would still recommend that as a model for people going down this path to look at.
497
It applies also to the early board decks, which were also very crisp.
498
Maybe talk about you buy the company, you relocate.
499
You and Jim do.
500
We moved to Houston, Texas.
501
Overnight, you go from Stanford MBAs to CEOs.
502
Talk a little bit about the first hundred days in the new role.
503
It was eye-opening to say the least.
504
Spending those two months sitting next to Ray, we got a chance to feel the sense of the organization, got to know the people.
505
So it wasn't quite as hard-cut, but now we're in charge.
506
There was some element of, what do you do?
507
What do you do now?
508
And we were really lucky, Will.
509
We had this amazing board of directors that honestly, I still marvel at how talented a board we're able to pull together for such a small company and for Jim and I.
510
You had Irv, and you had Joel Peterson, Bob Oster, Bill Egan, and David Dodson.
511
Four of them were operators, Bill Manley, an investor, but all with tremendous experience and were there willing to support us and give us advice at every turn.
512
More of an advisory board versus a governance board.
513
And so we had them to call on, which was helpful.
514
And yeah, I recall the first few months were a lot of asking questions, a lot of just observing what do you do, trying to understand the business.
515
That was number one.
516
And really getting to know the managers.
517
We importantly, I thought, we wanted to follow the money.
518
How does this really work?
519
Are people really paying us?
520
Are we really sending up checks?
521
So we would literally sign every check.
522
And because our business was roadside assistance, where we would send a tow truck in some town out to support or help one of our customers, they would send us an invoice and we would pay thousands of $50 checks to know.
523
We'd have to sign them.
524
You guys signed all the checks, thousands of checks.
525
How long did you guys do that for?
526
We probably did that for six months.
527
And then we handed that off to our new CFO who we hired a little bit later.
528
Jim and I were both happy to do it just so we understood the business.
529
As we got to know the managers, we learned in business school it's good to delegate.
530
We attempted to do so.
531
We quickly found that that didn't work very well.
532
So we were trying to manage my objectives, set up objectives and scorecard and we'll measure against it over time.
533
Yeah, that didn't work.
534
What the team that the seller built was used to was executing orders.
535
Seller would tell the specific leaders what to do and they would go do it.
536
But once they were done, that was it.
537
They didn't know what to do then.
538
So the idea of setting goals, empowering them to achieve those goals and having scorecards and managed them along the way, that quickly led us to realizing that the team that was there was not going to be the team that was going to be with us.
539
Certainly not the medium term and not the near term as well.
540
I think within a year, most of the team, if not all of the team, was entirely replaced.
541
What do you remember about the first year?
542
Jim and I, we saw this engine that was growing rapidly.
543
And we had this sense that, okay, land grant may be not exactly the right term, but it was a sense of once we got in and realized, oh, this is big and growing, we knew that we wanted to spend most of our time on the revenue side.
544
So Jim and I, to the extent we have 200% of our time, 100 each, we probably allocated about 150% of the 200 to revenue growth.
545
And Jim was entirely on either landing new accounts or managing our existing clients to drive more subscribers through their customer base.
546
And I was about 50% on that working with existing clients and 50% on operations, which meant that we knew by co-mission, which is the right way to do it, that we were taking a risk on the operations side.
547
So was the call center open?
548
Were calls being taken?
549
Were customers happy?
550
Were they being supported and aided on the side of the road appropriately or not?
551
And we were counting on the people we had in place to manage those to ensure that that happened.
552
Now, one of the things we did do to make sure that the operations were overrunning, Jim and I would set our alarm clocks in the middle of the night.
553
So I would set it for one and five.
554
Jim would set it for three and seven a.m.
555
And we would wake up and literally just, just while still in bed, call the 800 number, make sure somebody picked it up.
556
Because at that time, while we were 24-7, well, 24-7 meant three people in a couple of cubicles in a small room in Houston, Texas.
557
It wasn't much of a fail-safe or a plan B there.
558
And occasionally stuff would happen.
559 one time, somebody threw a brick through the window at our call center, and police got called.
560
And so the call center was down.
561
So Jim and I rushed down in the middle of the night.
562
And sure enough,, police presence in Houston in the mid-90s was incredible.
563
So we were there in probably five minutes.
564
The police had the place surrounded in probably two or three minutes.
565
And everything was cleared out.
566
It was fine, but our call center was down for an hour or two.
567
Put us in that room.
568, what was it being in that first office in Houston?
569
Yeah, Jim and I, we'd have our offices adjacent next to one another.
570
Our assistant, Tanya, was out in the other room.
571
We had to make sure that she didn't bring her weapon, her Glock 9, into the office.
572
We asked her to keep that outside, which, by the way, when we ultimately had to terminate Tanya, Jim and I rocked, paper, scissored in terms of who was going to fire her.
573
Fortunately, I won and Jim had to do it.
574
It was exhilarating.
575
It was really fun working with a partner.
576
We interacted continuously.
577
We probably didn't even need the wall between us.
578
I think we effectively separated our responsibilities.
579
I think that's important.
580
But we were always looking to the other for advice.
581
Hey, I'm thinking about doing this.
582
What do you think?
583
Can I get your input on this?
584
There's a lot of energy in that and excitement.
585
And well, I got to make the decision in the areas of my responsibility.
586
And the same for Jim.
587
We wanted the other to be involved and engage with it.
588
Strategic matters, Jim and I would come together, make the decision together.
589
And there may have been three instances in our whole time together where we disagreed.
590
And then we're, okay, we've got two co-CEOs.
591
How do we handle that?
592
Well, we would pick a board member.
593
It was usually Irv.
594
And Jim and I would either eat face-to-face or on the phone with Irv.
595
And we were pretty good about this.
596
I would defend Jim's position, and Jim would defend my position.
597
And we didn't want Irv to know who felt what.
598
And inevitably, in every case, instead of picking A or B, Irv had a third alternative that was so much better.
599
It was fun.
600
Changing out the team was that's challenging, right?
601, we were early on in our first conversations with people of how to terminate them, performance manage them.
602
And a lot of the conversations that Irv teaches at Stanford and managing growing enterprises or conversations in management, we were living it real time.
603
I remember Jim and I had made the decision to terminate one of our regional managers.
604
And Jim called him up and said, Hey, we're coming to San Antonio tomorrow and to have a conversation.
605
And it had been three or four months and we'd never been there.
606
And so he's, okay, I will see you tomorrow.
607
And we hung up the phone and he called back maybe an hour later.
608
He said, so my wife and I were planning on looking at boats later today and thinking about buying one.
609
Should I maybe delay that until after our conversation?
610
Jim had to respond.
611
Yeah, why don't you hold off on that?
612
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
613
We were learning our way through it of how to have these conversations.
614
He clearly knew there's so much we did wrong there.
615
Obviously, he was sitting in place for months, probably realizing he wasn't doing a good job, and we were letting that drag out.
616
And instead of just showing up and having the conversation, we had this pre-conversation, which led to an effective termination without a termination.
617
So he had to wait for 24 hours to hear it.
618
We were making our mistakes, and yet the company was still growing.
619
So, one of the geniuses of the search fund is: if you buy a company that is growing, early stable and profitable, it can withstand the mistakes the young new entrepreneurs will inevitably make.
620
And probably the biggest one, the biggest mistake we made, Will, was when we saw that wireless was growing, we thought we were in the roadside assistance business.
621
So, we defined ourselves as a roadside assistance company.
622
And this had meaningful impact to what we did and how we resourced and where we allocated our time.
623
And so, probably in it, I don't know, six months, a year.
624
And we decide: look, we've got this great channel of distribution, wireless.
625
Well, there are probably other channels of distribution.
626
Why not sell roadside assistance to automotive manufacturers, to insurance companies, credit card companies?
627
We know you can access roadside assistance directly through those channels as well.
628
And so, Jim and I built a sales force and we started going after,, maybe half a dozen people with a leader and started going after those channels of distribution.
629
So, it took us about a year or so to realize that this was a mistake.
630
Because we were effective at getting in to talk to the companies, and even we were able to bid on some RFPs in General Motors article vividly.
631
But the big difference between these other channels of distribution and the wireless channel was it was a cost center.
632
Roadside Assistance was a cost center.
633
It was something that these channels gave away for free and they would try to squeeze on the providers so that they would minimize the cost of that loyalty benefit that they were offering.
634
Whereas for roadside assistance, the wireless carriers marked it up and made a healthy profit.
635
And so they were comfortable growing that and we could make money at that.
636
Whereas with the other new channels of distribution, it was very low margin business.
637
We finally figured it out.
638
Took us a while and then we backtracked.
639
And to our credit, we made some hard decisions and we let go of that entire team.
640
This is year two.
641
This is probably, yeah, year two, year three, maybe 97, 98.
642
And we decide, hold on, while we were undertaking all this folly over here with new distribution channels, the core was still growing, roadside assistance to the wireless industry.
643
And we thought, let's continue to lean into that.
644
So this is our first lesson on the concept of focusing on the core, getting more juice out of the core business.
645
And we did refocus on the core and started looking at other products and services we can sell into wireless.
646
You guys put out a paper around that time.
647
If you look at the growth characteristics of that core market, they're just extraordinary, right?
648, you can increase your penetration of existing customers.
649
You can sell new accounts.
650
And then, meanwhile, the overall market is growing.
651
People are signing up for more phones.
652
When you started, cellular penetration in the U.S.
653
was 32%.
654
I think it might have been even lower than that, Will.
655
I think by 2000, it was 30%.
656
So we got the ride even a little bit earlier than that.
657
When did you and Jim decide to move back to the Bay Area?
658
I think we moved back a year from the day of starting.
659
So we started in July 95, we moved back in July 96.
660
And Jim and I hadn't really contemplated it.
661
The topic was brought up by Irv.
662
So Irv was close to the company, still is, but he saw that we were traveling a lot.
663
Jim in particular was traveling for client meetings and new business development.
664
I was on the road as well for client meetings and for going out to our different offices.
665
And he felt we would be happier and it would be more long-term sustainable for us as leaders to re-locate back into the Bay Area where we wanted to be and where both our spouses had jobs.
666
Because while we were traveling, so are our spouses.
667, they were traveling, they're both consultants and traveling four days a week.
668
So he saw the stress it was putting on the system and thought that even though it would be potentially better for us to be located in Houston, that it was going to be long-term, more sustainable.
669
Trust to leave, and we were, it didn't take him mentioning it twice for us to get out of there.
670
We were happy to leave in the first two, three, four years.
671
I would describe it, having read through those board decks recently, I would describe it as what my daughter would call a hot mess.
672
So there's a consistent pattern of you guys growing,, above budget.
673
So subscriber and revenue count, which is what Straz you said.
674
That was it, that was what you were focused on.
675
That was the driver of revenue.
676
That was exceeding plan.
677
And SGNA would be a little bit over, and EBTA would be a little bit short.
678
There's a lot of moving parts going on.
679
The key point in that is never once across that period of time did the company grow subscribers less than 50% a year.
680
And that is pure organic all roadside assistance, right?
681
And so, in the middle of all of that comes a bid, right?
682
So, it's an interesting moment before all this where CUC, I think it was, comes in and they bid.
683
This is 1997, two years in, they bid 60 million bucks, which is 15 times MOIC.
684
How did you and Jim, the board, process that?
685
That would still, by the way, be a top 5% outcome.
686
Can I address your comment about us being a hot mess at that period of time?
687
Masses a little strong.
688
Oh, no, no, no.
689
You're right.
690
You're right.
691
This was coincidental.
692
Group doesn't need to say a lot to make a point.
693
One of his great strengths.
694
So, in that time period, the first two years, and he sees what's going on.
695
He reads the decks.
696
He sees us overperforming on revenue and underperforming on margin.
697
And he pauses during the board meeting and says something to the effect of, So, Jim and Kevin, do I have this right?
698
Feels you're overperforming on all the uncontrollable items and underperforming on all the controllable items.
699
I don't think there's any response needed for that.
700
Got it.
701
Message received.
702
That will never be forgotten and will be retold again and again.
703
Going back to CUC, we get an offer from CUC, who were high fires at that time.
704
I don't think they had merged with HFS at that point in time, but this was before the principals of CUC all went to jail.
705
It was incredible.
706
It was 15 times it would have been in two years.
707
And we were proud as a way to describe it.
708
It's, wow, this is real.
709
Somebody will pay a lot of money for this.
710
It was more of a LOI offering.
711
They hadn't gone into diligence.
712
And so we don't know if they really would have paid up.
713
But the conversation at the board meeting was absolutely enlightening.
714
Jim and I were just spectators.
715
We were listening.
716
We presented the offer to people they were new.
717
And to hear the various opinions expressed on how to look at this and evaluate it was, I felt I was in a classroom and learning and absorbing all this great experience.
718
One of our board members has a long history and was very, very successful at transactions.
719, he was a proponent of selling.
720
He was, look, you just can't beat it.
721
It's 15 times your money in two years.
722
You put a big win, not just a small one, a big win on your resume.
723
You go out and you and Jim, you go at it again, and you go find another company, and you set the bar, and your reputation is established, and it'll be a win for the investors and everyone.
724
And that made a lot of sense to Jim and I.
725
And then one of our other board members, Irv, he had a different view.
726
He started with, How do you feel?
727
And he asked Jim and I some questions: How do you feel about the company?
728
How do you feel the prospects are for road rescue over the next five years?
729
Do you think it's going to grow?
730
Do you enjoy what you're doing?
731
And he made the case for if you have confidence in the runway ahead of you.
732
And at this time, we did.
733
While there were pockets of competition from AAA sprouting up, we did have confidence in the growth.
734
And it was tough not to, given how fast we were growing and how fast the wireless industry was growing.
735
Irv said, look, if you're confident and you enjoy what you're doing, then do you really want to sell now, pay half of what you get in taxes to Uncle Sam, and then you guys got to go out and find another.
736
And it's not easy to find the road rescues of the world.
737
They're few and far between.
738
That point of view ended up carrying the day.
739, Jim and I, of course, made the decision, but it gave us a chance to really evaluate how committed we were to this company and the industry.
740
And in a sense, we emotionally doubled down after that.
741
It's worth mentioning that Irv built his career as the co-CEO of one of the two best-run cable companies, a company called Continental Cable Vision, that he and his partner ran for 30 years.
742
So Irv had some direct experience with similar situations that informed his views as a board member, investor, and partner and friend.
743
I think both of them came at it from their experiences that they had.
744
Okay, well, so let's maybe talk about handset insurance.
745
My favorite topic.
746
Yeah, good topic.
747
How that evolved as a business for you guys and how you've got the MA hat back on there.
748
And just maybe talk a little bit about that Merrimack piece.
749
Once we decided we're going to focus on wireless, we looked at doubling down in that space.
750
So building out our client services team and sales team to sell into more wireless carriers.
751
But we also looked at other products that we could potentially sell through that same channel of distribution because it was such an amazing channel of distribution.
752
And at the time, if you went into any wireless handset store, you would see a couple of brochures on the desk when you were waiting to buy your handset or set up your wireless plan.
753
One was roadside assistance for $3 a month, and right next to it, everywhere, was cell phone insurance for $3 a month.
754
And so, of course, we'd be mystery shopping and training in these stores all the time.
755
So, you literally look at the pamphlet and read it.
756
I'm, hold on, cell phone insurance.
757
That seems to be more closely aligned with wireless than roadside assistance.
758
Hmm, I might want to be in that business.
759
And so, we would have never found cell phone insurance were we not in the business.
760
But because we were, we got to see it.
761
And outside in, it may seem a big move.
762
It's an entirely different product.
763
Why would you consider this as an acquisition?
764
But once you're in the industry, you realize that, in fact, both the person you pitch to at the wireless carrier is the same marketing manager.
765 it's a value-added services marketing manager within the wireless company.
766
The person you're selling to is the exact same person.
767
The financial orientation of the products were identical.
768
They were both insurance-esque.
769
So, a customer would pay $3 a month build on your cell phone bill.
770
And the risk of how many times somebody would break a phone or use the service was borne by us.
771
And operationally, they were very similar.
772
Somebody had a problem, they would call a call center.
773
We would either send a phone or send a tow truck.
774
They were almost identical businesses.
775
We got conviction pretty quickly.
776
We wanted to be in this business.
777
So, we pursued both a buy-and-build strategy.
778
We knew that our biggest client, GTE, was looking for a provider of cell phone insurance.
779
So, we started bidding on it because we had a seat at the table because of our relationship.
780
At the same time, we started talking to the three players in the industry that provided cell phone insurance.
781
So, there were three small players at the time: the company we bought, the Merrimack Group, Lockwine, and Signal.
782
And before that RFP concluded, we were able to move down the path with the Merrimack Group and close that transaction.
783
And that's what really launched us into the cell phone insurance industry.
784
Talk a little bit, if you don't mind, about that deal.
785
Had that come together.
786
It was based in Nashville.
787
Two partners who are former insurance agents with one of the big firms, I think Marshall McConnell, started it and they were in the insurance industry and saw others doing it, this niche and cell phone insurance.
788
Their growth profile looked not dissimilar to what Road Rescue did four or five years earlier.
789
So you've got this business that may have been dealing four or five million of revenue, a little over a million of EBITDA, but we're adding wireless subscribers hand over fist, much Roadside was.
790
So it's going back in time a little bit.
791
But they were insurance agents.
792
They had never run a business, scaled a business.
793
So they were running at the limit of their capacity and credibility.
794
We hit them at the right time.
795
They were ready to cash out, if you will.
796, it had a nice run.
797
They were agents for a while.
798
Now, this would give them plenty of money for retirement.
799
You approached them, right?
800
So given that this is a proprietary direct approach, proprietary, direct.
801
We approached all three and we tried to hold simultaneous conversations with all three.
802
This one progressed more quickly.
803
And so we focused on it.
804
I recall the transaction negotiations.
805
We were at the Union Station Hotel in downtown Nashville.
806
I remember we had two hotel rooms.
807
The four of us were negotiating in one.
808
And they came to us with their final offer.
809 the price is $8 million, I think it was, or something around there, and not a penny less.
810
And Jim and I looked at each other.
811
It's, oh, we're going to have to think about this.
812
And so we retired to our room and we had this little squishy basketball that we were playing with and we're throwing it back and forth.
813
And our first question is, how long do you think we have to hang out in here before it's okay to go back in and say yes?
814
We had experience with roadside assistance.
815
So we had some idea.
816
We knew that the acquisition of American Market Group could be a really good transaction, a la roadside assistance.
817
Turns out it was 10X that.
818
We didn't know that, but we knew it was going to be good.
819
But once we got inside and under the covers, you had to spend a few months in the organization.
820
You're, oh, hold on.
821
There's a lot more here than we thought.
822
How many minutes did you give them?
823
20 minutes.
824
20 minutes.
825
Okay.
826
That's the lesson.
827
20 minutes, no less than that.
828
Yeah, and we ended up buying, I think it was six times EBITDA.
829
It was growing so fast.
830
I think the multiple on a run rate basis was a lot lower than that.
831
So the numbers that we've got for that were just exactly what you said, Kevin.
832
So a little over 4 million of revenue, 1.2 of EBITDA, some growth of 60%, right?
833
So very similar to the growth rate at Road Rescue initially.
834
You guys paid on a run rate basis four and a half times EBITDA for that.
835
That doesn't even include the fact that some of it was paid over time, and you could probably discount that if you wanted to.
836
But it ended up at that time, about 18% of enterprise value.
837
That's an important point, the 18%.
838
Well, Jim and I had confidence.
839
Our board didn't have the same level of confidence.
840
So there's this element of when you're particularly when you're doing acquisitions, you never want to bet the farm.
841 you don't want this to be the acquisition doesn't go the way you think, then it takes the whole thing down.
842
My rule of thumb there is max 20-25% of enterprise value.
843
I will deviate from that by commission.
844
We're going to get to that, by the way, but yes, go ahead.
845
I remember one of our board members thought this was the stupidest idea in the world.
846
It's, who would buy insurance for your cell phones?
847
At the time, you may recall cell phones were free.
848
They were given away as part of your wireless plan if you signed up for a contract.
849
And he was, why would you do this?
850
This is stupid.
851
We had confidence we didn't know for sure, but we also knew because the roadside assistance business at that point was so much bigger that it wouldn't have killed us if things didn't go as we expected.
852
You financed it all with debt and cash off the balance sheet.
853
No equity required.
854
Correct.
855
Yeah, nothing required.
856
That's an important point that we haven't really touched on, which is the business, in addition to rapid growth, had exceptional economic characteristics, right?
857
So crazy high returns on tangible capital, well over 100% on that metric.
858
And simple way to think about that is for a dollar of EBITDA, typically at least half of it and often more turned into free cash flow for you guys.
859
All of that growth you could finance internally.
860
Yeah, with cash flow or debt.
861
Yeah.
862
We didn't have a ton of networking capital that was required to grow the business, not a lot of PPA.
863
We inherited that structure.
864
It was certainly wind in our sales, if you will.
865
Acquisition closes.
866
Talk a little bit maybe about the integration.
867
How quickly you guys brought that on stream, and then we'll talk a little bit about the capital allocation topic.
868
That was an exciting time.
869
We're no longer traveling to Houston, we're traveling to Nashville to get this up and running.
870
And there was a big aha within a month or two because essentially, round numbers, the customer paid $3 a month for this insurance, and you give 50 cents to the carrier as a billing collection fee.
871
And then $2.50 of that would go to basically the underwriter who managed everything.
872
And that $250, the Merrimack group only got 50 cents of it.
873
The other $2 went to the underwriter to pay for claims, to pay for the logistics of getting those phones to the customers, and to pay for profits that they would get.
874
Even though the 250 was managed by the Merrimack group.
875
Whoa, hold on.
876
We're managing it.
877
We know everything.
878
We know the economics of this.
879
We know the risk.
880
We understand the risk better than anybody else, better than the underwriters themselves, because we are, we see it real time.
881
And so the first move we make, which changed everything, was: no, no, we capture the 250 and that becomes our revenue, not the 50 cents.
882
We didn't know that before.
883
We brought in an insurance expert who basically quickly told us, no, no, no, you don't need the insurance company.
884
You can rent their licenses.
885
And so immediately, instead of them taking the risk and controlling all that, we took that on and we rented their insurance license for a few percentage points, maybe five at that point, and now is a lot less.
886
But that gave us control of everything.
887
And now we're, okay, yeah, game on.
888
Now we get the underwriting profits immediately because we'll take that out, but then it opens up the world for us to better manage the claims distribution process and ultimately the repair of those phones.
889
So step one is to get control of the entire premium and take over the underwriting profits.
890
Step two was become the logistics provider.
891
So instead of having a third-party FedEx or EPS and not just delivery, but manage the warehouses and all that, we created our own.
892
We started our own warehouse.
893
And this way we would ensure that the customer got served, if not the next day, the day after, which was an important customer service metric.
894
But we also were able to do that a lot less expensively than those third-party logistics providers.
895
And then finally, the final step of vertical integration will was the repair of cell phones.
896
So every time, probably a majority of the time a phone had a problem, it was damaged and not lost or stolen.
897
So there's still value in those phones.
898
And we started the process of getting those old devices back, refurbishing them, making them new.
899
We would always replace the plastics on the outside so you're never touching old stuff, but we reuse the internal parts.
900
And we can in turn save a lot of money in that process while getting the customer into the same handset that they had damaged originally.
901
So, those three steps led us to control the customer experience, keep the price down for consumers, and increase the profitability of the program for our carrier partners.
902
So, how long do you think it took, Kevin, to get to the point where you guys were fully in vertical integration mode?
903
That took about three or four years.
904
Step one took about a year.
905
Getting into the distribution business started about a year after we were in it, and that just scaled.
906
We were in it right away, but it was a room the size of a closet.
907
We gradually, over the next years, took more and more from the third party and created our own logistics center.
908
So, that took a little over a year.
909
And then, once we had the logistics center, we curved off the space and started repairing phones there.
910
It evolved over time, but really it took about three or four years to get fully into it.
911
And then we just perfected it.
912
We scaled it and perfected it.
913
And ultimately, we had operations in Hong Kong, we had operations in China.
914
Now, we've consolidated them all in the Philippines, a lot of our logistics and repair operation.
915
And again, the linchpin for all this is the Merrimack acquisition, $7.3 million first for Road Rescue got us in the game, and the Merrimack group was really the main engine.
916
While we stayed in the roadside assistance business, it was clear that hands-up protection was the engine after a couple of years.
917
We intentionally diverted resources from it, time and attention, but that became competitive quickly as well.
918
Probably around that 2007, 8 timeframe, the roadside assistance went away, but it's all been about self-funded insurance since 2001.
919
The headline for Assurion is phenomenal organic growth over time, but the selected MA activities have added just enormous value across the whole hold period, Merrimack being front and center in that, and one other we'll get to, but a very unique feature of the company's history over time.
920
There was one capital allocation event in those early years where in 1999, you guys have the cash generation you were talking about, Kevin, and you decide to do a share repurchase, something that's pretty unusual in private companies.
921
Can you talk a little bit about that early repurchase, how it came about?
922
If anything you remember about that, there's always this debate on whether you do a dividend or a share repurchase.
923
And ERV was instrumental in our learning on this dimension.
924
It was a big part of the Continental playbook over time.
925
It's almost always the right tool to use.
926
As long as you can value it fairly, it allows individual investors to make a decision.
927
Do you want liquidity or not at this price?
928
Are you a buyer, you're seller, you're a holder?
929
Versus a dividend, which is you're force-feeding somebody money that they may or may not want.
930
Sure, intuitively you think, oh, yes, give me a dividend.
931
That sounds great.
932
But as the recipient of that, what do I do with that?
933
Can I redeploy that in the same place?
934
Do I want to redeploy that?
935
That was our first introduction to balance sheet management, if you will, from IRV.
936
It was a good lesson.
937
The importance and the impact, although I'm not sure we fully appreciated at the time, of a share repurchase over a dividend.
938
Yeah, that's extremely well laid out.
939
Basically, this is the first step down the path for the company, right?
940
98, 99 is very early days, and you guys invest $12.5 million, all financed by debt, and buy in 10% of the company.
941
The IRR math on that transaction is rather good: 41% IRR over 22 years and an MOIC of 275x.
942
So just the power of doing that early, and it's very rare in private equity.
943
It almost basically never happens in private equity.
944
It's very rare even in search.
945
Kevin, we touched on this a little bit as we were talking about the share repurchase, but businesses generating all this cash.
946
Can you talk a little bit about use of leverage in the very early days and how you guys thought about that?
947
I think it was an important consideration and driver of returns, obviously.
948
And when we did the original road rescue deal, I'd say we used leveraged to the maximum extent possible.
949
So we went out and got a sufficient amount of as much senior debt as we could.
950
And in fact, the investor capital that we raised, we structured that partially as debt and partially as equity in order to drive the highest returns to shareholders.
951
You just look over the next couple of years as we came to the Merrimack deal, of course, using leverage, the lowest cost of capital out there.
952
We were going to use that at every turn, whether it was cash in the balance sheet or cash that we could generate from raising debt.
953
We always had that mindset from the start of responsibly using the lowest cost of capital that's available to us.
954
And debt was at times it was more available than less, but we had that as part of our ethos.
955
I think that interestingly, you saw our leverage ratios decline from the initial transaction and up until the Merrimack transaction.
956
And we just didn't have a use for that.
957
So you think of what's the highest and best use of that, and you'll reinvest that in the operations to the extent that you really believe in the return on investment that you're going to get from that.
958
And we were.
959
We were investing as much as we could.
960
Number two, it would be acquisitions.
961
And so there was nothing available to us.
962
And then number three, we were returning capital to shareholders, ideally in a share repurchase secondarily in the form of a dividend.
963
And in those early years, we didn't really think about the latter too much.
964
Obviously, we did that small transaction, returning 10% of capital through a share or purchase.
965
But we would really come back to leverage mainly, at least in those first years, at either an acquisition or in conjunction with an equity recap.
966
Happened to undertake and the first one of that was really 2001 when TA came onto the cap table.
967
Okay, TA is a good segue.
968
So let's talk in a minute about that transaction, the first material transaction for the company.
969
But before we do that, I just want to stop and give a snapshot of the business in the year 2000.
970
So just after the Merrimack deal closed in 99, you'll remember that the original PPM document, the base case, was $15 million of revenue and $3.7 million of EBITDA.
971
The year 2000 actual numbers for the company, which of course include Merrimack at this point in time, early days, was $135 million in revenue.
972
So it was a 63% compound annual growth rate since closing and $27 million in EBITDA, right, the 20% margin.
973
So that's pretty substantial value creation by any metric, along any measure.
974
The subscriber count grew about 8X over that period of time.
975
Right.
976
So that's now come to fruition in the business.
977
And you guys make a decision to explore a transaction, offer some liquidity to shareholders.
978
Can you talk a little bit about that?
979
We have seen mercurial growth and we were excited by it, but at the same time, we took it all in stride.
980
Maybe we were a little overconfident because with the Merrimack transaction,, things were a little more challenging.
981
We now had two companies.
982
Jim and I were stretched.
983
The management team wasn't as strong as we would have liked it.
984
And so there was some element of, I think, Jim and I just seen the risk here.
985
It was, hold on, this is great, but neither Jim nor I had taken anything out at this point.
986
And we were both interested in some financial security.
987
We decided, conferred with the board, we had conversations about whether we could buy in as many shares as we wanted to or as were desired with just debt.
988
And we thought we couldn't do that.
989
So we opened it up to an equity process.
990
And that generated some interest.
991
But in particular, the highest bidder was TA Associates.
992
And while investors were interested in liquidity, I think it was really Jim and I driving it, the need for financial security.
993
And the board, they thought that was a good idea.
994, having management hold on two tights, never a good idea.
995
And they understood that from the early days.
996
So just allowing us to let some air out of the balloon and give us some financial security, they thought we agreed would help us be better managers.
997
The TA transaction was once again a situation where Jim and I were back in the classroom.
998
He and I were nominally negotiating it.
999
We were the frontman, but really there were people behind each of us pulling the strings.
1000
On our side, it was really Bill Egan and Irv Krozbeck who were negotiating through us with TA.
1001
So Irv, TA had been an investor in Irv's company.
1002
Bill had been a partner with the folks at TA.
1003
So they all knew each other very well.
1004
And there was, I'm sure, there were baggage from each other past that were being handled through surrogates that were Jim and I.
1005
And on the other side, Jim and I were dealing with Jeff Chambers and Richard Towler were wonderful, but they weren't really in the control speed either.
1006
It was Kevin Landry and Andrews Clain behind them.
1007
So it was an interesting negotiation.
1008
But at the end of the day, we had the what I call the IRV factor in the sense of when we said no to something, they knew it wasn't us and they weren't really negotiating with us.
1009
They knew it was coming from Irv.
1010
And we understand what that means.
1011
And no meant no.
1012
And no meant no.
1013
And they came in with a term sheet that had a high price, but it had a number of conditions to include they wanted control over major operating decisions to include the budget and key hires.
1014
They want to take the company public, registration rights, and they wanted a preference and they wanted a couple of other items.
1015
And without getting into too much detail, basically we came back at the advice of Irv and Bill and just said no to all of them.
1016
The insight for them, which again, Jim and I in the classroom being the students, was TA is in the business of investing in great companies.
1017
If we have confidence in the company and we don't need the capital because it's all secondary, then we've got all the power.
1018
And while we ultimately acceded to some minor rights to TA, at the end of the day, they basically come in with the same security.
1019
It's all common, and I think happily so in the end.
1020
And honestly, I think if you looked at the history of TA Associates, that transaction not being preferred is a wild outlier thanks to the quality of the business.
1021
It was absolutely common to both be preferred and to have a coupon, and they got neither of those.
1022
Jeff Chambers ended up joining the board and was a wonderful fan.
1023
I think the board dynamics are always incredibly important.
1024
And he got a chance to shine early on because soon after TA investing, we missed our numbers.
1025
And I think the next two quarters, it was really the first time we've missed our numbers.
1026
And Jeff was as cool as a cucumber.
1027
He may have been sweating behind the scenes, but he was consistent and supportive.
1028
And we made our way through it.
1029
Everything turned out fine for TA, but he was tested early on, that's for sure.
1030
And Jeff is great.
1031
Quick math on that transaction was they paid a valuation of $225 million.
1032
They bought $60 million worth of stock at that.
1033
So they ended up owning a little bit over 25% of the company, all of it secondary, as you said, Kevin.
1034
Significantly, none of it preferred.
1035
And the IRR for selling shareholders from the original search group over five and a half years was a multiple of invested capital of 41 times and an IRR of 102%.
1036
So that's a reasonable start.
1037
And we'll return to get into what followed from that start, but I think that's a good place to cut things.
1038
So thanks for your time, Kevin.
1039
Perfect.
1040
Kevin, in our last conversation, we talked about the first five years of Assurion's history from the acquisition of Road Rescue in 1995 to TA coming in as a director in very early 2001.
1041
Put some numbers around that.
1042
You started with $8.5 million of revenue and $1.2 million in EBITDA coming entirely from the roadside assistance business.
1043
In 2000, you had $78 million in revenue and $25 million in EBITDA with around 35% of that coming from handset insurance.
1044
Okay, so we're now officially in the TA era, early 2001.
1045
And it just seems as though that early 01-02 era represents a step-function change for the company.
1046
A lot of transformation then.
1047
And maybe a place to start, Kevin, if you don't mind, is with the actual renaming of the company.
1048
How did all that come about?
1049
The story of our names is an amusing one, if anything.
1050
When we bought the company in 1995, we bought Road Rescue Inc.
1051
We were known as, in the marketplace, Mr.
1052
Rescue, but it was Road Rescue Inc.
1053
When we bought the Merrimack group, we merged the two companies together.
1054
It was one holding company, and we came up with the very creative name, Road Rescue Merrimack.
1055
It clearly didn't roll off the tongue.
1056
It was a pretty straightforward process.
1057
Well, we realized that that was not a long-term name.
1058
It's entirely unrelated to TA investment, but we did need to come up with a name that represented who we are and who we wanted to be.
1059
And we hired a marketing firm and they helped us lead us through a process.
1060
Assurian was the winner of that process.
1061
There were a handful of others that were similar sounding, but the idea of Assurance to Protect resonated with us.
1062
And that was also a time when URLs were difficult to find.
1063
So we were pretty happy to land on a Shurion and it sucked and we've been excited to continue with that name ever since.
1064
Let's maybe talk a little bit about the senior management team and the overhaul there.
1065
Maybe go back, touch on Gerald, and we can go forward from there.
1066
The hiring of Gerald Risk was a seminal moment for me personally.
1067
It was where I truly found or saw the power of hiring a 10X person.
1068
Our previous CFO was a talented CFO who filled the role at the time.
1069
But when we transitioned him out and Gerald into that spot, Gerald didn't come from a CFO background, but you could tell he had the same hunger that Jim and I had.
1070
I want to say it's rare, this sense of I just want to win.
1071
Today, I call them drivers and stewards.
1072, you want drivers to just accelerate the business, take it further.
1073
You don't have to push them.
1074
These people are excited to win and to grow and succeed.
1075
And others are content to manage and report and be custodians and trustees, if you will.
1076
When you interview somebody and you see it in their past, these examples of overachievement, of attaining high levels in whatever they do, the sense of wanting to win.
1077
And we saw that in Gerald.
1078
And the impact to the organization was immediate and surprising because he was our first big hire.
1079
He not only took on finance and handled that almost instantaneously.
1080
He took on parts of operations.
1081
He took on information technology at the time.
1082
And he took us to places from a strategic perspective that we probably wouldn't have gone otherwise because Jim and I really saw him as a true partner as we moved on from road tight assistance into hands-up protection.
1083
It was a big wow moment for us.
1084
Along the same lines of importance of 10X type managers was the hiring of Brett.
1085
Jim wanted to wind down his day-to-day activity within Assurion and he was moving on to teaching at Stanford.
1086
And Jim and I went out to look for a chief operating officer, someone essentially who would report to me who'd help get the trains running on time.
1087
I think before that, Jim and I, we were good doers.
1088
We knew what to do.
1089
We were pretty competent.
1090
We were good salespeople.
1091
We could get the basics done, but we weren't necessarily skilled at managing, driving, inspiring a team.
1092
And we went out looking for someone who had done that before because we were growing and scaling quite rapidly.
1093
Finding Brett was, it was lucky that we found him.
1094
We were introduced to a mutual friend.
1095
He and I and Jim hit it off right away.
1096
And we realized, given his experience at West Point, running a couple of other companies in the past, that he had the skills we wanted and needed to grow our business.
1097
Where did he come from?
1098
Who was the referral?
1099
And what were a couple of things he did before you ran across him?
1100
He was introduced to us by Bill Lazir.
1101
Bill was a professor at Stanford.
1102
He's one of the three people I worked for as a case writer when I finished my MBA there and a dear friend.
1103
Turns out he and Brett were close.
1104
They had a relationship.
1105
I think it was through his son-in-law.
1106
Brett had graduated from Stanford a few years before me.
1107
And we reached out to our investor base, our network, looking for people who filled this profile.
1108
Bill connected us and we hit it off right away.
1109
Brett's background was West Point.
1110
He did five years after West Point in the Army.
1111
He did not finish top of his class.
1112
He finished number two at West Point.
1113
A point which I continually give him a hard time about.
1114
He had a couple of really senior leadership positions.
1115
I think he was the chief operating officer at Risk Management Solutions.
1116
And then he was a CEO of another small software startup that had just recently been acquired by Excite at Home, if you remember that company from the Wayback Machine.
1117
We just caught each other at the right time and he came on board.
1118
We were looking, as I said, for a COO.
1119
We were never going to get him with that title.
1120
So Jim and I were super flexible on titles and he took the CEO title.
1121
I had already had the chairman title.
1122
And that was really the beginning of another amazing partnership of mine.
1123
Was he a board member from the outset?
1124
Yes.
1125
We brought him on to the board right away.
1126
What he brought right away were leadership skills in terms of managing a team that Jim and I, but particularly I got a chance to learn from over the next several years.
1127
He and I were partners and we would talk every day, multiple times a day, much Jim and I had.
1128
And we were giving each other advice.
1129
It was really a great opportunity for me to watch him, to learn from him, and eventually to improve myself along the way.
1130
But think about where he was really strong.
1131
It was inspiring leading a team.
1132
It was focus on the customer, really understood what the customer experience was and drove that through the entire organization.
1133
And then one of his superpowers is relationship management.
1134
Beyond being just a great leader, he is one of the best client relationship management people on the planet.
1135
And there's some great stories about how he built some relationships over time, which are true and amusing.
1136, first of all, it's amazing if you think about it, you going from one super close, productive partnership with Jim almost seamlessly overnight to one with Brett.
1137
Talk a little bit about some of the mechanics of that.
1138
What time did you guys get started?
1139
It is true.
1140, I lucked.
1141
I feel very lucky to have had a handful of great partnerships over the years.
1142
It's so much more fun to do it with somebody.
1143
And I think about the relationship that Jim and I had, the relationship Brett and I have, two things that stand out the most about each of those that were common.
1144
We talked all the time.
1145
We reached out to one another all the time.
1146
The second thing was we pulled the others in.
1147
So with Jim or myself or Brett and myself, we were always looking to the other for advice, for help, as opposed to pushing the other person away and saying, hey, this is my sandbox.
1148
You stay out type thing.
1149
But Brett took his military training and applied it to Assurion.
1150
So I thought I was an early riser and getting going at seven in the morning.
1151
And sure enough, nope.
1152
I think Brett started as early, probably get up at 4, 4:30 every morning.
1153
I was in the office by five.
1154
And that,, it sets a tone.
1155
People see that.
1156
They see somebody getting in early, working hard, dedicating their time to this adventure we were on.
1157
And it's infectious.
1158
He did it.
1159
And so I was there too.
1160
That permeated through the management team.
1161
And can you talk a little bit about culture as you guys are building it and hiring and talent management as you and Brett and team began to build off of that together as a partnership?
1162
It certainly started with Jim and I and Gerald and then continued with Brett and I and Gerald.
1163
The term we use to define the culture at Ashurian is divine discontent.
1164
And it's a term that was coined by David Kirk, a former McKinsey consultant, but before that, he was the captain of the New Zealand All Blacks World Champion Rugby Team.
1165
He wrote this paper on high-performing teams and he described his experience with the All Blacks.
1166
And Gerald read it, this article, and he brought it into my office.
1167
I'll never forget.
1168
He said, this may not be who we are today, but it's who we certainly aspire to be.
1169
What that means, divine discontent, is this idea that you've got a team of people who are incredibly talented.
1170
You're really excited to be around and be interacting with one another.
1171
And together, you set really high goals, a high bar, high objective for yourself.
1172
And you work heck and you go achieve those goals.
1173
And then once you're done, you don't rest.
1174
You do a post-mortem.
1175
You look at what you did.
1176
Can you do better?
1177
What were the mistakes?
1178
Because there were all those mistakes and how do you improve upon those?
1179
And there may be competition along the way, but you're really not so much focused on the competition.
1180
You want to use those opportunities to get better, to improve yourself.
1181
And then when you reach those goals, you put up bigger goals and you just keep going.
1182
And that drive excitement really permeated the culture of the organization.
1183
And the people saw that we talked about it.
1184
The management all knew it.
1185
Even today, you can ask managers all the way down the organization.
1186
I think people certainly understand divine discontent.
1187
I think they hopefully practice it.
1188
We're a bigger organization.
1189
I know that isn't as broad or widespread as it once was, but that core of divine discontent is certainly still there.
1190
It reminds me a little bit of that story about in the early days arriving at core values and the definition of fun and you and Brett working through that.
1191
Could you go through that story a bit?
1192
We hired a third party and brought together a broad cross-section of our senior team with the objective of defining Assurance core values.
1193
It was a process that we were broken up into groups and those groups would work together for a period of time and we'd have their ideas and we'd come back.
1194
And it was interesting how this emerged.
1195
People were voting on it.
1196
So there's some sense of, oh, we're going to vote on our core values, which with the benefit of hindsight was not probably the way to go because they are what they are.
1197
It's not what you think they are necessarily.
1198
And we went through the process.
1199
One core value that emerged on many people's lists was the idea of fun or the core value of fun.
1200
We want to have fun in what we don't want to enjoy.
1201
We want to be excited by it.
1202
And while a number of groups put it there, it just didn't feel right.
1203
I was, I'm not sure that fun is what we're trying to do.
1204
And then one of our long-standing employees, a gentleman and Rodney Schwasser, had been with us for a long time, he raised his hand.
1205
And we were talking about fun.
1206
He's, look, this is not fun.
1207
That's not the right word.
1208
It's winning.
1209
Winning is fun.
1210, we want to win.
1211
Let's not sugarcoat this or try to put a different face on that, what it really is.
1212
We're here to win.
1213
And there was a hall moment there of, yes, and it connects with divine discontent.
1214
It's interesting how the true core value does emerge.
1215
It's about who you are, not the name you might put on it.
1216
It was interesting how that just emerged from that process.
1217
And then there was also an honesty in your culture, and specifically, maybe as it related to people finding their long-term roles and how you thought about giving feedback to people.
1218
One of the things we did well over time was we had a strong discipline around talent management.
1219
We recognized we were on a rocket ship.
1220
We had a team that was driving, in some cases, holding on because it was growing so quickly.
1221
And we knew intuitively that people who were in those seats were not necessarily going to be people who could take us to the next level.
1222
And one of the things we did really well is we were honest with ourselves and with our team about the roles they were playing now and would they be in those seats in the next couple of years.
1223
And it turns out we ended up switching over the entire management team about three times over the course of seven years.
1224
And it was mostly proactive in the sense that we knew that the people in the role couldn't take us to the next level.
1225, sometimes we obviously made personnel mistakes where we had the wrong person in the wrong seat and we had to address that.
1226
But we were pretty rigorous about that.
1227
I give us pretty high marks because when you hire into a role, chances are you got maybe a 50-50 chance of making a great hire.
1228
And I think it's as important, if not more important, to correct that mistake as quickly as possible.
1229
That really did allow us to take full advantage of the opportunity because the industry was growing so fast.
1230
We had opportunities both domestically and internationally, and we were integrating vertically in the value chain.
1231
So so much had to be done that it was critical for us to get the right people in the right seats during that period of time, or we would have nearly taken as much advantage of the opportunity that we had.
1232, those are not easy conversations.
1233
Any lessons learned on handling those?
1234
The best advice I'd have of what I try to do, but as is always the case, we never do as good a job as we want to.
1235
And that's being consistent and constant in your feedback and having an open dialogue with your team members, so that there's not a lot of ambiguity between how you think he or she's performing and how he or she thinks he is performing.
1236
So, having those constant conversations makes the ultimate conversation around its time to leave a lot easier because you almost arrive to it at the same place at the same time.
1237
And just being honest with yourself and being honest with those people and having the courage to have that, because those are difficult conversations.
1238
We know we avoid them, we don't having them, but it's the right thing to do at your job.
1239
It also helps the employee because if they're not performing, they need to know.
1240
Otherwise, they have no chance of redirecting or addressing that.
1241
And I think as long as you're having those conversations on a regular basis, it helps you hold your feet to the fire and taking these actions that should be taken on a timely basis.
1242
The other thing that was helpful, and this is helpful having a partner, is holding each other accountable.
1243
If it's just you, then it's easy to push off or allow somebody to stay in a spot thinking he or she may improve over time a little bit faster.
1244
And it's always great just to have, in this case, we were partners, effectively operated as partners.
1245
So being able to hold each other accountable for our team was really helpful.
1246
If you don't have that person, then having a board member or an executive coach or a mentor really is helpful in prompting you to see clearly what's happening.
1247
Did you and Brett, as you're sorting through that, ever disagree?
1248
We rarely disagreed.
1249
One of the things I liked about our relationship was we didn't get stuck in a specific point of view or position.
1250
I think both of us were pretty good about allowing the data or the information or new information to change our minds.
1251
We may have had differences in small areas now and then.
1252
We would allow the person who really had key authority over that domain to make the decision.
1253
I think only once.
1254
Will there was a time it was about a specific individual where we disagreed on whether to keep this person or not.
1255
That went on for six months.
1256
It was a situation where I thought this person needed to exit the company and Brett wasn't quite there yet.
1257
How we managed that was really more us continuing to converse about it.
1258
It took, I think, six months longer than it should have.
1259
And eventually that person did exit the company.
1260
The way we ran the company, if one of us really believed that somebody needed to exit, it had to happen because once a person has lost the confidence with one of us, then it's ultimately not going to work out.
1261
We worked our way through that, I say, slowly and carefully because you want to be careful because you're protecting an important relationship.
1262
You want to do what's right for the company, but the relationship that he and I had together, our working relationship, it was pretty instrumental to how we operated as a company.
1263
And doing that well could take the company in positive direction or negative direction.
1264
A related thing is this idea of lack of hierarchy.
1265
I think it was one of these TA years, 2005, something that.
1266
Company added 50% more employees in a single year, right?
1267
How did you keep from hierarchy creeping in?
1268
You do the best you can.
1269
Of course, it's going to seep into any organization.
1270
You try to model it as best you can.
1271
Having a low ego or being humble was an important part of the ethos of a Shurian in that you're setting high goals together, you're working together to reach those goals, but you're also open to constructive criticism.
1272
And when you do those post-mortems to get better, it does take people letting their guard down, being comfortable, having constructive criticism directed their way.
1273
So that does help from a hierarchy perspective.
1274
In growing companies, managers, leaders, set of responsibilities get divided all the time.
1275
And so people seeing that a senior leader as the company grows might have a section of his or her responsibilities cleaved out and given to somebody else, not under them, but beside them.
1276
Those are always challenging conversations.
1277
People feel you're taking responsibility away from them.
1278
But it's necessary in a growing enterprise to have great people focus in key areas, and particularly as the scale underneath it is increasing at the same time.
1279
That was how we thought about the example we tried to make.
1280
I think one of the mechanisms we used to help promote that was a mechanism we call Power of Ten.
1281
It's an exercise in focus and prioritization, but it helps people to see that this is not about hierarchy because what we would do is we take every so often for a really important event.
1282
It could be a contract renewal, it could be going after a new client, it could be some other negotiation, it could be a supply chain problem or an operational glitch.
1283
And we would pull together a handful, maybe a half dozen people who had knowledge and something to contribute to that problem or issue.
1284
And it didn't have to be the CEO or the head of that client.
1285
It could be somebody who is lower down in the organization, who had the details and understood it at a deeper level.
1286
And we will bring that group together in focus time, call it two to three hour increments, maybe do it two or three times, and have prep material in advance to allow people to think about these issues.
1287
And I know it sounds simple, but it's wildly effective at just getting a handful of people, the right people at whatever level in the organization focused on a problem, not worried about the meeting that came from, the meeting going to.
1288
And we found you always, in every instance, would come up with alternatives that individually you never got to.
1289
It was a powerful mechanism.
1290
We still use it today.
1291
Can you talk a little bit about organizational mobility is a principle for top talent?
1292
We believed in terms of the best way to develop your people is to give them a wide range of responsibilities across the organization.
1293
And in particular for your high potential leaders, those that you want to continue to rise up in the organization.
1294
I will tell you, it's really easy for them to rise up in their functional area, but to give them cross-functional experiences to meet other people and network within the company.
1295
Longer term, that has a much greater impact on the business.
1296
In fact, when you look at our executive committee, Will, I think the average tenure may be approaching 10 years and some 15 to 20.
1297
It's a long tenure group of people.
1298
Across a breadth of roles.
1299
Across a breadth of roles, yes.
1300
Compensation.
1301
Can you talk a little bit, Kevin, about specifically equity compensation and how you've evolved your approach?
1302, you started out as a search fund, right?
1303
A rigid mode to that.
1304
How did the company's approach to equity compensation evolve over time as you're bringing in these A players?
1305
This is where we benefited early on from having a tremendous board of advisors, directors who could help us think about these types of issues.
1306
And while it is certainly important from a shareholder return perspective to shepherd equity very carefully, part of the ethos early on was you need to reward management team and have them aligned with the shareholder base.
1307
And that meant distributing options as a key part of the management incentive plan.
1308
And that was built in early on as part of our comp structure.
1309
It certainly was for Jim and I.
1310
And in order to attract the very best people, the Gerald risks of the world, to pull him out of his current role at a much lower salary, we needed to use equity and the promise of that as a key factor in bringing him in and other important leaders of the organization.
1311
It connected to being able to get great people, really, because when you're a small company, you're getting these really talented people to come work for a small roadside assistance company in Houston, Texas, or a cell phone insurance company in Nashville.
1312
Why would they do that?
1313
Well, you've got a great story because you get to be part of this leadership team as opposed to being a cog in the wheel in a large company.
1314
You get to be part of the leadership team, you get to be in on the decision making.
1315
And we've got this great vision that we've laid out to the extent we work hard and reach those goals.
1316
You can not only be part of that, be rewarded by it as well.
1317
And we tried to push this as far down in the organization as we could.
1318
And it had fits and starts over time, but we ended up pushing it all the way down to the manager level.
1319
So, those people who come in right after business school, in particular, get slugs of equity right away.
1320
When did that happen?
1321
When did that pushing down deeper into the organization occur?
1322
Was that a TA-era thing?
1323
It was really a TA and Brett era thing.
1324
We believed in it and certainly needed equity to hire the key senior managers.
1325
But once Brett came on board around 2001-2002 timeframe, we were much more rigorous in our thinking about how to drive that down further in the organization and get people at the VP, director, manager level aligned toward these goals.
1326
Another interesting aspect of our compensation will was this idea of full potential.
1327
So, consistent with the buying, just content, reaching for those goals.
1328
We have a bonus plan that was a fair bonus plan that people would strive for, obviously.
1329
But we don't always have this souped up or supercharged bonus plan for hitting full potential because we didn't want to be that company that put out low targets and beat it.
1330
By the way, in any organization, that's the natural state, or people will tend toward that as you get more and more people because it's easier.
1331
Everybody wants to hit their goal.
1332
So you set a lower one.
1333
And if you beat it, nobody asks questions.
1334
And that's the road to mediocrity, honestly.
1335
Then you're just maintaining.
1336
You're not really pushing yourself.
1337
So we always have this full potential bonus that was something that was stretch and orientation.
1338
We would never really hit it all, but I can tell you it helped get us well beyond the reasonable plan we put in place and well toward the full potential of what we could be.
1339
You saw it in the results.
1340, the growth in the 2001 to 2007 timeframe was incredible.
1341
And super roughly, where did that kick in?
1342
If budget was 100, then the full potential, it was really unbounded, but think about 150.
1343
The bonus would accelerate after the 100.
1344
And as a rule of thumb, for every dollar above hitting that plan, management will get a third of all the dollars that we made in that year.
1345
So an outsized portion of that pool over budget came to the management team.
1346
So it was an incredible motivator to really achieve full potential.
1347
How did you guys think about providing liquidity to shareholders, to management owners?
1348
It's an important consideration, particularly as a private company.
1349
And we never really had a desire to be a public company and still don't.
1350
That said, if you're a private company and you're insane people with equity, you do need to find ways to get not only your employees' equity, which is important, but your shareholders as well over time.
1351
And we'd endeavor to have some liquidity event every couple of years.
1352
What we found, particularly with our management team, was that equity incentives really worked, but if they don't see liquidity within a three-year period, then the value of that incentive tends to start declining because they're wondering: is this really a value?
1353
Is this really here?
1354
And having some level of consistency and track record of liquidity events is important to maintain the value of that incentive.
1355
So we would have either a debt recap or a debt and equity recap or sometimes dividends along the way.
1356
A lot of shareholders did well by Assurian, but I will tell you, Will, the thing that feels really good is we have that conversation with the director-level person who may have made a few hundred thousand dollars on a recapitalization where they sold some of their equity and they're set up for retirement.
1357
They're put to kids through college.
1358
To be able to have that impact on your employees' lives is really gratifying.
1359
Can you touch, Kevin, on the Compassion Forward program that you guys started?
1360
Compassion Forward project is a philanthropic organization that we created internally at Assurion, and it was giving by Assurian employees in support of Assurian employees.
1361
We want to, most organizations, want to be part of the ethos to be giving back into helping the community.
1362
We happened upon it.
1363
It was one of our mid-level managers who came up with this concept of Compassion Forward.
1364
And we realized we have tens, well, we have 23,000, but we have so many employees who are hourly employees.
1365
And if they have a traumatic or problematic or big issue in their lives, then they might not have the money to pay for it.
1366
It could be additional health care costs for that person or somebody in their family.
1367
It could be a death in the family and just being able to bury them.
1368, there are events in people's lives where they just need financial help.
1369
So we created this fund and the company seeded it.
1370
And eventually employees can deduct from the paycheck and put into it.
1371
And then it's managed by a group of managers who get applications from people who have issues.
1372
And we gift and donate money to these individuals on a regular basis.
1373
It's really helpful.
1374
We've got thousands of employees in the Philippines.
1375
And whenever there's a hurricane there, a lot of people are displaced and put out of their homes and have to rebuild their lives.
1376
And we use the Compassion Forward fund for that as well.
1377
So it really helps build community and connection within the Assuring Network.
1378
It's something we think is pretty innovative and helps tie that team feeling together.
1379
We try to promulgate this to companies who've got an evangelist who will go out to other companies and describe Compassion Forward and how it works with the hopes that other companies do this as well.
1380
That's very cool.
1381
All right.
1382
So shifting gears for a minute, going back to that TA01 period, one of the trends during that period was industry consolidation, right?
1383
So, could you touch on that a little bit?
1384
And basically, that's taking the customer concentration issue, which is central to the business, and if anything, extending it, emphasizing it.
1385
Could you just talk a little bit about that trend?
1386
We benefited greatly from being attached to the wireless industry, obviously.
1387
That where the number of customers with wireless handsets grew from 10 million when we started, I think, in 95 to ultimately over 300 million.
1388
And when we started out, there were scores and scores of wireless companies that were set up almost by MSA.
1389
But a lot of industries that, it just consolidated really, really quickly.
1390
So I think certainly by 2000, the top three to five carriers would own 70 to 85 percent of the market.
1391
So it was clear back in the early 2000s, we were going to be in a consolidating industry.
1392
That's just really the way it had to be for the economies of scale to work for them, which meant customer relationship management was going to be critical.
1393
It was always important, by the way, to be working with the acquiring company because if company A acquired company B, then the vendors and partners of company A would tend to win out as well.
1394
And that worked largely in our favor in the early 2000s.
1395
But we knew then that it was a concentrated industry and we really did two key things.
1396
One was focus on client relationship management, keep them close and keep them happy.
1397
And two, diversify.
1398
So we're always in this search to look for growth outside of the wireless industry or in different areas of the wireless industry in order to lower the risk that comes with concentration.
1399
As it turns out, working within a concentrated industry can be a good thing.
1400
It allows you to focus.
1401
And if you've got a great product and you've done a good job of managing the client relationship so that they view you, your company, your product as strategically important to them, which was one of, again, back to Brett's superpowers, one of the things he was able to do for us, then you embed yourself in that organization and are able to continue to grow along with it.
1402
We've been successful at doing that over a long period of time in a consolidated industry.
1403
As it relates to Brett's time in managing that increasing, growing, already high customer concentration piece, how did that affect the way he spent his time as CEO?
1404
At least a third of his time, if not more, was spent in client relationship management.
1405
I can say the same for myself.
1406
It was important for us to get to know the most senior levels of our clients.
1407
If you're successful at doing that, then you have a seat at the table to pitch them new ideas and to help continue to grow with them and evolve your product suite with them in a way that's more difficult to do when you're down at the mid-levels.
1408
And we were effective at doing that over time.
1409
There's a great story of Brett wanting to meet the then CEO of our largest carrier partner.
1410
And he was very strategic about it.
1411
He found out through that CEO's assistant that he liked to work out at five o'clock in the morning whenever he was traveling for these conferences.
1412
So, Brett, who really didn't work out as much before this, started working out at shocking to five in the morning.
1413
And he would meet the CEO.
1414
They'd be the only two people in the gym.
1415
He'd be there successive days in a row.
1416
They get to talking and know each other.
1417
And that's the start.
1418
It's very creative.
1419
It's thoughtful.
1420
The time he spent to figure that out was critically important.
1421
As important, if not more important, Will, is okay, now that you've got the audience, what do you say?
1422
What do you have to contribute?
1423
And Brett was always prepared.
1424
So he knew how to position our product to make it strategically important to the wireless carriers.
1425
And it was really all about providing an amazing customer service, driving loyalty and reducing churn for them, as well as revenue generation.
1426
And given our place in the industry, we were able just to do that in spades for these carriers and become a real important strategic partner with them.
1427
You look back at that period.
1428
It seems there was at least one period very early on where there was some risk, some scariness, which related to that early claims process system implementation, 04-ish.
1429
Can you talk a little bit about what that was?
1430
Companies growing super fast, but within that, you got to kerfuffle.
1431
We've had a few of those.
1432
I certainly remember the claim system failing.
1433
That almost brought us down.
1434
I think we were down for two weeks and doing things manually.
1435
In the early days, particularly in a concentrated industry, a few bad moves can derail the entire system.
1436
As a manager, you want to be taking risk out of the system wherever you can.
1437
The claim system problem, that was just self-inflicted.
1438
That was, we made the classic mistake of moving from an old system to a new system without the ability to fall back if things didn't go well.
1439
It was as basic as that.
1440
And the new system didn't work.
1441
Everything went to manual for about two weeks.
1442
It was all hands on deck.
1443
Every manager, every person in the organization.
1444
How did you guys personally deal with that?
1445
In the call center, helping people literally on the phones, taking claims.
1446
Everybody knew what to do.
1447
Certainly, there was making sure that the IT system was getting worked on in the background.
1448
But no, we were there, sleeves rolled up.
1449
We had to be there.
1450
And it was a tense time because we were getting calls from our clients saying, hey, what's going on?
1451
And we needed to be taking care of these customers who are used to very short hold times, very short cycle times in terms of getting their claims processed.
1452
And now they go from minutes into days and you get some angry customers.
1453
But we worked our way through it.
1454
We had built up a reservoir of goodwill with the clients such that we're able to manage our way through that.
1455
I can tell you we've not made that mistake again.
1456
Can you talk a little bit about the approach over the years you guys have had to testing and learning new products?
1457
As I look back over the course of time with Assurion, you can see this nice curve where things have gone up into the right.
1458
We made some good strategic moves along the way.
1459
It's funny, people ask: did you envision all this?
1460
Did you have this strategy from the outset?
1461
And the answer is absolutely not.
1462
I call what we've done strategy by experimentation.
1463
We were in the flow.
1464
We attached ourselves to a great industry.
1465
And while we knew directionally where we wanted to go for the most part, we didn't know exactly what was going to win or not.
1466
So you're always placing bets.
1467
You're always placing not an infinite number, but a handful of bets and you want to execute those bets well and importantly you double down on the ones that work and you kill the ones that don't and we've had a number over the years that have not worked fortunately we've had enough of the bets do work along the way and I think of that not just in products but in acquisitions.
1468
When we bought the Merrimack group, well that was making a small bet in a new product to the same channel distribution, but wasn't betting the firm.
1469
And then through the course of the early 2000s, we were betting in another way to diversify other products sold through the wireless channel.
1470
We developed a product called Pay Assure, which was to help carriers attract credit challenge customers, which they weren't bringing on at that time.
1471
It was really a little bit before the pre-pay era.
1472
We had another business called Ashuria Managed Wireless, where we would take over the management of all of the handsets for an enterprise.
1473
And so there'd be lifecycle management as well as tracking of those devices.
1474
And we got them up and running.
1475
We stood them up.
1476
And both of those turned out for different reasons not to work out.
1477
So we shut them down.
1478
But others along the way were successful.
1479
In addition to handset protection, we made little bets in integrating into the value chain, whether it was getting into the reverse logistics or repair business.
1480
And once we found that those worked, we were able to grow.
1481
We have a long history of just testing and learning.
1482
That's an almost perfect segue, I think.
1483
We're going to return to the MA topic, which we've touched on before.
1484
And this is an 800-pound large bet.
1485
Let's shift and talk a little bit about Lockline and how that unfolded over time, maybe from earliest days when you guys came across the company.
1486
Yeah, so Lockline was in our sites right from 1999 when we started looking at Hanson Protection.
1487
There were three players.
1488
We ended up buying the Merrimack Group, but we talked to Lockline.
1489
We saw it there, and there was Signal out there as well.
1490
Once we completed the acquisition of the Merrimack Group in 99, and we never lost focus on one of these others, and we reinitiated conversations with Lockline more subsequently in 2002.
1491
They were owned by an insurance agency in Kansas City.
1492
We put in a bid, they took themselves out to auction, and we thought we had a generous offer in there.
1493
They were telling us that there were other bidders.
1494
We didn't believe them.
1495
We were wrong.
1496
And another Kansas City-based company ended up buying them for maybe 10% more than we were offering.
1497
It was such a disappointment to have that slip through our fingers.
1498
And we could have easily paid that and more.
1499
I think we were obstinate and overly confident in our position that we were the logical buyer of this and who else would buy this?
1500
Well, turns out we were wrong on that.
1501
So that went away.
1502
We re-engaged them two years later.
1503
The buyer who prevailed in that process before, strategic or financial buyer?
1504
Somewhere in between.
1505
It was a company called DST Systems.
1506
They're also based in Kansas City.
1507
They had a history of investing in companies outside of their core business.
1508
They weren't a private equity financial buyer.
1509
Typically, that is essentially what they were doing in this case because there were no obvious synergies between what Lockwine did and what DST did.
1510
And for that reason, we thought we could pull it out again at a much higher price than what they paid for.
1511
The conversation started.
1512
It was clear that I was not going to make headway with the CEO of DST.
1513
How would you summarize why?
1514
Different generation.
1515
The CEO was older.
1516
He's certainly well established in the Kansas City community and known somewhat nationally.
1517
And in some ways, I was beneath this station.
1518
So we brought in the big guns.
1519
We brought in Irv from the board and our general counsel concigliary, amazing attorney, Dick Floor from Goodron-Proctor.
1520
He and Irv and the DST systems CEO were all of similar age and stature.
1521
And that helped us get in the door.
1522
I think it played to their ego, which was a factor.
1523
It got us to the table where we started the discussions.
1524
And there were some long negotiations, but it came to a head in 2006 when we were able to bring it all together in a transaction where we bought Lockline largely for stock.
1525
And DST ended up owning almost a third of the company.
1526
Explain the location wrinkle.
1527
One of the great things about Lockline is we were in the industry together.
1528
We probably knew as much about them as they knew about themselves.
1529
And there was such a great value to be created by putting the two companies together because we could take their business model, apply ours to it, and create tremendous value because we had this vertically integrated approach and we could increase their EBITDA X fold almost on day one.
1530
We wanted this to happen because we knew value was going to get created.
1531
That said, it was a stock deal.
1532
We're marrying these people, and DSD would have two board seats in a third of the company, and negotiations during that time are always challenging, but they were fraught a little bit by the fact that negotiating with one another, but you're also seeing how the other person is treating you along the way because you're going to be partners.
1533
And right at the last minute, at the 11th hour, we're about to sign a deal, and lo and behold, a wrinkle emerges.
1534
The seller wants to ensure that we maintain a presence in Kansas City, a physical presence for a long period of time because it was important to him that jobs stay in the community.
1535
And this was going to have an impact on the synergies because we had imagined contracting materially.
1536
So we went back into our own room and thought about it.
1537
It became clear the loss of that synergy wasn't going to be enough to derail the deal in any way.
1538
But how we were being treated along the way didn't feel good.
1539
So I reached out to Irv and got advice from him.
1540
He wisely said, Look, now at least who you're dealing with.
1541
And this is somebody you're going to have to deal with for the next years.
1542
Are you sure you want to go through with it?
1543
I didn't even hesitate.
1544
I can endure a lot of pain if the value is there.
1545
And we just knew the value was going to be there.
1546
That's why we're willing to stretch in terms of the size of this deal as a percent of our enterprise value.
1547
And we were marrying this organization.
1548
I knew there were going to be challenges with it, but I felt we'll figure that out in the future, but let's create value in the near term.
1549
And lo and behold, we went ahead and closed the deal.
1550
And fortunately, both things came true.
1551
We created a lot of value, and the marriage was fraught.
1552
It didn't work out very well.
1553
Quick math on that is enterprise value is just over $400 million, $480 million.
1554
DST takes that all in stock, a little over a third of the company.
1555
So big, chunky bet, valuing their business at about 50% of enterprise value beforehand for the company, right?
1556
So that's a big bet.
1557
As a multiple of cash flow, that's around 10 times trailing EBITDA and about seven and a half times the projected EBITDA for next year, but that's before synergies, which even after Kansas City are gigantic here.
1558
If you factor those in, multiple paid is six, six and a half times EBITDA, just to frame all that.
1559
Can you talk a little bit about the integration process, how that went?
1560
That went shockingly smoothly.
1561
We had a couple months before close to line that up.
1562
And this is a big deal.
1563
We hired some advisors and experts in Maine, and they helped us with the merger integration process and how to manage that because we hadn't really done anything this big before.
1564
And probably the most important element of that integration being successful was getting aligned with their CEO, Chuck Wow.
1565
So Chuck came with the company.
1566
He had led the company and he was going to come in and partner with Brett and I as really a Troika in terms of managing the business.
1567
And he was all in.
1568
And once his management team saw that he was in, we were aligned, everything else fell into place.
1569
It made all the other decisions easier.
1570
And we knew how we were going to integrate these two companies.
1571
It was going to happen day one.
1572
So the day the deal closed, we had the org chart set out.
1573
We brought in every manager one-on-one, right?
1574
And Chuck and I spoke to each of the individually: you're in this lot, you're in this lot, you're in this lot.
1575
A few people didn't have slots, and those were tougher conversations, but we made them.
1576
And so we got the org structure done day one.
1577
And it took a couple of weeks, but we got alignment on the approach we were going to take.
1578
Part of it was operational, which wasn't as important, but it was really a client management getting aligned on that.
1579
And basically, the big win was taking their client base and converting it to our business model and doing that sequentially.
1580
And that served to generate increasing amounts of EBITDA over the next few years.
1581
Just to super roughly,, this is inexact, but if you looked at the value creation from that, again, enterprise value paid was $400 million roughly.
1582
EBITDA created from that, probably two times that amount at minimum.
1583
So really glad that deal happened.
1584
That'd be fair to say, Kevin.
1585
It was a pretty seminal transaction for us.
1586
Now, we would have loved to have been able to purchase a company for 200 million a few years earlier and gotten these synergies sooner, but it was a huge win for certainly the shareholders, company, and I think for customers and the carriers because we became a stronger partner to the carriers and we're able to offer more services over time.
1587
All right, so let's skip the capital allocation and TA period here.
1588
You look at the data for the first four or five years after Jeff and TA make the investment, leverage is pretty negligible, pretty low across that period of time.
1589
Is that fair to say?
1590
It is fair to say, yeah.
1591
And business is just generating so much cash, it's able to fund its growth that you guys were just focused elsewhere.
1592
So the first thing that happens after a long period of time is there's a dividend recap transaction in the middle of 06, almost exactly five years into TA's ownership.
1593
It's big.
1594
$750 million dividend recap, financed entirely with debt.
1595
It takes leverage overnight to just over four times EBITDA, 4.1 times.
1596
Do you remember all that?
1597
It was our first large transaction since TA.
1598
And in the preceding three or four years, our focus was so much on just holding on, scaling, managing this business that not a lot of time and attention had been put on optimizing the balance sheet.
1599
Because along the way, with the benefit of hindsight, we should have been doing some share repurchases that would have gotten people liquidity.
1600
And those transactions are highly accretive to remaining shareholders.
1601
I think two reasons.
1602
One, we were really focused on the core business and it was growing really fast.
1603
But two, nobody wanted to sell.
1604
It's not there was a desire of shareholders in this timeframe to sell because everybody saw what was going on.
1605
So they were excited to be part of it.
1606
And then even more so when we closed the lockline transaction earlier that year in 2006.
1607
And then, so, all right, we fast forward, we get through that.
1608
Still, nobody wants to sell shares, but they recognize that, look, we've got plenty of capacity on the balance sheet here to lever up, get some returns back to shareholders.
1609
And that's when we did a pretty big dividend.
1610
I think it was a little over a third of our enterprise value at the time and basically ended up dividending 750 million out to our shareholders.
1611
On the share repurchase front, there's one other event midway through October 04.
1612
You guys bought in about $25 million worth of stock, which was about 6% of shares outstanding, right?
1613
So that first one in 99 that we talked about was about 10%, but this was another 6%.
1614
Returns on that piece have been also pretty extraordinary.
1615
A 70 times multiple of invested capital and a 56% IRR over 17 years.
1616
That was definitely worth doing.
1617
That's the thumbnail summary on capital allocation in the TA period.
1618
And the next event is 07, the equity recap.
1619
Can you talk a little bit about the timing for that?
1620
How you guys thought about that point in time?
1621
There were two things happening.
1622
There were two reasons we ended up doing the transaction.
1623
The market was incredibly frothy.
1624, this is leading up to the financial crisis.
1625
Our timing couldn't have been better, honestly.
1626
But not that people want,, TA was six years into their transaction.
1627
So it was from their perspective, all right, we've been in.
1628
This has been a nice ride for us.
1629
Let us take our chips off the table.
1630
So there's some interest level there.
1631
And then you combine that with the market being incredibly strong at the time.
1632
It was a topic of discussion, but really drove it from my perspective.
1633
It gave us an opportunity to get DST liquidity.
1634
And that's the euphemism for get them off the cap table.
1635 the marriage didn't work.
1636
As I said, we created a lot of value with the merger of Assurion and Lockline, but the board dynamics were challenging.
1637
I didn't get along with their two board members.
1638
There was constant friction there.
1639
Other board members didn't get along with them.
1640
And I just knew this was going to be better longer term if we got them liquidity and got them the chance to move them off the board.
1641
It was really those factors coming together where we decided we're going to run a process here.
1642
And we ran a process.
1643
I remember going through it.
1644
This is how frothy times were.
1645
We were interviewing private equity firms.
1646
So we would go out and see if we'd even let them into the process.
1647
It was certainly a heady time.
1648
We were walking into conference rooms, and the first thing that some of these partners would say to us, just name your price.
1649
I'll pay whatever.
1650
And certainly that felt great, felt validating.
1651
The process ended with us picking one party to negotiate with, one winner, if you will, highest price.
1652
We wanted to negotiate some of the terms.
1653
Then once we finished negotiating the terms with that private equity firm, we told them, look, you've got lead and we're going to give you this much allocation, but I'm going to take this same deal and give it to the other two finalists and give them the option to join the party.
1654
And here's why.
1655
We don't want one private equity firm controlling our direction.
1656
It was important to us that we had a group of people around the table who were ultimately looking out for the best interest of the company long term and not necessarily one particular fund.
1657
So we ended up negotiating originally with Madison-Dearborn, but we brought Welsh Carson and Providence Equity into the deal.
1658
All the time, interestingly, Irv was in the background saying, This is a really frothy market.
1659
I would encourage you to work as fast as you can get through this process.
1660
And his words couldn't have been more pressing because our debt deal that went along with the equity was the second to last deal in early July 2007 that closed.
1661
And then I think one deal the next day closed, debt deal, and then the window shut for quarters and quarters.
1662
I don't even know.
1663
It was certainly over a year while the window was shut.
1664
And we managed to get that transaction done.
1665
And that turned out to be a pretty seminal transaction for us for a number of reasons.
1666
It's really impossible to overstate how rare that cap table is.
1667
If you look at the final ownership post-transaction, the original investors and management team continued to own 40% of the company.
1668
Madison Dearborn owns 22%.
1669
Providence Equity owns 22%.
1670
Welsh Carson owns 11%.
1671
So the private equity group collectively, club, so to speak, is 55% controlled, but just barely.
1672
And DST continued to own 6%.
1673
So those sorts of transactions, those club transactions are very common in venture capital.
1674
They're very uncommon in private equity.
1675
So definitely a mark of the times.
1676
A few other points around that, just bringing the information together.
1677
So the total enterprise value for that 07 transaction was $4.1 billion, $3.4 billion equity value.
1678
And TA exited their position entirely.
1679
So for TA, that gave them an even 12x return on their original $60 million investment, or just over 49% IRR.
1680
A lot of the original search fund investors ended up exiting in 07.
1681
Not all of them, but a healthy chunk of them did.
1682
And if you look at their IRR math, from the 1995 original transaction through 07, that's a 468x outcome and a 72%, slightly better, IRR.
1683
So reasonably good outcome.
1684
And if you look at the TA period, and you just look at the operating math, it's interesting where revenues go from just over $110 million when they join to just over $1.2 billion.
1685
So it's a 10X growth in revenue.
1686
And the EBITDA goes from 30 to just over 300.
1687
So again, 10X growth in EBITA, 10X growth in revenue.
1688
So that's a pretty good six-year period of time.
1689
We certainly had a good run during that period.
1690
That's for sure.
1691
That was a pretty good run.
1692
Thank you, Kevin, for your time.
1693
And what an incredible story.
1694
Thanks so much for sharing.
1695
As I mentioned before, there have been two constants at Assurion over the last 28 years.
1696
Co-founder, CEO, chairman Kevin Tawil, whom we met last time, and Irv Grossbeck, a lead board member and investor since the original acquisition.
1697
Irv had two distinct careers.
1698
First, he was the co-founder with his partner Amos Hostetter of Continental Cablevision, a pioneering cable television company.
1699
Irv was the president of Continental from 1964 to 1980 and remained a director, serving as chairman for a time after that.
1700
And so, just to take a minute on Continental, basically, everyone in the cable television business in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s did well.
1701
However, there are two records that stand out: one public and one private.
1702
The public one belonged to John Malone at a company called TCI.
1703
The other one was lasser-known and belonged to Irv and his partner Amos at Continental.
1704
The company had a reputation as the best run in the industry and it also had phenomenal returns.
1705
The company, as I mentioned, was founded in 1964, and its IRR over the ensuing 35 years was over 30% with total multiples of invested capital to shareholders who held their stock of over 5,000 X.
1706
So, again, not too bad.
1707
By the way, when Irv and I first spoke about this podcast, I told him about 50X and he jokingly mentioned that the title was wimpy.
1708
After all, he had been involved with two companies that are around 100 times 50X.
1709
So, again, that's a pretty reasonable background for this podcast.
1710
Anyway, following Continental, Irv became a professor, first at the Harvard Business School and since 1986 at the Stanford Business School, where he has been one of the most acclaimed teachers for over 30 years.
1711
He is the co-founder of the Center for Entrepreneurial Studies, which now accounts for almost half of the courses in the second-year curriculum at Stanford.
1712
On a personal note, Irv has been a key advisor to me for the last 30-plus years.
1713
I would describe him as my personal board of directors, which is a very elite group, as Irv is the only member.
1714
And it meets once a year at his house, typically in New Hampshire.
1715
And I can say that on several occasions, that advice has been pivotal for me in my career decisions.
1716
It's also worth noting in an early echo of this podcast that Kevin Tweil and I audited Irv's class at Stanford in 1992 due to low lottery numbers, which prevented us from gaining normal entry.
1717
All right.
1718
So, Irv, thanks very much for joining us.
1719
And let's dive in.
1720
Well, thank you for those kind words, some of which are deserved and almost all of which are accurate.
1721
And I just want to point out that the continental returns don't hold a candle to the Assurian returns.
1722
It's a pretty rarefied zip code.
1723
If you don't mind, Irv, let's start with a little bit of your background from the early days before you became a professor.
1724
Maybe starting with how you and Amos found your way into cable television after your initial search.
1725
So we were friends and fraternity brothers from Amherst College, and I graduated from HBS in 1960, and he graduated in 1961.
1726
He's two and a half years younger than I.
1727
We were conducting separate searches for a company to start or buy and just comparing notes with each other.
1728
He was working then for an individual investor in Boston, and I was a case writer at Harvard Business School.
1729
This is during the period 1962 to 1964.
1730
And the investor for whom he worked had made a modest investment in the cable television system in Keene, New Hampshire.
1731
It's through that connection that we first, or I first heard about cable.
1732
But just prior to that, we decided to start working together as partners rather than just comparing notes as friends.
1733
It was the most ridiculous,, in retrospect search with no framework at all, despite our education and alleged intelligence.
1734
We looked at plastic inflatable toys, we looked at indoor tennis centers, we looked at residential fuel oil.
1735
It was just what could we find that might be interesting.
1736
Then, when he heard about cable television, it turned out that there was a company called Spencer Kennedy Laboratories, which was about a mile from Harvard Business School, and they made electronics for the then nascent cable industry.
1737
There was hardly an industry.
1738
There were just pockets of activity where the terrain was mountainous in places Pennsylvania and Oregon.
1739
And a fellow named Bob Brooks, who was a vice president of Spencer Kennedy Labs, took us under his wing, partly because he was a nice person, and partly, I suspect, because he thought if our crazy idea of starting a company ever materialized, maybe he could sell us some electronics equipment, amplifiers, specifically.
1740
So he helped us understand the industry.
1741
He told us a few states to look at, which included North and South Carolina and Ohio, where we eventually ended up, and some other states.
1742
And we took to doing an analysis of the propagation of television stations and population pockets.
1743
So we'd get a map and take a protractor and we'd apply a circle on that map as to what the A coverage and the B coverage of the television broadcast stations was.
1744
And we would look for places where there were opportunities.
1745
And we eliminated North and South Carolina.
1746
So finally, Amos and I decided that I would go to Ohio and we would split the cost, which was important to me since I had no money.
1747
And I would make a little foray out to Ohio.
1748
And there were some cities we had targeted out there to take a look at and really see what the lay of the land was.
1749
While we're on that burf, do you mind just telling the story of Kifton and those first systems and how they arose from that?
1750
I went to some promising cities that we had uncovered.
1751
One of them was Mansfield, Ohio.
1752
And in my infinite wisdom or lack thereof, I decided, no, there's an awful lot of what we called free signal, meaning available broadcast signal off air.
1753
No, I don't think so.
1754
Well, of course, since then, someone else came in and built a wildly successful system in Mansfield, Ohio.
1755
So that's boat number one we missed.
1756
Then I drove to Lima, Ohio, where there was a cable system under construction.
1757
And then I went to Finley, Ohio.
1758
Lima, Finley, Tiffin, and Faustoria, where we ended up, were all in northwestern Ohio, south of Toledo, near the Indiana border.
1759
So Finley had a franchise process that had already been started.
1760
A franchise means just a local ordinance that gives you the right to cross the general easement over the right of way to hang your cables and electronics.
1761
They hadn't granted anybody one there yet, but there was one in process.
1762
So then I went up the road to Tiffin and Fostoria, Ohio, which were in the range of 12 miles apart, maybe 14.
1763
And together they aggregated a population of 40,000.
1764
So we started the franchise process in Tiffin and Fostoria by hiring local lawyers and making our case that we had half an idea what we would do, which was not true either.
1765
But we had an idea, but we were a little lacking in the execution department.
1766
Well, I think come back to Continental at different points along the way here, but maybe let's talk a little bit about Kevin and Jim Ellis and how you came across them as casewriters and how they came together as partners.
1767
So I was interviewing in, I think it was the spring or maybe the winter of 1992, the year that you graduated as well.
1768
Well, I was interviewing people who had applied for casewriter and some of them had been in my class.
1769
But as you mentioned earlier, Kevin had not been in my class, but he showed up and said, I want this job.
1770
And my recollection, which could be retrofitting history, but he said, I want this job because I need this job and I don't have another job.
1771
And I think I'd be good at it.
1772
And I think I might want to be an entrepreneur, something along that line.
1773
So fortuitously, I hired him and he became a casewriter from 1992 to 1993.
1774
Then Jim Ellis, as you mentioned, took that role.
1775
He graduated in 1993 and took that role from 1993 to 1994.
1776
And of course, I don't know when they first met each other or how they became acquainted, but by the time Jim had taken over and was partway through his one-year term, he and Kevin were well acquainted.
1777
And do you remember the story of how they found Road Rescue?
1778
I do.
1779
I'm not the one to tell it, but I'll tell you my recollections are that Amos and me, they were coordinating their efforts, but separately looking for something to buy.
1780
And they had studied the towing industry.
1781
So Kevin wasn't as enthusiastic about towing business and towing-related businesses as Jim was.
1782
Jim persevered, and Kevin showed up one day and said, I found a business I think I might want to buy.
1783
It's a physician practice in Miami, Florida, and it serves the Hispanic community.
1784
And the doctor who's willing to sell it to me for a reasonable price is Hispanic himself.
1785
So everything's conducted in Spanish.
1786
Then sometime later, Kevin came back and said, well, wait, I don't know that I want to do that.
1787
He said, I talked to one of my prospective investors, Bill Egan, and his first question was, Do you speak Spanish?
1788
Well, I had to confess that I didn't speak Spanish.
1789
Bill said, You might have a pretty uphill fight figuring out how to buy and operate that company.
1790
And he said that turned the tide with me.
1791
And maybe there were other steps that intervened, but then he and Jim reunited.
1792
And Mr.
1793
Rescue, as I understand it, was an offshoot of learning about the towing industry.
1794
That opportunity came up in connection with their examination of towing.
1795
At that time, it was an offshoot that was growing very rapidly.
1796
Typical search deals, as I recall it at those very early days, were generally targeting more stable businesses.
1797
Right.
1798
Businesses that could, quote unquote, go once more around the track.
1799
Exactly.
1800
Yeah.
1801
And road rescue obviously was a completely different kettle of fish.
1802
I remember my question to Kevin was: but wait, most people belong to AAA, and then when you buy a new car, if you do, you get free roadside assistance.
1803
Why are they going to pay you for that?
1804
And he and Jim had a list of reasons why that was going to happen, which included better service, broader service offerings, so forth.
1805
In any event, I was not part of their search fund, either of their search funds, which they then combined.
1806
I was not an investor.
1807
They just were talking to me from time to time about what was going on.
1808
Can you talk a little bit about how you came to invest?
1809
My recollection is they pursued the acquisition of capital to buy Mr.
1810
Rescue.
1811
And they came back and said, We're $300,000 short.
1812
Would you want to put in $300,000?
1813
I said,, really, that's not good for me.
1814
It doesn't really work.
1815
And they said, well, what would work?
1816
And their capital structure, as you well know, was half debt and half equity.
1817
And I said, well, if that $300,000 would be divided $150,000 and $150,000, I said, I'd really to get $500 of equity, but that doesn't sound that works.
1818
So I'll help you find the other $300,000.
1819
They came back a while later and they said, we've decided there's room for you to put in the amount that you specified.
1820
And will you join the board?
1821
And I said, sure, I'd be glad to.
1822
And that sounds fine to me, even though I was extremely skeptical of the whole business.
1823
I thought these two people were AAA people, and that's really what I was investing in.
1824
But I thought their idea was close to crazy, that they were going to provide services to wireless industry customers that nobody knew much about at that time.
1825
And they were going to provide the same service for a fee that was being offered for nothing.
1826
I thought, boy, these guys are going to have to wave a magic wand to do anything, but I'll put my auntie into the middle of the table and see what happens.
1827
As Kevin and Jim describe it, the minute that they knew you were on the board, all the other search investors were very comfortable carving their investment back to accommodate you at that level.
1828
And one of those investors was a guy named Paul Ferry, who's the founder of a very well-known and respected venture capital partnership, Matrix Partners, who was, I believe, a longtime friend of yours.
1829
Or do you mind telling the story of his investment in that company in Road Rescue?
1830
Yes, Paul and I were longtime friends.
1831
We were neighbors, lived about a mile apart in Weston.
1832
We had gotten to know each other.
1833
I was not an investor with him, but we were good friends and we talked a lot.
1834
And I had a lot of high regard for him.
1835
And so this sounds a little self-promotional, but my understanding of the story is that Kevin and Jim sent him a FedEx package full of their PPM and arranged a meeting with him and went to Boston to meet with him.
1836
I don't know if this is true or not, but they got there and there was the package unopened on his desk.
1837
They thought, oh no, this is terrible.
1838
This is just going to be a courtesy meeting.
1839
And Paul said, well, okay, give me your story.
1840
And they gave him the story.
1841
And then he said, who do you have for investors?
1842
They gave him the list of investors, which at that point included me.
1843
And then he said, well, is Grossbeck going to be on the board?
1844
And they said, yes.
1845
And he said, I'm in.
1846
That's what I heard.
1847
I don't know if that's apocryphal or true.
1848
That is verbatim, Kevin and Jim's version, too.
1849
And Paul once told me that Ashurian was maybe the best return, the best investment he'd ever made, partly because of the returns, and partly because you had been involved, and he'd never had to go to a board meeting, which, of course, he liked very much.
1850, anybody involved with Assurian has never touched their returns in any other thing they did, I'm fully confident.
1851
So we're all in the same fortunate boat.
1852
Exactly.
1853
So, Kevin and Jim by the company, and can you talk a little bit about that board coming together?
1854
So, you were front and center in that, obviously.
1855
And the search doesn't use this term, but effectively, the chairman, at least in Kevin and Jim's mind, and I think other investors.
1856
But Bill Egan, Bob Oster, Joel Peterson, and David Dodson were the other.
1857
So, can you talk a little bit about that group and what made it an effective board?
1858
Well, first of all, the size.
1859
I love smaller boards for small growing companies.
1860
Why populate it with eight or ten people when you can have five or so, plus the principals?
1861
And it just is so much easier to manage and schedule and have discussions and have impromptu conversations as needed and get things done.
1862
And then, secondly, when you look at those four individuals, they were all experienced in some respect.
1863
David Dodson was the youngest, but he had bought a company and operated successfully.
1864
It produced good returns, and he had learned a lot about on-the-ground operation of a company that was in the alarm business in Texas.
1865
So he had operating skills.
1866
Obviously, Joel Peterson is a highly accomplished person, as is Bill Egan.
1867
Bob Oster had a lot of experience as well, operating companies.
1868
I think he was just beginning his record of investing in smaller enterprises, but he had a very practical turn of mind and was a no-nonsense person and said what he thought.
1869
And often it made a lot of sense.
1870
But they were people who really cared about trying to help Kevin and Jim build a good company.
1871
They weren't all about themselves and their backgrounds.
1872
And, oh, I've seen this before.
1873
And there was no conversation that.
1874
It was all people just trying to pitch in and help.
1875
Pretty early on, the company had an opportunity to sell itself at what would then have been a big multiple of capital, a double-digit multiple of the equity invested to a company that no longer exists called CUC.
1876
What was the discussion at the board level and sorting through the decision whether or not to pursue that?
1877
I have a general recollection that there were different points of view based on the backgrounds of the individuals.
1878
We all tend to speak from where we've been to some degree.
1879, I think part of the art of advice is trying to get outside that frame of reference and listen and think about things and be helpful to people, irrespective of where you've been.
1880
I don't mean to pontificate, but I do think that's helpful to people.
1881
But I didn't do that.
1882
I spoke from where I'd been, and Joel Peterson was an advocate for where he'd been.
1883
He's a world-class person with an unbelievably successful track record in a transactional business, which was real estate.
1884
His position, as I remember it, was: wow, somebody's offering you, was it $75 or $100 million?
1885
You're really just getting started, and somebody thinks you've got something here.
1886
Sell.
1887
Take your profits.
1888
You'll have investors for life.
1889
The world will be your oyster.
1890
You'll be investable as entrepreneurs.
1891
You'll have plenty of other opportunities.
1892
And my point of view was different, which was I wasn't saying you shouldn't sell.
1893
I was saying that the way I would make the decision is to think about what the runway was for you and the business ahead and what the risks were of that path and make a conscious decision as to whether you want to stay on that runway and path for the foreseeable future or not.
1894
And if you see the opportunity, there's tremendous advantage in accrual of value.
1895
And if you see your way clear, it's not going to be that easy to find another venture and you'll pay tax and have less to invest and so forth.
1896
So I guess I was subtly in favor of, but not strongly in favor.
1897
I was just in favor of analyzing the situation and not just taking a price that would have been an amazing return, although over a very short period of time.
1898
As Kevin and Jim describe it, that was a very healthy conversation.
1899
And ultimately, of course, that perspective prevailed.
1900
And shortly thereafter, there came an opportunity to buy Merrimack, which really had the potential to transform the business beyond just roadside assistance.
1901
But again, that was, as I understand it, something that was not unanimously supported at the board level.
1902
Do you remember that transaction and how that all unfolded?
1903
My recollection is that they had already built insurance into their offering to customers.
1904
They simply contracted for that insurance with an existing company.
1905
And they felt that the premiums being paid were higher than necessary for the risk that was being taken.
1906
So then they had a chance to acquire what would become a captive insurance company.
1907
And I remember some board members saying that's a bad idea because you'll be valued an insurance company if you own an insurance company.
1908
And that's a totally different valuation metric than you're hoping for.
1909
But I think the perception of Kevin and Jim, certainly, that some of us supported was that we're not turning ourselves into an insurance company.
1910
We need an insurer.
1911
And it would be better not to have to pay the stepped-up value to an outside insurer if we have an opportunity to attractively acquire a small-sized company.
1912
And the company, of course, did that.
1913
That was a launch pad moment.
1914
If you go back and look at the old board decks, which for this podcast I've done, you see in those early days before TA got involved, in the pure search period, you see this very consistent pattern of the company hitting revenue and subcount targets, which are very aggressive, but generally falling short.
1915
Some years quite a bit short of EBITDA targets.
1916
EBITDA, of course, growing very nicely, but not necessarily on budget.
1917
And talking to Kevin and Jim, it seems that was a reflection of how they were allocating their time.
1918
Even with some of this operational messiness, Kevin and Jim were miles ahead of the original forecast they had used to raise the capital.
1919
In their original base case, Kevin and Jim expected revenue to grow from $8.5 million when they bought the company in 1995 to $15 million in 2000, a compound annual growth rate of 12%.
1920
In reality, revenue grew from $8.5 million to $52 million, a compound growth rate of 43%.
1921
And EBITDA grew from $1.2 million to over $25 million, a compound growth rate of over 84%.
1922
At this point, Kevin and Jim want to take some chips off the table and end up selling 28.5% of the business to TA Associates.
1923
What do you remember from that transaction and how it evolved?
1924
Jeff Chambers, I had known before that.
1925
He was the lead person for TA.
1926
I don't believe there was any major price negotiation.
1927
I think that there had been a price established and maybe agreed to, but some additional conditions were requested on the part of TA.
1928
And I think over time, as they were resisted by management, TA came around and decided to invest on the same terms as the rest of the equity instead of having some preferential terms.
1929
Jeff joined the board, of course, and was invaluable over the next few years.
1930
That's exactly right.
1931
And I believe the terms piece in which they had no preferred security, no special governance rights, was highly unusual for TA at the time.
1932
Quite clearly, Irv attributed to your involvement, I will say, but a very good outcome for the existing shareholders for sure.
1933
At Continental, we had had an original involvement with TA many years prior to that, but obviously not with Jeff Chambers.
1934
So maybe some of that was in the deep background, but I don't remember specific conversations in which I was involved at all.
1935
So I can't imagine that I was anything other than a validator for the company.
1936
Maybe this is a good time to talk a little bit about the building of the team at Assurion right around the time of the TA transaction.
1937
Do you mind talking a little bit about that?
1938
It had become clear that with Jim Ellis's departure a couple years earlier in the late 90s, I think, it became clear that the rate that they're growing at, they were really thin at the top level, despite Kevin's enormous talents and his energy level and his good judgment.
1939
They needed more help at the top.
1940
And part of that was operational, but part of that was also recruiting.
1941
So it seemed to me there were two significant shortfalls, both arising from a lack of top management breadth.
1942, it's a unique thing as you look back on it.
1943, for Kevin, being able to transition between partnerships at the highest level relatively seamlessly and effectively.
1944
So obviously starting with Jim, his original partner, co-founder, and then evolving pretty quickly to a similar relationship with Brett.
1945
Is that a fair assessment?
1946
Yeah, and it's continued on in current years as well.
1947
Kevin's amazingly skillful along many dimensions, but certainly one of them is he's the best conflict avoider.
1948
He knows where he wants the company to go, but it's this is my view from outside, is that he's very graceful in his assertions and very respectful of other people he's working with.
1949
And there's no top-down sense, although it's clear that Kevin's in charge and has the tiller firmly in his hand and is directing the direction of the company.
1950
It's all done in a very elegant fashion.
1951
And that's really stood him in wonderful stead.
1952
And it's a quality that a lot of people don't have.
1953
Irv, as you look at Assurion and you compare it to other companies you've been involved with from a culture management, talent attraction, talent building perspective, how would you compare Assurian to other companies more generally?
1954
What dimensions does it stand out on in your mind?
1955
Well, they say one of the hardest jobs of great managers is to terminate ahead of the curve.
1956
It's hard enough to hire ahead of the curve, but it's really hard to terminate ahead of the curve.
1957
In terms of the managers they hired, they were unafraid to say they had made a mistake.
1958
That's a very subtle point, and it's not talked about in management literature to any degree that I've seen.
1959
Not that I'm a comprehensive reader of management literature because I'm not.
1960
People just don't talk about it.
1961
And the reason is obvious, which is it's unpleasant.
1962
Who wants to talk about letting somebody else go?
1963
But it's so essential.
1964
The biggest thing that stands out at me is the absence of dead wood at Assurion versus other companies where managers are inclined to be kinder to people in the sense and reposition them elsewhere.
1965
And, that's how fat builds up in companies.
1966
And blocking the line between being careful about this and being ruthless is not that easy.
1967
But they found a way to not be ruthless, but to really make performance-oriented decisions, coach where they could, but then not spend time working on what they consider to be lost causes.
1968
And that's probably the single biggest difference I see in their management style.
1969
Do you mind talking a little bit about Brett as a member of the team and CEO and his role in building the company?
1970
Yeah, I don't have a real inside look as to how he and Kevin divided things up and how they work together.
1971
I know that the chemistry and mutual respect between them is very deep.
1972
It remains to the present day, despite changing roles.
1973
They're both really smart.
1974
They work hard.
1975
They're honest.
1976
They have low egos and they have different skills to some degree.
1977
I think Kevin is a little bit broader brush, and Brett is perhaps just a little bit more detail-oriented, which doesn't suggest at all that he doesn't have an enormous intellect because Brett does have an enormous intellect.
1978
It has nothing to do with intellectual capability.
1979
It has to do with orientation and how you think about things and how much of your time you spend on broad gauge issues, strategic issues, financing issues, as opposed to how do you make the trains run on time.
1980
And Brett had a special talent for attracting people who could get the trains to run on time.
1981
I might skip for a minute to capital allocation.
1982
I was going to talk about the company's share repurchases.
1983
And I think your fingerprints may be on this.
1984
But one of the interesting things about the early days of the company is that it made two share repurchases early on.
1985
The first in 1999, so before TA got involved, when it bought in 10% of total shares outstanding,, leveraged financed buyback.
1986
And then secondly, once TA was on board, they did a second buyback in 2004 of a little over 6%.
1987
The returns from those two buybacks, by the way, are just extraordinary.
1988, the first one is 41% over 20-plus years.
1989
The second one is over 50% over,, almost 20 years.
1990
But can you talk a little bit about repurchasing shares in private companies, which is something that you guys did at Continental over the years?
1991
And it's pretty unusual, but something that has been part of Assurians playbook from early on.
1992
Yeah, we did it at Continental because both Amos and I thought it was a good place to invest.
1993
We had some free capital that was generated from time to time.
1994
And we thought, well, we want to for sure invest it in the land grab, to use your phrase earlier in a different context, because the cable business was indeed a land grab for a long period of time.
1995
But we also want to invest it in our own company.
1996
And it served two purposes: one to allow us to put capital to work, and the other to offer liquidity to people who wanted it.
1997
And it was, of course, optional.
1998
People could take us up on the opportunity or not.
1999
And we tried to price it as fairly as we possibly could at Continental.
2000
Well, that point of view, I'm sure, bled over into my conversations with Kevin because I think it's attractive.
2001
And by the way, back at Continental for one second, one of our major institutional investors was unalterably opposed to having us repurchase shares.
2002
And we had a terrible time convincing that person that it was a good use of capital.
2003
No, you should be expanding.
2004
Look at all the opportunity and so forth.
2005
So one of those investors wasn't thrilled with what we did.
2006
But even then, being 2001 and thereafter, seemed to be a very attractive use of any free capital you could scrape up because who wouldn't want to invest in Assurian at that time, at least that was my point of view, with all of the opportunity that lay ahead for them and the quality of their management.
2007
And it just seemed they were in a real sweet spot.
2008
Would you mind Irv talking a little bit about the Lockline deal and how that came about?
2009
And that one you were very specifically involved in.
2010
This Kevin tells us the story with Dick Floor.
2011
Would you mind talking a little bit about that?
2012
Kevin and Brett were talking about Lockline and then nothing happened.
2013
And then it would come up a year or so later and nothing happened.
2014
And it seemed to me it was a few years that they had wanted to acquire Lockline and had been unable to.
2015
And then what I remember is that they came to a board meeting in whenever it was, and they said, we just can't connect with this guy.
2016
He's impossible.
2017
We haven't been able to do any good at all.
2018
So, I think I remember going to Kevin after the board meeting and saying, Do you want me to take a crack at this guy whom I didn't know?
2019
He lived in Kansas City, was running a small to medium-sized public company of which Lockline was a part.
2020
Kevin said, Well, sure, go ahead.
2021
And I said, Well, if I'm going to do that, I'm going to drag my friend Dick Floor, who's just an unbelievable individual.
2022
I want to go out there with him because one of my great talents is getting out of the way of smart people.
2023
And I knew that if I went out there with Dick Floor, that I wouldn't have to talk too much.
2024
Would you mind doing just a quick summary on Dick Floor?
2025
Dick Floor and Bill Egan are both alums of the same college.
2026
Dick Floor went to Harvard Law School.
2027
He was a partner of Sullivan and Worcester in Boston.
2028
And he had one of the best minds of anybody I've ever come across.
2029
He was absolutely brilliant.
2030
Yet he was the most pleasant, self-effacing, practical, easygoing person in the world.
2031
So Dick and I went out to Kansas City, and we made an appointment with the fellow who was head of the parent company of Lockline.
2032
And Dick proceeded to charm this person, absolutely charm him.
2033
It turns out the person who was the CEO was a Horton graduate.
2034
Dick knew a bunch of people from Wharton.
2035
Dick found ways to establish connections with him, and he started out grumpy and ended up smiling.
2036
And I think that might have been the first time he'd smiled in quite some time.
2037
And that began a process which resulted a few months later in this person agreeing to a deal in principle, not fully signed, but to a term sheet, as I recall, which was attractive for Assurion.
2038
And I had picked up the ball from that first meeting and started working with the guy along with Dick.
2039
And we were trying to work on general terms.
2040
And I would check with Kevin and then I would talk to this guy.
2041
I remember in my infinite wisdom saying to Kevin before they closed, Are you sure you want to be in business with this guy?
2042
He was a dangerous cocktail of smart and nasty to my eye.
2043
Not overtly nasty, but just sharp.
2044
Smart as a whip, though, and just not the director they had.
2045
And he and his CFO were going to join Ashurian as board members.
2046
And I said, Kevin, you should obviously do what you want to do.
2047
I'm just wondering, these people are really tough apples.
2048
Kevin said, I know, we'll just have to live with them.
2049
And of course, that was a great decision.
2050
I'm not sure what decision I would have made, but I did have reservations having dealt with the guy over a period of a few months, as I remember.
2051
It's funny, as you mentioned that, or Kevin tells a story about how late in the negotiations there that CEO came back and said, we need our team to be able to stay in Kansas City.
2052, at the very 11th hour, which of course directly affected some of the economies and so forth that we were going to get by combining the do you remember that piece of it?
2053
I remember last-minute demands.
2054
I didn't remember what they were.
2055
I do remember one funny story about them, which is the first board meeting that they came to at Ashurian.
2056
I try to be early to meetings, but it seems to me this meeting, I was maybe barely on time or a minute or two late or something.
2057
And here were all the legacy Assurian board members sitting on one side and both ends of a table, big oval table.
2058
And here were these two guys over on the side by themselves, getting settled in their chairs.
2059
And I walked in and I thought, oh, this is really awkward.
2060
So I asked them if I could sit between them.
2061
I did.
2062
And I just felt that there was a chill to begin with in the very first board meeting, which we really didn't want.
2063
And I don't mean that in a self-laudatory way, but I have a distinct recollection that I sat between them at the first board meeting.
2064
Broke the ice a little bit.
2065
Yeah.
2066
Yeah.
2067
Interesting.
2068
That transaction was large.
2069
The total consideration was about 50% of the company's enterprise value beforehand.
2070
Fortunately, it was wildly accretive being able to combine those two operations and really grow that business.
2071
A $408 million valuation paid is less than half the EBITDA that Assurion now enjoys from that book of business.
2072
So definitely worth doing.
2073
And not too much after that, there was the 2007 transaction, which I think TA was driving.
2074
They wanted some liquidity.
2075
They'd been in it six years or so, mid-2007.
2076
And it's the dawn of the private equity group getting involved.
2077
The timing was extraordinarily good.
2078
That was a bull time in the market.
2079
Kevin credits you for being absolutely right about that timing and optimizing around it.
2080
Do you remember that transaction and how it unfolded, and maybe specifically the piece that allowed the company to end up without a dominant single private equity owner, which, of course, is unusual in a transaction that?
2081
I don't.
2082
And I appreciate Kevin's compliment, but I have no recollection of being market prescient.
2083
He's very clear on that, by the way.
2084
How can anybody be market prescient?
2085
Well, what I remember about that is maybe not all, how many was it four or five who came in?
2086
Three major ones and maybe a fourth.
2087
I remember them separately wanting to talk with me and Kevin saying, will you meet with XYZ?
2088
Well, sure, of course, I'd be glad to.
2089
And they said, well, what's going on in this company, anyway?
2090
It's been private for a long time.
2091
When's it going to be public?
2092
How are we going to get out?
2093
The valuations are pretty rich.
2094
We're buying from an informed seller.
2095
I said, I don't know.
2096
I think they have runway ahead.
2097
They've got great management.
2098
They said, Are you selling?
2099
And I said, No, I'm not selling.
2100
And that was at the center of it.
2101
If I wasn't going to be there, it wasn't because of me.
2102
It was because of the signal that unloading a bunch of my stock would have sent.
2103
Maybe this is a good time to revisit the board topic, right?
2104
Because obviously, after that transaction, board changes pretty significantly.
2105
The private equity owners are front and center in that.
2106
Can you talk a little bit about board effectiveness since that time and maybe how you'd compare the very different board groups?
2107
Well, you referred a couple of minutes ago to the fact that there was no one dominant investor.
2108
However, my impression is that they do act as a group on occasion, and they're loosely referred to at Assurion as the sponsors.
2109
And the players in the sponsor group do change over time.
2110
But I wouldn't say it's just people with a series of minority investments.
2111
There is a coordination among them.
2112
They do confer fairly regularly.
2113
I would say it straddles the line between having sold control and not having sold control.
2114
I think there are times when, to my eye, they seem to exercise their collective power, and other times when they didn't.
2115
They're all high-quality entities over the years and have all done well.
2116
And I remember having a conversation with Kevin at the time, just prior to the closing, and said, wow,, you're selling 55% to this group of people, and there have to be some changes, and their agendas and yours won't always match.
2117
He said, yeah, I know, I understand.
2118
I think this is the right thing to do.
2119
Now, back to your original question, how the board dynamics changed.
2120
My perception since that time in the last 16 years or so, is that there's a leader of that group of people, that loose confederation of people.
2121
It happens to be CPP now because they're the largest shareholder.
2122
But there's a presence there from people who all came in at the same time and all were acquainted with each other and bought the same security at the same price.
2123
So it used to be people sitting around the table with no control, just the control that management had by dint of its execution and all of the value it had created.
2124
Since then, I think there's a little bit more evidence of the respective agendas of the sponsors that is present in board conversations.
2125
And if you looked just at value creation, help to management on the part of the boards, and you were going to compare those two groups, the initial group, which I would say would include Jeff Chambers, and the post-07 group.
2126
Again, with the lens of who can be most helpful to management in building a company, how would you compare those two?
2127
So I'll try to do that, but I would say at the outset that in a way it's an unfair comparison because management needed more help before 2007 than they did after.
2128
The main way in which the sponsors have been helpful is the contacts that they have as a group and the collective experience they bring as a result of having invested in so many companies.
2129
The contacts are unalloyed benefits, no question that they know somebody somewhere almost whenever you need or wherever you need them.
2130
The part about the advisory, I do see differing agendas at play from time to time.
2131
There is an inherent conflict of interest between serving one's own shareholders and serving the shareholders of the company on whose board you sit.
2132
And I do see those conflicting agendas at play fairly often.
2133
And I see sometimes that decisions are made in favor of one's own agenda.
2134
An example of that is I heard a comment during a board meeting some years ago from one of those sponsors or institutional investors to the effect of, gosh, we really don't want you to branch over into that area.
2135
We have enough investment in that area.
2136
We think of you as an XYZ company, and we want you to stay there and keep doing what you're doing.
2137
You're doing a great job.
2138
I found that difficult.
2139
I think that just is the cost of doing business with them.
2140
There's nothing improper about it.
2141
There's nothing hidden or nefarious in any way.
2142
They're quality people and smart and they're all successful.
2143
But sometimes the best interests of a Shurian are not always served in those conversations.
2144
Very interesting.
2145
Okay, I'm going to shift topics if that's okay.
2146
Would you mind talking a little bit about how you thought about managing your own investment in the company over time across the series of transactions?
2147
It's the same advice I gave them when they were thinking of selling for $75 million or whatever the number was in the beginning.
2148
If you see a runway ahead and you feel okay about the risks, why not stay and play?
2149
And it was a concentration for me, but it was a tolerable concentration.
2150
And since I'm opportunistic by nature, I thought there was a lot more bread to bake.
2151
And I was disinclined to be a seller despite the various opportunities.
2152
I admire Kevin tremendously, and the job he's done has been off the charts, as you have said.
2153
And I was thrilled to be an investor and along for the ride and grateful that I was lucky enough to be there.
2154, despite my own fecklessness in the beginning, I got lucky and they decided to allow me in under the tent and lucky me.
2155
So shut up and be a good person and try to contribute.
2156
And by the way, who wants to sell?
2157
What am I going to do with the capital?
2158
Pay a big tax on it and then figure out what to do with it next.
2159
And it probably won't be as good as Assurian.
2160
Two more questions, Earth.
2161
They're both a little bit wider ranging.
2162
At a high level, are there any lessons you'd pull out of Kevin's experience running Assurian?
2163
The Assurian team were generally for future CEOs, aspiring CEOs.
2164
Nothing compares to winning from the high road.
2165
And that's what they've done.
2166
They've stuck with very high ethical standards.
2167
They hire smart people.
2168
They make changes where necessary.
2169
They treat their people generously.
2170
They treat their customers with respect.
2171
And everybody that I've ever seen Kevin interact with, he's treated with respect.
2172
Another is you can't overpay for good management.
2173
There's no such thing.
2174
You also can't overpay for a great acquisition, which they worry a little bit about with Lockline.
2175
But it had such a growth trajectory and was so accretive that who even remembers the price unless you're looking back at the records.
2176
And I think that's true as well.
2177
You can't overpay for good management.
2178
You can't overpay for a great company.
2179
I think a mistake that a lot of us make is: oh boy, that price, price for that, whatever it is, that's just too much.
2180
I can't bring myself to spend that much money.
2181
Of course, the way to look at it is not today, but it's tomorrow.
2182
And tomorrow, do I really know whether I spent 15% more or not to buy something great?
2183
So that's certainly one of the takeaways.
2184
Okay, my last question: I'm going to return to a topic we hit earlier.
2185
So, or if you've been involved in two companies that were participating in exceptionally fast-moving streams in Continental and Assurion, how would you, at a high level, compare those two companies?
2186
Well, the similarities are both companies had borrowers' personalities and weren't afraid to use aggressive leverage techniques against a predictable background.
2187
By leveraging up, you're not taking nearly so much risk as you are with a more volatile underlying PL.
2188
That's certainly one.
2189
Another similarity is trying to attract and retain top talent.
2190
It took us a while to wake up to that.
2191
We hired bottom talent for a while and paid dearly for it because the mistakes we made in getting that company started are too numerous to mention.
2192, the first key engineering person we hired was not satisfactory.
2193
We turned on our first systems and we had to turn them off for three weeks.
2194
Customers were supposedly paying, and we said, Whoops, we have some more work to do on our system.
2195
And we thought it was going to be a few days.
2196
It was three weeks.
2197
And that was all because the person we hired was a very bad choice.
2198
We were both in our late 20s, or I was 30 by then.
2199
And it was just bad judgment.
2200
Should have known better, but didn't.
2201
And one of the things that both companies did do in its later years is try to attract and retain top talent and be willing to pay them in terms of both equity and current comp in ways that made it hard for them to leave.
2202
Ways in which the companies are different is that Assurion is far larger, 21,000 employees now.
2203
We had, I don't know, very few thousand employees when the company was sold after 30 years, 32 years.
2204
It was sold in 1996.
2205
So, in a sense, we were much more capital-intensive.
2206
That also is something to watch out for if you're an MBA student, you're told.
2207
But there are times it's a good thing because it served to the structure of the industry being capital-intensive, made it an unregulated monopoly in effect.
2208
And if you could raise the capital, which we were able to do, you enjoyed some of the benefits of no competition.
2209
I guess other things were we guarded our ability to make decisions very carefully.
2210
That's why I was concerned about the 55% ownership.
2211
I don't think that's affected Assurion in a major way, but at the fringes, it has had an impact.
2212
And Amos and I, together for the first 16 years, and then Amos alone for the last 16 years, running that company.
2213
We're able to run it the way we wanted to run it, making the judgments that we wanted to make within reason.
2214, we didn't have people with other agendas.
2215
We had people questioning the decision-making and the strategy, which they should as board members, but not with other agendas.
2216
The iron filings were all closely aligned.
2217
That's not currently true with Assurion, but, Assurian has so far exceeded Continental's performance that they must be doing an awful lot of things right.
2218
All right.
2219
Well, Irv, thank you so much for taking the time to do this.
2220
It's wonderful to see you and very fun conversation.
2221
Thanks very much.
2222
Will, thank you very much for including me.
2223
I'm very flattered, and I'm thrilled that you're doing this.
2224
I know a lot of people will benefit.
