1
Most of us think we're self-aware.
2
We're reflective, curious.
3
We pride ourselves on being honest.
4
But the truth is, under pressure, when we feel threatened or misunderstood, we react.
5
We get defensive.
6
We withdraw.
7
We try to prove.
8
We go unconscious.
9
And often, we don't even realize it's happening.
10
We call it leadership.
11
We call it decisiveness.
12
But most of the time, we're just running old patterns.
13
That's why I'm so grateful to have this conversation with Diana Chapman.
14
Her work has changed how I think about responsibility.
15
She's the co-founder of the Conscious Leadership Group and co-author of the 15 commitments of conscious leadership.
16
But what's always stayed with me is how direct and grounded she is.
17
She helps you see what you're doing, how it's not working, and what might be possible if you stop trying to manage everything and start telling the truth.
18
So today's conversation is about waking up at work, at home, in our hearts.
19
Shall we begin, Diana?
20
Yeah, wonderful.
21
That was my favorite introduction I've ever had.
22, you've worked with high-performing leaders across industries.
23
What unconscious pattern shows up most often, especially when things go sideways?
24
I think mainly just that there is a mind that will start to want to prove it's right.
25
And there's so many topics about what that might look.
26
We need to go direction A versus direction B, or you're not pulling your weight, or you're not as effective as I think you ought to be, or this team should be as motivated as this team.
27
There's just always a mind over there that's looking to prove how it's right.
28
And every time that happens, there's suffering.
29
One of the most powerful frames in your work is this idea of being above the line or below the line.
30
Can you walk us through what that means and how do we begin to recognize where we are as it relates to the example you shared as well?
31
Yeah, sure.
32
So, I this model so much.
33
The simple line, and the idea is that in any given moment, we're bouncing, and it is really bouncing.
34
We're bouncing back and forth.
35
So, when we're above the line, it's just this place of, oh, wow, here I am.
36
I'm here with you.
37
I'm curious, what are we going to get to explore here?
38
How will this get passed out into the world?
39
I just want to learn.
40
I am curious.
41
I even have a lightheartedness about me.
42
There's no problem here with a capital P.
43
There's no identity here in reactivity trying to prove itself.
44
That's an above-the-line mindset.
45
When I'm below the line, it gets scared.
46
Some part of my identity gets scared.
47
It might say, oh no, are people going to me here?
48
Is this going to go anywhere valuable?
49
I'm a little nervous.
50
I want to prove I'm good.
51
There's something feels a little serious here.
52
I'm not as available to learn.
53
I'm more trying to get something right with a capital R.
54
So that human beings are constantly in reactivity.
55
We're wired to do that.
56
We're wired to go below the line.
57
It is not bad or wrong.
58
In fact, after 30 years of practice, I don't really get a sense that I have much control over how often I go below the line.
59
What I do have control over is quickly noticing it and shifting myself back up above the line if I choose to.
60
How do you do that?
61
So many ways.
62
We wrote the 15 commitments because I wanted to map out.
63
Here are 15 unique ways you can start to take yourself above a line.
64
So the first one is blame is not going to help you get above a line.
65
So claim.
66
Claim, don't blame.
67
So how am I the creator of this thing I'm complaining about?
68
That's one fabulous way to shift yourself.
69
Another one, as I mentioned before, is let go of being right and see how you can see another perspective.
70
And another really big one is feel your feelings.
71
A lot of us are in drama because I don't want to feel my feelings.
72
And specifically, I don't want to feel that sensation in my body.
73
I don't want to feel my stomach swirl.
74
I don't want to feel that ache in my chest.
75
I don't want to feel that heat up my neck and my jaw tighten.
76
I'm uncomfortable with those feelings.
77
So then I'm those sensations and then I'm uncomfortable with the feelings associated.
78
So I'll get into some drama to try to manage and control that.
79
Let's talk about that a little bit more, right?
80
So victim, villain, and hero.
81
Why do these rules feel so familiar?
82
Victim, villain, and hero are three ways that we all get caught in victimhood.
83
And when you are below the line, it feels life is happening to me.
84
When I'm above a line, life is happening by me.
85
So when I'm in a to me mindset, I'm in a victimhood mindset.
86
And there are these three unique flavors of victim.
87
The victimhood, should I say, the pure victim is, it's hard.
88
I'm trying.
89
And we this role because we don't have to take responsibility here.
90
It's not my fault.
91
It's their fault.
92
Look what's happening.
93
I don't have anything to do with it.
94
And so that's a big payoff: not having to really take ownership.
95
The villain's role is to blame.
96
It's,, you.
97
You're the reason why.
98
It's another way I don't have to take full ownership or me.
99
Now I'm going to take all the ownership.
100
And often I'll do that because I don't having to feel my anger and get into a conflict with you.
101
So maybe I'll just take it all on myself.
102
And then hero, the hero's job is to seek temporary relief.
103
And we do that because it does relieve some of these emotional pains that we don't want to be in.
104
And so that feels better.
105
I'd rather work extra hard and take over than have to have the difficult conversation.
106
And we typically have one of those three that we spend more time in, do you think?
107
And we typically circulate through them as well, at various points in the day, even.
108
I think everybody's in all three roles all day long.
109
And I think we all have a unique, I call it a dance, of how we get into the drama triangle.
110
So based on our childhoods and what roles we played there in our family systems, some of us, I play the hero probably more than the other two, but I still play the other two quite a bit.
111
And when anybody says, oh, I'm not that one, I'm these other two, but I'm not that one.
112
I'm always, oh, it's just hidden.
113
But, that one's there quite a bit.
114
So how can we begin to step out of them?
115
Well, I'm a big fan of this concept that what you resist persists.
116
Or if you can't accept it, you can't shift it.
117
You cannot shift that which you cannot accept.
118
So the first thing to do when you're in the drama triangle is to notice yourself and just let it be, okay, oh, I'm a victim right now.
119
Oh, I'm critical.
120
I'm villainizing right now.
121
Oh, I'm a hero.
122
And can I not make that a problem?
123
It's just a personality scared.
124
That's all that's going on.
125
And so can I just accept this scared part of me, not make it good or bad?
126
And I to exaggerate my heroes and villains and victims and make them funny because there's no way you're going to have transformation if this is serious and if this is a problem.
127
It's just not going to work.
128
I've never seen it work.
129
So can you start to play with and welcome and have a lighthearted attitude toward your own reactivity?
130
And then from there and exaggerate a little bit to get it even a little more funny.
131
So then you can start to help it relax.
132, I've noticed how quickly I move from what happened to the story I'm telling about what happened.
133
And you teach,, that much of our drama comes from our unowned projections.
134
That the real source of frustration might be us.
135
Yes.
136
I was coaching an executive the other day and she was just still super reactive about the fact that her teenage son had gotten in a car accident the day before and he's fine and the car has some damage.
137
But she was just so reactive.
138
And so I had her just recognize, come back and just tell me the facts.
139
Imagine you're a newspaper reporter and you're just going to just tell me what happened.
140
So young man hit garbage dumpster, airbags deployed, man had small injury on hand, man is fine, walked away, man is home now.
141
That's it.
142
So I asked her, if you just look at this as the facts without any of your interpretation and stories, how are you?
143
And she was, oh, okay, that's really helpful.
144
I'm back just in presence with just letting life be as it is.
145
And the reactivity came from this was terrible.
146
I should have known.
147
This,, all of the stories that her mind wanted to be right about caused a system to get into reactivity.
148
So separating out facts, what are the actual facts?
149
What the camera record if there are no adjectives and adverbs, comparisons, just the facts.
150
When we are triggered or in conflict, how do we begin taking full responsibility for our experience without collapsing into blame, guilt, or self-judgment?
151
Okay.
152
One of my favorite exercises I do with clients is I say, okay, what is the thing you're complaining about?
153
And let's just say, my executive team is having banter between a few of them, and I'm really frustrated about it.
154
And I say, okay, let's pretend this isn't happening to you, which it's not, that it's happening by you.
155
And let's pretend that I want to create the exact same issue you have.
156
I want my executive team bantering the way yours is, especially between two or three of them yours is.
157
Teach me how to create that issue and keep it going the way you do.
158
And I've never met anybody, even if this was the very first thing we ever spoke about, who can't go, all right, I think I can see how,, how I am starting to create this.
159
And then they put a list together.
160
Here are the five, seven steps that you can take to go create an executive team that keeps having conflict inside of itself.
161
And so then they've written those five or seven steps down.
162
And then the good news is they don't need me really or anybody else.
163
They just start doing the opposite of everything they just wrote down and the issue resolves.
164
So that's one of my favorite things is go look at how you're creating it and then you can see how to create it differently.
165
There is a moment in your work when you invite someone to ask, am I willing to shift?
166
And that word willing is such a pivot point.
167 why is that question so essential?
168
Yeah, because so many of us want to be different or do things differently.
169
I always say,, I often want to weigh less.
170
And am I willing to weigh less?
171
Not a lot.
172
So I have my pants a little tighter than I might prefer.
173
And that's because I still want my delicious next extra course that I want more than I'm, and I'm not willing yet to have the discipline to create a lower weight.
174
And that's true for a lot of us.
175
And I use weight because most everybody has something they want different about their bodies.
176
I want it firmer.
177
I want it thinner.
178
I want less body fat.
179
I want more body fat.
180
I want something different to happen.
181
And so, but most of us aren't willing to really truly do what's required.
182
And so, willing is a very powerful question: Are you willing?
183
And for most of us, 80% of the time, the answer is no, because being willing is going to create something that's going to feel scary or feel threatening.
184
And so,, I can feel the part of me that gets threatened if I feel I have to curb my diet in certain ways.
185
It feels I'm going to lose freedom, I'm going to lose fun, I'm going to lose joy, and so that feels a threat.
186
So, I'm not yet willing.
187
And even you go back to the earlier point that you made about this idea of a shift from just to me to for me, it's not just semantics, it's a doorway to a different life.
188
And how do we begin to live from that mindset?
189
Great.
190
So, you spoke about for me.
191
So, here's how I see it: there's one option, which is life is happening to me.
192
Hey, I have to tolerate all this stuff.
193
I'm at the effect of it.
194
I'm at the effect of whatever.
195
Then, if I come above the line, I have the option first to say, Oh, life is happening by me.
196
I'm the creator of my reactivity and upset, and what's not going well.
197
And then you're speaking to another possibility above the line, which is life is happening for me.
198
Now, this is an option because what you could do is you could say, What if everything is here for my learning and growth?
199
What if everything is an invitation back to love?
200
What if everything is trying to walk me home back to the truth of myself?
201
So, I love living that way and it doesn't suggest that it's true with a capital T that everything's for me it's a choice I get to make if I really want to learn and grow And I find this framework so useful even in investing because if you think about the drama triangle, you can have investors that feel a victim to the Fed.
202
The market's gone down because the Fed did something.
203
So they're the effect of the market and they made, they feel a victim because the Fed did something or they'll make Trump the villain because of Liberation Day, this happened.
204
Or they'll have a loss and they'll do a hero trade to make back losses or something of that sort.
205
So we can even cycle through those frameworks as an investor, which I find interesting.
206
And even when you think about above the line, below the line, you do not want to trade when you're below the line.
207
You don't want to fire off an email when you're below the line.
208
You don't want to have a negotiation with your boss when you're below the line.
209
So there's lots of interesting frameworks that apply to investing within this too.
210
Oh, it's a great question.
211
Yeah, I'm working with a lot of investors right now, and many of them are deeply below the line.
212
They're all very much in the unknown.
213
Things are changing a lot and they're scared.
214
And so to your point, when you're really threatened and scared, not a good time to make choices and have communications because you can count on them creating at least a little, if not a lot, of drama.
215
And drama is that wasted energy where you have to recycle things that instead of going out and doing cool things that permanently create what you most want.
216
So it's very important, I think, for investors these days to really go take a look at, oh yeah, I'm triggered, I'm reactive.
217
And let me just first notice that.
218
Just can I notice that?
219
And can I allow that?
220
Can I just welcome that I got scared?
221
And then let's see, am I willing to shift?
222
There's a bunch of different shift moves.
223
And if I am willing to shift, then what would be the next action step I would take to permanently solve this rather than spinning and recycling?
224
What are some of those shift moves?
225
Well, I mentioned earlier,, really taking responsibility for how am I creating the thing, including, how am I, how did I co-create Trump being here doing what he's doing?
226
I'm not at the effect of it.
227
I'm part of a whole culture that set that up.
228
And what was my part in that?
229
Let me take a look at that so that I can see, oh yeah, okay, I have something to do with the way things are.
230
Now, I don't have everything to do with it, but I have a part to play.
231
And when I can own that part, that really helps me relax, take responsibility, and then say, okay, now that I'm taking responsibility, I'm coming back into I'm the co-creator here of this whole scene.
232
And how do I want to respond?
233
What about just examining the question, is it true?
234
Is it true?
235
Yeah.
236
It's just one of my favorites, I think, which is the economy should be different than it is.
237
Is it true?
238
Can I absolutely know for sure that it's true?
239
I don't, I can't absolutely know anything for sure is true.
240
And if I think I do, I'm in trouble because I'm arguing with reality.
241
So it is the way it is.
242
And what happens when I let go of needing to be right?
243
The economy should be this way.
244
Well, I notice my whole nervous system relaxes.
245
I come back to deep presence.
246
And can I argue the other side?
247, let's argue why the economy should be this way.
248
One of the things I'm excited about is the economy being this way is really shaking us up to start to go, maybe there's new things we ought to be thinking about and doing now and letting go of old ways that didn't really work.
249
Is at least as true.
250
I'm not saying it's more true, but it's at least as true.
251
And so now I'm available for, yeah, the economy should be this way, it should be this way, are both true.
252
And then I get out of righteousness and then I come back to, well, it is what it is.
253
What can we learn?
254
How do I respond?
255
There are a few words that I've tried to train myself to become aware when I use them.
256
Should is one of them.
257 how the market should be leads to hypocrisy because it shouldn't be one way or another.
258
It just is.
259
Or if I just say people, it typically leads me to going down a path which is going to create some judgment about something.
260
And so just being mindful of certain words that can set off a trap is also helpful.
261
I love paying attention to whether I'm shitting on myself or on other people and really catching it.
262
So yeah, it's just, I highly recommend people take that out of their vocabulary.
263, at the retreat, Diana, many found your candor terrifying.
264
How can we practice radical honesty in a way that deepens connection rather than damages it?
265
Yeah,, my candor can be a little scary because, well, one, it's sometimes hard to hear and watch people tell just the truth about what's happening around us because it's uncomfortable.
266
So, some of us are so trying so hard not to be uncomfortable, physically uncomfortable, emotionally uncomfortable, even mentally uncomfortable.
267
And so that's threatening to a lot of us.
268
And so, how do we learn to let it be okay to be candid and let people be whatever they're going to be and be comfortable ourselves with that?
269
There's just, I think that is one of the biggest shadows of our culture is how much we're trying to control pain, period.
270
Tell us more.
271
Well, a lot of us don't want to acknowledge we're scared.
272
A lot of us don't want to acknowledge we're sad.
273
A lot of us don't want to acknowledge we're angry.
274
We don't want to acknowledge those things.
275
And we're trying to control that in ourselves.
276
We're trying to control that in others because it's going to require us to breathe and be with something that we don't to be with.
277
It's not as familiar or it's not as comfortable.
278
And we're pretty addicted to comfort.
279
We're a whole culture.
280
And I argue one of the reasons why I think globally, there's just been a global wake up of your comfort is not your friend.
281
And to the extent that you're unwilling to face your discomfort, we're going to set up a lot of conditions around you to force you to.
282
That is, yeah, that's that's quite something.
283
Yeah.
284
Yeah, yeah.
285
So, everybody is just, Can we all just stay in our friendly little boxes and everybody just get along and everything's just fine?
286
And no, no conflicts, and all, it's just there's this addiction to let's just all feel good, let's just all be happy and fine.
287
Everything's just good, and it's just, well, that shadow is going to be forced to come out one way or another.
288
And if you won't do it consciously, it'll show up unconsciously around you.
289
What about the shadowy parts within us?
290, how do we make sure we integrate those?
291
Right?
292
So, I say to all of my investor friends, you gotta own your shadow of greed.
293
It's really important.
294
And if you don't own the shadow of greed, it's gonna bite you one way or another eventually.
295
And there's nothing wrong with being greedy.
296
It's not necessarily good or bad, but it's important to own that you have quite a bit of greed, that you want more.
297
And that when you have more, then you still want more often.
298
And that's that can become an addiction to not letting yourself relax into this moment and recognize all you've ever wanted, all you've ever really wanted is already here.
299
But you're not here enough to receive it, and so you're caught up in greed trying to go get it.
300
Wow.
301
You just set up something that I found would be extremely helpful for the community because in the book, it's not just a book, it's a way of being.
302, there are three commitments that I think are especially important for the community.
303
One of them is scarcity, right?
304
This idea that we're always running out of time, money, energy, love.
305
You write, I commit to experiencing that I have enough of everything.
306
That feels so radical into this world.
307
Right.
308
So there's a couple of ways to be able to experience enough of everything.
309
One is imagine that you're going to put an invisible wall up to the past and a visual and an invisible wall to the future.
310 really let yourself imagine that and that you're just sitting right here.
311
No past, no future.
312
And so let's just try it right now.
313
It's you and me.
314
We're just two people talking to each other and there's no past, no future.
315
There's just right now.
316
And if we're just here right now, is there anything missing?
317
If you can't go into the past and you can't go into the future, can you find anything that you need and want that you don't have?
318
No.
319
No.
320
No.
321
It's so great because there we go.
322
I was going to say, your screen went black, and I was thinking about this part of me that was, wait, I need to see him.
323
And then I thought, I don't, he's right here.
324
He's right here with me.
325
So I don't need anything if I'm right here right now, but most of us are not here, not really.
326
And especially in your community, in me too, we're out in front.
327
We're out in front of the moment.
328
We're out here looking around for what is that?
329
What's the future?
330
What's this?
331
What's that?
332
It's exciting out here.
333
But the problem is that when you're out here and not here, you can't receive everything you've ever wanted.
334
So you're hungry, a hungry ghost that can never be filled.
335
So there's just this constant,, that's not quite, I don't quite have something.
336
And that's the source of scarcity.
337
Another thing that hit me hard was: I commit to being the source of my own approval, control, and security.
338
That's a tall order for anyone.
339
Where do most people first notice they're outsourcing their sense of worth?
340
And what does it look to reclaim that authority from within?
341
You're spot on.
342
That I think is one of the most difficult commitments of all.
343
And so, what is it if I could be the source of all the approval I have ever wanted?
344
What would that be?
345
My belief is one of the key pieces to being able to be that is to really learn to love and accept every aspect of me.
346
And one of my deep practices right now is to look for what I haven't either owned about me or accepted about me by looking at who I judge out in the world.
347
So anybody I'm judging is an indicator of a mirror.
348
There's a mirror out there being held up that points to what hasn't been owned or loved.
349
So I am doing my deep work these days because I can feel the judgment come up.
350
How can he do that?
351
What?
352
Why are they?
353
I can feel that that's not okay.
354
They're not, that's not good.
355
That's not, I'm not that, especially if you have the thought, I'm not that person.
356
Just count on that's something you haven't owned and loved.
357
And so once you can start to own and love both the beautiful the beautiful parts of you and the really there's some really awful parts of us as humans they're cruel they're they're not kind and that's just part of the system.
358
But when you can welcome all of that, all the approval you've ever wanted is inside of you.
359
And then go ahead.
360
Why is approval so important?
361
Everybody, everybody wants to be liked, loved, valued, respected.
362
It's so important.
363
We all, part of our happiness is about wanting to know that our service to you is valuable, that what we have is something that you want.
364
And so that approval is really important.
365
Yeah,, because it's been such a big part of my life.
366, my 20s was me seeking my approval of my dad.
367
30s was different.
368
Now in my 40s, I feel it's my wife now.
369
I told her this is your decade.
370
Yeah.
371
Yeah.
372
And so it's just about going, sweetheart, I'm really appreciating it.
373
Every judgment you have toward me is my deep work to go see if I can own and love that.
374
Thank you so much for judging me.
375
What a gift you're giving me.
376
Because I can feel all the resistance to what you, any part of the criticism that you give me, any of that resistance is just keeping me from being present.
377
And then my favorite thing is when I have those moments where I really feel all the approval within, when I can feel somebody doesn't approve of me, I just go, oh, that must be not so fun to be over there not seeing the truth of something over here.
378
That must not be so great for you because I can see the magnificence over here, even when it has shadows that are dark.
379
I love that.
380
Yeah, and then you and then you do because it's,, it's I think parents can think about this.
381 the beauty of your children and they do stuff that's stupid sometimes, but that doesn't keep you from knowing the truth of them.
382
So if somebody didn't see the beauty of your child, you would just think, you just don't know my child.
383
You don't see what I see.
384
And you would just think they're crazy.
385
So could you do that same thing for yourself?
386, I'm somebody's child.
387
I'm this beautiful being.
388
And if you can't see the magnificence of that one, well, you're just, you just don't see very well.
389
There's also an element where it's not just seeking approval, but letting it sink in.
390
Oh, yeah, right.
391
Because a lot of us were wired to not really let it sink in because if we just approved of ourselves, some people will say, Diana, if I approved of myself, I'm not sure I'd want to work anymore because I work and achieve just to get approval.
392, what would motivate me then?
393
And I go, it's a great question because almost everybody is motivated by threat to do things in the world.
394
We don't know what it's to be motivated by trust, by love, by freedom.
395
We don't know what that's.
396
So for many of us, it's scary to really take an appreciation and see our magnificence because I don't, I want to keep, I want my edge.
397, I hear people say that, I want my edge.
398
And I'm afraid if I don't have my edge, then,, what's going to happen?
399
What I hear you saying is basically there's a place where we can strive with contentment and from a place of love as opposed to feel you lack something.
400
Yeah, you just start to, somebody's going to want to get off the couch and do something.
401
Somebody's going to be inspired.
402
Somebody's going to be excited about making something in the world.
403
And even if it's,, making meals for your family or building a company, you're going to, you're going to want to play because that's what it's really about.
404
It's once you start to just relax into trust, then it's, I just want to play.
405
And what would be exciting to do?
406
You also invite people to stop settling for competence or even excellence and to live in the zone of genius.
407
What is that?
408
Yeah.
409
I'm heading out to New York soon to go talk to the Kaufman fellows about zone of genius.
410
And zone of genius is, it's the thing you were born for.
411
And, when you're in it, you're, I was born for this.
412
Time and space go away.
413
This is easy for me.
414
And it feels you enjoy it.
415
Even if it's difficult, it creates an incredible amount of contentment and gives you even a little energy.
416
And you're really good at it.
417
And there are many people for whom they don't go create a life in which they're spending at least 50, at least 50%, ideally 70% of their day in their zone of genius because they make up a story.
418
I can't make enough money doing that.
419
So I settled for my zone of excellence, which is these are things I am really good at.
420
I've developed them over time.
421
I may be studied to do them, but it takes energy to do those things.
422
You wouldn't see me do it on my own unless I'm probably getting paid or somebody appreciates me for it specifically.
423
Whereas zone of genius, I just do it for the sake of doing it.
424
And zone of confidence for sure.
425
If you're doing things where you, it's the last thing you want to do, get it off your plate.
426
You got to find a creative way to have somebody else support you for whom it's more in their zone of genius.
427
What keeps people stuck outside it?
428
Fear.
429
I'm scared.
430
And a righteous mind that goes, oh, I'm right that you can't make money that way.
431
Or I'm right that that's not going to work.
432
And I just go, life is really creative.
433
There's got to be a way.
434
Can you go imagine that there's one sliver of reality in which you could make all the money you need and want doing what you most love?
435
There's got to be, couldn't we agree?
436
There's got to be at least one potential in reality.
437
And if that's true, let's go find it.
438
And what changes once we do step into it?
439
Say it again.
440
What changes when we do step into it?
441
Oh my goodness.
442
You get so much of your aliveness back.
443
It's so fun.
444
It's,, it's so creative.
445
It's making love all day.
446
It's just, this is so satisfying to just be in my flow state all day and not have it drain me.
447
So then you get to come back home to be with your family.
448
You have energy for them, for your friends, for your hobbies.
449
It's not exhausting you and burning you out.
450
When I first discovered this framing, it really resonated with me and I made it a point to always want to live and work from a place of the zone of genius.
451
And I started using the terminology at home.
452
And one day, my wife was just tired in the evening in the kitchen, and she was loading the dishwasher.
453
And she's, Joad, I realize today that loading the dishwasher is not part of my zone of genius.
454
I'm done.
455
We've got to figure out something different here.
456
But yeah, it just really does change things in a massive way.
457
It allows you to take, at least for me, it allowed me to take a much bigger leap and grow in capacity and confidence.
458
Yeah.
459
And the other thing is, you are really good at your zone of genius and people are so grateful and you feel you're really contributing.
460
It's such a gift.
461
I think I refer the book, The Big Leap, by Gay Hendricks, that is about the zone of genius.
462
I refer that book more than any other book.
463
And I've never had a client who didn't say that was a worthy read.
464
So I tell people,, I think it's one of the keys to your living a beautiful life is spending more and more of your time in that zone.
465
What do you think about this idea of growing and expanding your identity?
466
Growing and expanding your identity.
467
What do you mean by that?
468
It's we feel we're capable of so much.
469
Let's say myself in my 20s, and we can't imagine more or think that there's even more possible.
470
And so there's this concept of self-sabotage that even Gay Hendrix talks about, right?
471
And then you get older and you realize you've got more skills and you're able to do more and give more.
472
But then you still limit yourself.
473
And then one by one, you let these beliefs and stories, you drop them to achieve a higher level.
474
And it almost requires birthing a new version of you every single time.
475
Yeah, what you're talking about, Gay calls in his book the upper limits problem.
476
Got something in my throat today.
477
So the upper limits problem is this idea that I'm only allowed to be so happy.
478
Somehow, in my identity, it feels it'll be a threat if I'm too much, if I'm too vital, too alive, too successful, too whatever.
479
There's this fear, a deep, deep fear.
480
It's not conscious for any of us.
481
But there's a story deep down in there that says things : if you get too alive and happy and vital, it might be a threat to your family of origin.
482
Either they might not want to be with you or you might not want to be with them.
483
Another deep story is: if I get too successful, too all these wonderful things, people might take me down.
484
Because look at the culture.
485
A lot of people to take down,, the most successful among us.
486
We to criticize them.
487
We have rag magazines for those kinds of things.
488
Another one is, I just don't deserve it.
489, a lot of people say, why me?
490
Look at all the people suffering.
491
Why should I have this?
492
And another one is, if I'm this successful, it's going to be a burden.
493, it's going to be a lot.
494
I could feel it.
495
I had that one come up the other day.
496
I was at a conference, the Wisdom 2.0 conference, and a lot of people wanted to come up and talk to me.
497
And I could start to feel, oh, part of me was, oh, I'm so grateful my work is getting out of the world and I'm getting a lot of attention.
498
But then another part of me was, I'm a little afraid of getting engulfed here.
499
This is a lot of energy I have to manage.
500
And it's feeling a bit a burden all of a sudden.
501
And so I could see that a sabotage starting to come up in myself around maybe I wouldn't want to be as successful because I might not want to deal with this.
502
So it's deep in us, and we all have to pay attention to how do you help build more and more capacity for life to go well.
503
There's a passage from the author Marion Williamson, which Mariana Williamson, which I love, and I'll read it because I think it's appropriate here.
504
And she says, Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.
505
Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.
506
It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us.
507
We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?
508, who are you not to be?
509
You are a child of God.
510
You're playing small does not serve the world.
511
There's nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you.
512
We are all meant to shine as children do.
513
We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us.
514
It's not in some of us, it's in everyone.
515
And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.
516
As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.
517
I have a partial part of that quote on my home.
518
I love that quote.
519
That was the quote that I wanted to read at the last day of the retreat.
520
Yeah, it's great.
521
And I do think part of shadow work, and this is, I think, interesting, is shadow just means anything that's not fully been revealed, right?
522
That's that's and so we have dark parts in the shadow, but we also have a lot of light parts that are in the shadow.
523
And that quote really points to that.
524
That,, wait, what?
525
I'm that, wait, I'm that?
526, I don't, is that, can I handle being that beautiful that much?
527
That it's just that's a that's a big edge for many of us.
528
And so, learning how to take an appreciation is we now know the research on what happens in a brain when you appreciate it is so cool.
529
And so, being around others who want to give and receive appreciation is such an important piece here in helping you grow your capacity for life to go well.
530
Where does guilt reside?
531
Guilt is in the mind that says it's right about something.
532
So, guilt is really just a story.
533
And if you unravel the story, the guilt goes away.
534
Now, there is a feeling underneath guilt that I believe is more around sorrow.
535
I'm sorry.
536
And I'm sorry, really means I'm sorrowful.
537
I feel heartbroken.
538
I feel an ache.
539
I feel the consequence of my actions, how it might have cost others.
540
And so, rather, guilt is just a judgment, but it feels less painful than sorrow.
541
So, I think a lot of people judge themselves to get away from the heartbreak.
542
Guilt is way easier for us.
543
Yeah, and sometimes guilt is also just on top of fear.
544
I'm just scared.
545
I don't know everything.
546
And,, I made a mistake.
547
And I'm scared about the fact that I'm vulnerable that way.
548
And that I'm,, I don't know a lot.
549
And I don't want to be with that fear.
550
So I'll guilt myself instead and say, I should have known.
551
I think for me, it's,, it comes down to when you look at all the suffering in the world and you look at the way you live your life, you're smiling because where this is going.
552, it gets overwhelming at times.
553
How do you balance joy and sorrow?
554
How can you maintain composure and continue to live, breathe, succeed, and do your best?
555
And at the same time, hold space for the sorrow you feel and the suffering.
556
And where's the responsibility there?
557
Yeah, well, first of all, I say everybody, slow down.
558
Especially in these communities that you're supporting, most everybody's moving way too fast.
559
It's hard to listen to presence when you're not able to listen because you're going too fast.
560
So one, slow down and breathe and be for a second.
561
And from that place, recognize you don't know so much.
562
So how are you going to make decisions if you don't know so much?
563
And I to really recognize I have four sources for making decisions.
564
IQ, EQ, BQ, body intelligence, and I would argue SQ, spiritual intelligence.
565
And that's that presence, whatever you want to call it, that has at that where you can have access to something beyond your own egoic knowing.
566
And these four centers of intelligence when you're slowed down enough to to talk with them to be with them are fantastic guides I have found myself leaning into SQ to help with those moments because I feel sometimes if we are to look at the world through our own lens, a lot of it will not make sense.
567
But when you apply, for example, a here-after perspective, as I to call it, if you start thinking about the events and situations from a here-after perspective, at least you can be at somewhat peace with it.
568
Yes, I to.
569
I was just with a group, a group of CEOs in Boston last week, and they each had their own major issue they were struggling with.
570
And so, and they were meaningful issues.
571
And these were, in this case, these were all men.
572
They were really beautiful, really caring.
573
I could just feel how much it mattered to them that they addressed these things.
574
But they were in reactivity about it because they were scared.
575
And so one of the things I did is I said, just for now, I want you to close your eyes and I want you to imagine that you're going to go float up into an all-black space.
576
And we're going to take your name away for now.
577
You don't have a name anymore.
578
You're just going to be up in that all-black space.
579
And I had them just rest into that and settle in.
580
And then at some point I said, I'd you now to open your eyes back up but stay connected to that place that you've been in, for you've been hanging out in for the last couple of minutes.
581
And they did.
582
And I just went to each one and I said, what do about how you want to address this thing you've brought up in the group?
583
And each man was so present and just said, I know that I shouldn't, that this is not the way what I was considering.
584
I know I need to go this way, not that way.
585
I go, How do?
586
They just go, It's just clear.
587
I don't know, I'm not right.
588
It's just something knows.
589
And they all loved that exercise of just as a simple way to go find what I would call a spiritual intelligence of just going into a nope, a place of nothingness, a vast open space where you come back to peace and then listen.
590
It's about listening in that place.
591
You don't have to know anything, you just hear.
592
And if you're present enough, it can be quite clear.
593, silence is the other difficult thing in this day and age, right?
594
What I find helps me is trying to align the heart, the mind, and the tongue.
595
And I think any conflict is when the mind is thinking something else and the heart's getting something else and you're saying something else.
596 one of the three or two out of the three are not in sync.
597
And I found for the longest time there were many versions of me out there.
598
And I realized I only want to be one jawad, and the only way to do that is to integrate all of them.
599
So that's just one person.
600
And so always speaking for a place where they all three are aligned, the heart, mind, and tongue.
601
And if there's any conflict, it's because one of those are absent.
602
And if I can't bring them into conflict, then it's silence and waiting.
603
Well, that's beautiful.
604
I love that.
605
I can feel your, you,, I can feel your practice because you're speaking it.
606
It's an embodied place you're speaking from as you talk about it.
607
Yeah.
608
And it's practice, right?
609
It takes practice over and over again.
610
And I also just think,, people want, everybody wants the quick fix,, where's my pill?
611
And same thing with personal development.
612, how do we,, what's the quick fix here?
613
But this, these are practices.
614
This is devotional work to learn to really unwind,, a society and a lineage of reactivity that you have downloaded.
615
And so,, it takes some time.
616
And so finding whatever practice works for each person, just, I would just say,, everybody goes to the gym who cares about their physical selves, but we don't go to the gym for our psychological selves.
617
And so what's your version of gym each day?
618
And there's so many ways to go to the gym in the psychological way.
619
And so everybody's job is just to tune into what way works for them.
620
What's one practice you personally return to when you notice yourself slipping below the line?
621
I return, one of my favorites is I do return to a questioning my mind.
622
I really the work of Byron Katie, and that move for me takes me back to a deep, deep presence.
623
That's probably one of my key ones.
624
And then the other one really is just coming back to, oh, you got scared, Diana.
625
Oh, sweetheart.
626
Okay, come on over here and be with that part of myself that's scared and welcome her.
627
Come sit on my lap and just breathe with that part of me that's scared so it gets accepted and then settles.
628
And then from there, I get that lineup back easily again.
629
It's interesting because at the retreat,, you and I, we spent some time going over some beliefs that I had as well that were getting in the way.
630
And I realized there were quite a few of those beliefs that were getting in the way.
631
And by the end of it, I realized, yeah, I need to let go.
632
And I was able to let go.
633
And part of that was also a very emotional experience for me, surprisingly, because by the end of it, the heaviest emotion I was feeling over the course of the week was grief.
634
And I wasn't expecting,, this is a retreat.
635
It was 30 people, all very close friends.
636
And I'm, why am I feeling grief?
637
And I realized I'm feeling grief because it was time to say goodbye to the jawat that got me here.
638
Yes.
639
And so just you talked about,, it's okay.
640
It was also just me saying,, thank you, but I've got it from here.
641
And he's going to show up from time to time, but I've got it from here.
642
And that allows me to take a step further into perhaps what I need to be for the next chapter of my life.
643
That's so beautiful.
644
And it is that.
645
It's, oh, that those stories I held on to that I used to take to get me here.
646
I'm so grateful.
647
But now in letting them go, it is going to be also letting go of a version of myself.
648
And it is a death.
649
Waking up is dying over and over again.
650
And it does require a real capacity to grieve.
651
So, that's a beautiful story.
652
Much of your work also applies to parenting, relationships, and daily life.
653
So, what's some wisdom you can share over there?
654
Well, I'm writing a book, or I would say it's writing me for couples right now.
655, because, couples work is really the Olympics, and, so learning how to practice together.
656
And one of the things I really think is important is we need really clear commitments and agreements.
657
I've been using the metaphor of, let's say, I say, Hey, Joad, you want to play soccer?
658, and you say, Yeah, I don't know, what does that look?
659
And I say, Oh, well, here's the rules of the game, and I teach you the rules of the game.
660
And you say, Okay, well, I'm really, I'll play, but I basketball a lot, so I'm gonna dribble.
661
I know you said we're not supposed to touch the ball with our hands, but I want to dribble.
662
Well, now the challenge is that we're playing two different games in a way, and we're gonna have challenges over and over again.
663
Because I'm, Joad, you're not supposed to dribble, that's not the rules of the game, and it's not gonna work this way because I'm not dribbling.
664
And so, it's just that in relationships, we really need clear agreements of what are the rules of engagement here.
665
And so, I think it's important to say things, Hey, do you want to create a relationship in which we don't blame?
666
Would we both commit to that?
667
And let's make an agreement that, and literally, I had in my home with my husband and my kids for I don't know, two years, word blame with a circle,, and the X through it.
668
And we had it as posters around our house to train ourselves that this is a no-blame zone.
669
And that's how we wrote it up: no blame zone.
670
So, when somebody blamed, we'd just point to one of the posters around and we'd say, hey, just a reminder, this is a no-blame zone.
671
So then what would it look to take responsibility?
672
And we trained ourselves until that became just the norm of how we did things.
673
And so I being able to, I took the 15 commitments and I applied them to couples.
674
And that's the 15 commitments first came as the rules of engagement for my relationship and my marriage first.
675
That's how it started.
676
And then we thought, let's just apply them to the business world.

We have something similar at home with my wife where we'll playfully call each other out when we're being victim.
678, so she'll call me out, I'll call her.
679
I'll okay, no, so now you're back in victim mode.
680
And then we just laugh about it.
681
So it just diffuses the moment and it allows us to playfully get back to being in sync.
682
And I've also noticed we'll tap each other out.
683
So for example, if it's bedtime and I'm tired or I'm below the line, basically, I'll tell her, Senia, I'm below the line.
684
Can you do bedtime tonight?
685
And she'll do it.
686
Otherwise, she'll tell me and I'll do it,.
687
But just knowing physically,, if I'm feeling below the line, I'm not going close to the kids because I'm going to be,, I won't myself.
688
So there are these different ways in which we try to adopt your philosophy into our home.
689
Great.
690
I'm so excited.
691
And by the way, I want to let, you could be tapped out from below the line and you can be tapped out from above the line.
692
And so tapped out from above the line is just I gave everything I was to give today and I'm now needing to refuel.
693
So taking care of the kids right now, I don't have the fuel for it.
694
It's not that I'm reactive and triggered and so if I don't have the fuel for it I might become reactive and triggered but I could just say I got to tap out just because it's not friendly not because I'm below the line Oh that's so interesting because I do have a couple of days a week where I'm that and I didn't realize that that could that was even possible yeah yeah because sometimes I just go I gave everything life used me good today I gave everything today and I am now my the I it's the engine used all the gas and I gotta refuel so I just don't have gas right now and that's not good or bad and it's not because I'm reactive it's just what is what about from a parenting standpoint what comes to mind for you from the commitment I just think there's so much about how much shooting we're doing on our kids and how scared we are about trying to control their their future so I have a lot of we we did a conscious parenting talk seminar at the conscious leadership group and that video is still up on our website under the resources page and I highly recommend because I think it just went right to the we went to the essence of what do you have to pay attention to as a parent but I think the and I write I'm writing more about parenting as well because I think there's parenting from above and below the line are such different places and it requires trust and luckily, there's new research coming out basically saying, Hey, parents, you don't have very much to do with your child's personality, nor are you going to have much to do with their overall success, way less than you think.
695
What your main job is, is keep them warm and safe and provide the conditions in which they can,, feel comforted and relaxed, that they know that they're not at any physical threat or emotional threat.
696
But that's your primary job.
697
And then trust them.
698
They're these little beautiful beings that are just going to flower and unfold themselves.
699
There's already so much intelligence over there.
700
So that's one of the things I want to say to parents: just tune into, do I really trust my child?
701
Do I trust that there's some brilliance over there that knows how to unfold itself?
702
And my job is just to help make it.
703, I'm a gardener, literally gardening.
704
And one of the things I know is if you tend to the soil, you really don't have to do much with the plants.
705
It's all about the soil.
706
And so, conscious parenting, in my opinion, is recognizing it's all about the soil for me as a parent to offer that just a nurturing environment where it's got a lot of nutrients and vitality there.
707
And then they know how to grow themselves.
708
Diana, thank you so much.
709, you've reminded us that leadership or life isn't about control or performance, it's about telling the truth and seeing what's alive in us and noticing where we're operating from fear or habit and just choosing something different.
