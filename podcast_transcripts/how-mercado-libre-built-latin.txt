1
Steve Jobs called you.
2
One day I'm walking in the street and I get a phone and a blocked number.
3
I was super young, by the way, at the time.
4
I think I was 16.
5
Pick up.
6
I said, Well, hi, it's fashion.
7
This is Steve from Apple.
8
I need to talk to you about your app.
9
We're not going to be able to have it on the app store.
10
I pushed back a little bit.
11
I told him I read all the rules of the app store.
12
He told me, check again, because we just added a new rule.
13
At 19, you built an app that became the number one app in 19 countries.
14
It absolutely exploded.
15
I got contacted by a lot of different companies, multinationals, governments.
16
Saying,, well, you have the number one app.
17
We want you to build an app for us.
18
You oversee something 18,000 developers.
19
We do around 30,000 deployments per day.
20
We deliver over 5 million packages per day.
21
You're really big on not creating a big distinction between engineering and product.
22
It's hard to separate where engineering stops and product begins, and we don't feel just having a title should determine who is the owner.
23
Is there anything else that might be helpful for folks either about how you operate as a human?
24
Morning routine?
25
We were raised in a very intensely independent way.
26
My mother, mainly the analogy that she used is that she wanted to train us spies.
27
She would drop us in the middle of the city, Mexico City.
28
It would be, you have to get back home.
29
You have to know public transit or ask someone for help and basically solve problems.
30
Just go and get things done.
31
Today, my guest is Sebastian Barrios.
32
Sebas, as most people know him, is currently senior vice president of engineering at Roblox.
33
He was also a longtime head of product and engineering at Mercado Libre.
34
Mercado Libre might be the biggest and most interesting company that you have never heard of, and Sebas might also be the most interesting product leader that you've never heard of.
35
Mercado Libre is currently the most valuable company in Latin America, valued at over $100 billion, which also makes them one of the 150 most valuable companies on the planet.
36
They also have one of the largest engineering teams on the planet, with over 18,000 engineers operating in 18 countries.
37
They deploy an unprecedented 30,000 times a day.
38
The company owns their own trucks and planes.
39
They deliver over 5 million packages a day.
40
At one point, eBay tried to acquire them.
41
They ended up acquiring PayPal instead.
42
Now they are larger than both eBay and PayPal combined.
43
Also, just wait till you hear the stories about Sebas's early life, including how his mom trained him a spy, why he only drinks water, no coffee or tea or juice, why he doesn't listen to music, and also why Steve Jobs personally called him when he was 17 years old, telling him that they are booting his app from the App Store and forever changing the App Store policies as a result.

This episode is brought to you by Merge.
50
Product leaders, yes, you, cringe when they hear the word integration.
51
They're not fun for you to scope, build, launch, or maintain, and integrations probably aren't what led you to product work in the first place.
52
Lucky for you, the folks at Merge are obsessed with integrations.
53
Their single API helps SaaS companies launch over 200 product integrations in weeks, not quarters.
54
Think of Merge Plaid, but for everything B2B SaaS.
55
Organizations RAMP, Drada, and Electric use Merge to access their customers' accounting data to reconcile bill payments, file storage data to create searchable databases and their product, or HRIS data to auto-provision and deprovision access for their customers' employees.
56
And yes, if you need AI-ready data for your SaaS product, then Merge is the fastest way to get it.

68
Sebas, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.
69
I'm super happy to be here.
70
Thank you for hosting me.
71
This is the first time that you're doing a major, let's call it major podcast.
72
I think you can call it major podcast.
73
You can be proud of what you've done.
74
I appreciate that.
75
So, let me just start with a stat that I think is going to blow a lot of people's minds.
76
You oversee something 18,000 developers.
77
Is that right?
78
Is that the right number?
79
That is the right number.
80
18,000 and climbing.
81
I just would specify that they don't report all directly to me.
82
We can talk about how the company is structured, but yes, I lead the technology team that basically powers all of what they do.
83
I think essentially you guys are in the top 10 of most engineers at a company.
84
You're above Salesforce and TikTok, NVIDIA, Adobe, Uber, OpenAI.
85
That's right.
86
I think you have to go into big tech or huge banks to get a larger number.
87
Okay.
88
So a lot of people listening to this have not heard of Mercado Libre.
89
A lot of listeners are in the US, other parts of the country outside of Latin America.
90
Give us just a brief explanation of what Mercado Libre do, and then give us a few more stats that will blow people's minds to the scale of this business at this point.
91
Happy to, happy to.
92
So, you can think of us as a completely vertically integrated e-commerce marketplace.
93
That means buying and selling any product you can think of.
94
And the vertically integrated part means we have our own distribution network, we have our own airplanes, we have our own trucks, we have to do all the technology and coordination behind that.
95
But even, or in addition to that, we also have a very large fintech operation.
96
The two sides of the business are almost the same size.
97
So, we also offer accounts, we offer credit cards, we offer loans, all of that integrated with each other into what we call an ecosystem.
98
Okay, and I saw a stat that you guys plan to have over 100,000 employees by the end of this year.
99
That's right.
100
There's a lot of operations that need to happen for all those packages to be delivered.
101
You asked about some fund statistics, specifically with deliveries.
102
We deliver over 5 million packages per day or items.
103
So you visit most of Latin America.
104
We have some very cool visualizations where if you track the routes of our trucks and delivery vans and whatnot, you paint a picture of Latin America, which is pretty fun.
105
We obviously operate in major cities, but we have very, very large capillarity and reach all the different corners of Latin America.
106
Okay, a couple more stats that you didn't mention.
107
You guys are valued over $100 billion.
108
It's a large company.
109
We don't focus on the stock price that much.
110
But yes, $100 billion, even more so now, depends on how the market's feeling and what the global news are.
111
But yes, one of the top-valued companies on the planet.
112
We have around 100 million users, customers, sellers, people interacting in the platform.
113
And as you mentioned, one of the larger engineering and product building teams on the planet.
114
Hopefully people now get the sense of, holy shit, there's a lot to learn here.
115
There's two buckets to the way I want to approach this conversation.
116
One is just really unique, interesting ways you all operate and how you scale a business this, how you build product.
117
The other is just you as a human are really interesting.
118
And there's a lot of stories I've heard that I want to talk about, but I'm going to save that for next.
119
Let's start with how you all operate.
120
So, one of the things, so I talked to a lot of people that work with you that work at Mercato Libre.
121
One of the themes that came up again and again is: you're really big on not creating a big distinction between engineering and product.
122
It's essentially one team for you guys.
123
Talk about just how that works specifically, just what does that mean and why that's so important to you.
124
For me and for Mericado Libre, it's hard to separate where engineering stops and product begins.
125
We do have a small product organization.
126
There are people in Medical Libre that have the product manager title, but the ratio is much smaller than any other tech company that you would think of.
127
And the way we think about it is that: we're not going to determine who's going to own the product just based on the title.
128
It's going to be based on who's the best for that role.
129
And it turns out that for us, in the majority of the cases, it's the engineering leaders, it's the tech leads, it's the people that can understand what's technically possible, and they're also good.
130
Well, okay, what are the business needs?
131
What are the user needs?
132
What are the users doing?
133
How am I going to measure that?
134
And combine that into a single role.
135
So, to make this even clearer, you have 18,000-ish developers.
136
How many people have the PM title?
137
So, I think it's less than 1,000.
138
I think that would make 5% work in other companies.
139
Maybe you have 10, 20, 30%, even more at other companies.
140
So, two follow-ups here: one is just why do you think operating this way is more effective in your business?
141
And do you need to hire engineers in a different way for them to succeed in this way where they're basically playing the PM role?
142
This works because you want to be as close to the problem as possible, and that probably works being as close to the technology as possible, being as close to the users as possible.
143
You can have it with two different people that have to interact and coordinate, and that obviously works as well, right?
144, I'm not saying this is the only way to do it.
145
Clearly, there are a lot more examples.
146
Maybe we are the exception, and it would be hard to replicate anywhere else.
147
But if you're able to have that whole context in a single mind, in a single person, that can then deliver that vision to the team, I think it leads to great products that users are going to love and enjoy.
148
In terms of hiring, we do, in the interview process, test for product skills, but we mainly do test for engineering skills.
149
I think it's worth being honest about we have a strong bias for engineering, for being technical, for being deep into the details.
150
There's not a lot of tolerance for being in a meeting and getting asked the questions:, well, I need to check with this person to understand the details because I'm not sure what technology we're using.
151, that would not fly.
152
So, there is a bias towards the tech side of it.
153
And then, once you're inside Mercalibre, we'll probably get to know you a lot more, and it'll be very clear if you have the product inclination or if you're more comfortable just with the engineering.
154
What's really interesting about this is a lot of companies start with no PMs, and they're, We never need PMs.
155
We're just going to be engineers leading products, it's going to be amazing.
156
And then, usually, eventually, people, these engineers realize, I don't want to be doing all this bullshit PM work.
157, I just want to code, I want to build.
158
What am I in meetings all day writing specs?
159
And it's interesting, you guys have scaled to a hundred billion-dollar market cap, 18,000 people on the product team developers, and still you're working this way.
160
It's really rare.
161
What do you think has allowed you to operate this way at this scale that maybe other companies can't?
162
Yeah, I think it's also a top-down thing where a lot of the leadership is very technical.
163
They're very into the product.
164
They're also very into the business, into the numbers, into the details.
165
It's amazing to be on the C-level meetings and the questions, the level of attention.
166
I know founder mode is now a term that's there, but the company has been operating that for a while, where discussions will even go as deep as, okay, we're using that copy.
167
That's way too many words.
168
It's not clear.
169
Hey, what is this pixel here where we could use that space for something a lot more useful?
170
And these are literally conversations at the C-level asking, okay, how does this work for users?
171
When you present a feature, and here I'm going to stereotype other companies, it might not be the case, but my understanding is many times, okay, how much revenue can we get from this new feature?
172
Or what's the metric that's going to move for Marcus?
173
Our CEO, the first question is always: okay, how's the user going to experience this?
174
Show me the flow, show me the user experience, are they understanding it?
175
Show me the metrics that people are liking what we're doing.
176
Putting the users before the revenue obviously turns into revenue in the future, in the long term, which is what you're looking for.
177
So, again, I think the top-down version of that, maintaining the culture and being able to select for the top of the top talent in a whole region, in multiple countries, I think it's what's allowed that to happen.
178
And the business, as you said, there's a lot of technology, right?
179, you need to do the routing for all the buses, the trucks, the planes, the distribution centers.
180
You need to do routing for picking items within the distribution centers, risk, content moderation, search, robotics.
181
There's a really long list of really fun initiatives that we're working on.
182
They're all very technical and turn into value for our users.
183
I can't help but ask: how does AI impact this way of working where engineers are doing more and more of the PM work?
184
Is that just accelerating that further?
185
Is there anything you can share about just how AI is changing the way you all operate?
186
It's a great question because you probably always hear it from the other side, no?
187, okay, now people who are more product-oriented are not going to need engineers as much.
188
So, for us, the change is accelerating what people can do on both sides.
189
But I don't think there's any competition.
190
And again, we don't see a line between product and engineering as strongly as other companies.
191
So, I'm extremely happy when someone who's more product-oriented comes in and can start developing more stuff on their own, even just demos.
192
I think we can talk about the AI hype a little bit in the future, but it's definitely great to make demos, to turn ideas into something that you can touch, something that you can see, designs, and seeing a lot more people enabled to do that.
193
I think it's just accelerating everything we do.
194
On the actual coding side, of course, it started as advanced autocomplete, and now you have agentic frameworks, cursor, and windsurf.
195
OpenAI just made an acquisition.
196
Clearly, it's a big shift in the way we develop technology.
197
It's not at the point where it can do anything and everything, and security, compliance, all the different things that go around turning a demo or a product into something that's going to reach the production or the market takes time.
198
But I'll say we're taking it even further.
199
We always to think in terms of platforms.
200
It's one of the reasons why we've been able to scale the team so much.
201
We have a great internal development platform that takes care of a lot of scaling, security, building, testing, compliance.
202
So developers and teams can just focus on adding value.
203
And we're taking the same approach with AI.
204
We developed an internal platform called Verdi that basically abstracts away a lot of the complexities around, okay, where are you going to get data?
205
How is it going to be authorized?
206
And that in Intel has been evolving as the models become more capable.
207
Now you can have more agents, agentic frameworks, things taking action, taking over longer tasks.
208
And we're seeing great results with skipping code entirely.
209
I think it's a fun one where the prompt or what you want the product to do is everything you tell the system.
210
We came up with ways to use our existing code.
211
So it's not there's no code in any of what I'm talking about, but we basically can extract the functionality of every single one of our microservices.
212
And then we can have agents build and use different parts of different services and create new features for users end-to-end with a UI.
213
So that's something that is still experimental, obviously, but it's happening and it's just going to accelerate as the models get better.
214
So we literally have things that are taking existing code.
215
So it's not code doesn't exist, but you don't have to write any new code.
216
There's a lot of functionality that we already have on the platform.
217
And you can combine different parts of it and turn it into a new feature or product without any intervention from any code, extra code.
218
That is very cool.
219
So essentially, you have all these APIs and microservices, and your agents can just use what already exists to add new features.
220
Exactly.
221
And if you extend it a little more, you could even reach a point where UIs and apps are entirely generated.
222
These are all the things that you can do inside Mercada Libre.
223
You can buy stuff, you can get a credit card, you can move money around, and then have a completely personalized UI for user predicting what are you going to do next, and then just having that as the main screen.
224
Maybe you have other screens, obviously, that allow you to do everything, but it's an exciting future.
225
I think we're going to see a lot more automated UI.
226
Wow.
227
Okay.
228
I'm going to try to resist just making every conversation about AI.
229
So let's leave that aside and maybe we'll come back to it.
230
But let's zoom out a little bit.
231
And I want to hear other key or very unique ways of working that you have figured out that allow you to operate this team of 18,000 developers and continue to ship great products.
232
So if you had to pick,, I don't know, two or three key ways of working, what would those be?
233
One big one, it's a cliche, but it's true, is the fear of failure.
234
We empower our teams to make mistakes.
235, no one's going to get fired for believing something that didn't work in the sense that maybe the market was not ready or we had the wrong idea on where we have to implement.
236
Obviously, there's a lot less tolerance for bad quality and it failed because the product wasn't good or is going offline or those kinds of failures are much less tolerated.
237
But we do encourage our teams to take a lot of risks on what we should be working on.
238
We also let them be very independent.
239
I think it goes hand in hand.
240
So for example, we don't operate with OKRs where everything just trickles down into what every team is supposed to do.
241
We have very high-level objectives on where we want the company to be.
242
And they're not even that long term.
243
It's not we have a 10-year plan.
244
And I think in a market that's changing so much, even before AI, this is an extremely competitive market with very dynamic regulations in multiple countries.
245
So it's hard to say,, okay, this is a plan for 10 years, and these are the OKRs.
246
And now everyone go into your teams and implement the specific features that are going to point to that.
247
The way we run it is these are the objectives.
248
These are maybe some of the new businesses or areas where we would to explore.
249
But everything else is up to the teams.
250
We just cascade the main vision of where the company is going.
251
And there's a lot of another cliche, freedom and responsibility, saying, okay, do whatever, literally, whatever you think is best for our users, for the company, for what we want to accomplish.
252
There's going to be tight feedback loops on that to also make sure everyone's pointing in the same direction.
253
But you can't be telling 18,000 people exactly what they should be working on every day and expect that to work.
254
So there's a fun combination of what can you delegate, what can you not delegate.
255
We're also, I think, very hands-on wherever we can be.
256
So we can't be on every single detail.
257
But in the projects that we feel are most important, the whole leadership team goes extremely deep into working with the team, understanding what the restrictions are, what's working, what's not working, and pushing the team forward.
258
So I think that's probably the main one.
259
We also talked about putting users before revenue.
260
I think that's another big one that we've liked.
261
And there's another tricky aspect of it, because life is trade-offs.
262
But as we say, okay, let's be very distributed on what the teams are going to be working on.
263
Then you can end up with a product that has great parts, but once you put them all together, it's horrible and it sucks.
264
People don't it.
265
So you also need a mix of, okay, this is the holistic vision.
266
This is what we want to accomplish.
267
This is what probably the end product is going to look.
268
And then you can build the features.
269
And there's no one rule that basically applies to all projects.
270
There are times where you can have more freedom.
271
There are times where you do require a lot more, yeah, one vision of where things are going.
272
So I think that's another important one.
273
What else?
274
We to observe users more than talk to users.
275
You always hear talk to users, listen to users.
276
They're going to tell you what they want, what they need.
277
That works sometimes.
278
We've seen that what works best is just to observe them, whether that's literally user research sessions and just seeing what people are doing with the product.
279
I'm sure this has happened to you and to many people that listen to your show and you cringe at all the assumptions that are being crushed before your eyes as someone types in their email and their name in the same field because your field said email comma name.
280
So you could either have the email or the username and people say, well, I'll write both because that's what they're asking of me.
281
So a lot of examples this where observing users is extremely valuable.
282
I think those are the ones that come to mind.
283
Okay, this is a great.
284
Let me follow up on a couple of these.
285
So what I'm hearing is there's a lot of independence and distribution of ownership where teams can go off and build their own stuff.
286
As you pointed out, it's important to have a vision and some sense of what success looks and make sure everyone's rolling in the same direction.
287
Just going a level deeper, how do you operationalize that way of operating where teams can do their own thing, but you also share vision?
288, how often do you update that vision?
289
How do you communicate it?
290
And then how do you check in with teams to make sure they're heading towards the right direction?
291
We don't do anything magical there.
292
We do a lot of design reviews.
293
I think it's a term that they would probably use or product reviews in the US, where it's, okay, this is what we're working on.
294
This is what it looks.
295
This is what all the pieces together are doing and working or not working.
296
And there, the leadership team is extremely candid and honest on their feedback, always cordial and a happy work environment, but definitely on the side of being honest about what's working, what's not working.
297
Whether the vision was mistaken as well.
298
There were many times where we've thought this was the right direction.
299
Turns out it's not, and we can pivot very quickly into a new thing.
300
So no big secrets.
301
Maybe the only secret is you can't check absolutely everything when you have 18,000 people.
302
So to give you another crazy statistic, we do around 30,000 deployments per day, changes to production.
303
30,000 PRs a day.
304
PRs, deploys, changes to a system.
305
It can be configuration changes, it can be database updates or whatever, things that change.
306
So there's no way anyone can check what those 30,000 changes are doing.
307
That's more than one per developer.
308
Yeah, some of them are automated changes as well.
309
But yeah, we have a very high speed of execution.
310
And yeah, it's quite fun to be around something that's changing that rapidly and that dramatically.
311
We, again, have many different businesses, many different competitors in different businesses who operate at world class, whether it's finance, whether it's e-commerce.
312
I would even say...
313
Brazil is probably one of the most competitive markets on the planet for e-commerce.
314
You have local players, you have international players, you have players from Asia that are even funded by video game revenue and profits.
315
So it's a great dynamic market to be around.
316
I that optimism, that way of framing it.
317
Well, we competition, especially when you're competing with the top of the top, and it pushes you to be better as well.
318
This point you made earlier about being the top company in a market is really interesting.
319
I was wondering if I wanted to come to this, but I think it's interesting to talk about for a bit.
320
So I've had a few product leaders from companies Revolut, N26.
321
I haven't had Intercom on yet, but the co-founder is coming on soon.
322
And a theme across all those conversations about how they've built such a strong product team that pumps out incredible product leaders is they're the top startup in their market.
323
And it's just an interesting thread of just how much power comes with being the most successful company in a market and just the cycle of success that comes from that in terms of hiring amazing people.
324
Is there anything else there that you think might be interesting to folks that are, I don't know, that want to try to do something this other than just build a successful business?
325
I think it applies to many things.
326
And you often also hear,, well, you're not in the Bay Area.
327
You're not in the pinnacle of the capital of technology, so how can you build amazing technology?
328
And there are advantages as well.
329
I think you would find the same with, you mentioned a bunch of companies that have experienced that where, okay, if you can be the top in a region where there's great talent, and by statistical definition, there's great talent everywhere.
330
It probably follows a probabilistic distribution, so it's everywhere.
331
A lot of it does flow into the US, and it's absolutely true that there's a very high concentration of talent outside specific companies.
332
I think that's probably the one thing you don't get outside of the big tech hubs where you are the top company, but you are the only top company.
333
And I'm exaggerating a bit, right?
334
There are great companies throughout the world and in Latin America, and you have unicorns and there are outliers.
335
But the truth is, you're setting your own path and you're setting your own map and setting your own destination.
336
And you're building things that have not been built before in a different way.
337
And it's very fun, that's for sure.
338
But I'll correct.
339
I said intercom.
340
I don't think, I think they're technically a US-based company, but I think a lot of their team is in Ireland or is originally in Ireland, just to be clear there.
341
And then there's other companies Canva and Atlassian.
342
I feel there's this really,, what I'm taking away from this is if you want to build a company outside of the US, you need to be the best in that market to take advantage of this cycle that happens where the best come to you.
343
Yeah, maybe you could say you have to be the best eventually if you want to have that flywheel running.
344
It's hard to start and be the best and the biggest when you're just getting started.
345
But I think knowing that there's great talent everywhere and that it is possible to attract them without being in a specific tech hub, maybe even empowering, so, okay, I want to start a company here.
346
I think we can also be honest that it will be harder.
347
It is easier to recruit and build a team where you're in a place where the high density is all over.
348
Another thing that happens to us is that many people try to recruit from us, and that's something that we have to deal with.
349
But if you get that flywheel going, it becomes into a clear advantage.
350
I want to come back to something you said that I think might be, there might be something more there, which is around reducing the fear of failure.
351
A lot of companies and leaders say that.
352
They're, yeah, yeah, we let people fail.
353
Totally.
354
No problem.
355
But then in reality, they have performance reviews, they got to show impact, they have to show success.
356
Is there something you do to create that culture where failing is okay?
357, what can people learn from you to create that culture?
358
I think that question is even more on how does culture work at any company, especially at hours.
359
It's very clear that it's not what you write on the walls or what you put on your website.
360
From what Flearn and what we've seen, it's something it's what you do.
361
It's what the leadership team is doing, is how I get my performance reviews, how I get either praise or not praise.
362
And in public, what are the acceptable errors?
363
What are the not acceptable errors?
364
Again, if we have a system outage, it's obviously unacceptable.
365
That's not the error that we're going for.
366
We're going for, well, you took a risk and a very bold vision, and it turns out it was not the right path.
367
You're not going to get penalized for that.
368
You might even get a promotion, and those messages that you send are extremely powerful.
369
Who has what title, who gets promoted, who doesn't get promoted, who is getting what praise in public?
370
What announcements are made on new products.
371
How do we talk about things that didn't work?
372
One very clear one is, okay, this didn't work.
373
And yes, we risk, but the person that led the project was fired.
374
It's, well, then you're not living what you have on your website.
375
So I think it is not more complicated than that.
376
You need to live it, you need to show it.
377
And you also need to have people that will take in that culture and also propagate it into their teams.
378
That's also the way it scales in the organization.
379
But it definitely starts with the top management of the company and again, what they are focused on, what messages they're sending to the rest of the company.
380
They participate in the product reviews.
381
They are very aware, at least, of all the big features that we launch.
382
And the feedback is direct and clear.
383
Today's episode is brought to you by LinkedIn Ads.
384
One of the hardest and also most important parts of B2B marketing is reaching the right people.
385
I'm constantly getting ads for products that I will never buy.
386
And I almost feel sorry for the money that these companies are spending, pitching me on their spend management software or some cybersecurity solution that my one-man business just does not need.
387
When you're ready to reach the right professionals, use LinkedIn ads.
388
LinkedIn has grown to a network of over 1 billion professionals, including 130 million decision makers.
389
And that's where it stands apart from other ad platforms.
390
You can target your ad buyers by job title, industry, company, role, seniority, skills, even company revenue.
391
All the professionals that you need to reach in one place.
392
Stop wasting budget on the wrong audience and start targeting the right professionals only on LinkedIn ads.
393
LinkedIn will even give you $100 credit on your next campaign so that you can try it for yourself.
394
Just go to linkedin.com/slash podleny.
395
That's linkedin.com/slash podleny.
396
Terms and conditions apply only on LinkedIn ads.
397
You talked about this idea of being direct and honest, but also maintaining a cordial environment.
398
Talk about just that balance in the culture you've created of being direct.
399 this idea of radical candor is what I'm hearing.
400
Yeah, so the book became very, very popular.
401
The book Radical Candor.
402
Yeah, yeah.
403
Oh, awesome.
404
Sorry we had Kim Scott on the podcast.
405
It's a great book, and the concept is also great.
406
I would even say it's even more important in Latin America, in some Asian countries where you have a culture, and I'm Latin American, so I can talk a little bit about stereotypes without it becoming offensive, especially ones that are true, where there's a lot of hierarchy.
407
And I'm not going to tell my boss that he's wrong.
408
We'll just going to do this because he said so or she said so.
409
This is the way it works.
410
And this is the way it's always been done.
411
So that's the way we're going to do it.
412
I don't want to stand out.
413
These are cultural stereotypes that we are extremely aware of when we operate.
414
People are extremely polite in Latin America as well.
415
If you're traveled, everyone will smile at you.
416
It will be very hard for someone to say no to something.
417
Even meetings or whatnot, or yes, but later, yes, but later.
418
And they mean no.
419
I think there, Argentina and other countries, but Argentina, where the company was founded, is an exception to that, where people are very direct.
420
I will tell my boss if he's wrong.
421
It's something that I love about the company, and we've been able to export that and also select for people that will behave in that way.
422
But yes, we're extremely direct, extremely candid.
423
We're honest about what's working, what's not working.
424
And it's a learning that every manager or leader goes through.
425, well, I don't want to hurt people's feelings.
426
I want to be friends with everyone.
427
I think we all start on that path.
428
And eventually you realize that people the honesty.
429
They might not it in the very short term or in the medium term, sometimes even.
430
But my experience has been: if you're coming from a place of honesty, again, if you're not insulting anyone or crossing a line where things feel personal, people appreciate the feedback.
431
People growing.
432
If you have your performance review and everything comes back positive, what are you going to do with that?
433
I was, well, he's doing great.
434
Everything's perfect.
435
Thank you for being a part of the company.
436
Well, what could I be doing better?
437
What's not working?
438
It's also a skill to separate that from your person.
439
We do have situations where I've had to have conversations on, well, you got this strong feedback, but it's not the product.
440
It's maybe on the vision that we are pursuing or on the execution that the work has nothing to do with you.
441
We can go out and have lunch and we'll still be cordial.
442
But this idea of, well, the companies should be families and it's not true because you behave extremely different with your family.
443
There's no expectation of high performance.
444, in some families, obviously, and in some cases, even in mine, we can talk about that.
445
But it's always from a different perspective.
446
Whereas I think the analogy that we use much more often is of a high-performance sports team, where it's very clear where the line is between, yes, we can have fun together and we should as we work on interesting things.
447
But when you are talking about work and the performance and what's working, what's not working, the results speak for themselves usually, and we just don't hide that from anyone.
448
Speaking of that, along those same lines, I heard you do this, you do something that is a little controversial these days, but you did this a long time ago, which is you send a weekly email asking what did you get done this week, and you share what you got done this week.
449
Talk about just that.
450
Yeah, yeah.
451
So it became a meme, what was it, one or two years ago.
452
I used to do it before that, I should say.
453
And I should also clarify that I don't have an expectation that people are going to send that to me.
454
It's something I do myself.
455
So I'll go over what I did in the week, what worked, what didn't work, even what interesting things I discovered.
456
And I will share that with the executive team, with our CEO who I report to.
457
I'll share some of those with my team.
458
It basically helps me keep track of what's working, what's not working.
459
I usually also get feedback on those emails or help or saying, well, let's talk about this and this and that.
460
So I think that's something super simple that anyone can do.
461
You can write a weekly email to your boss or to your team and saying, well, this is what happened this week.
462
This is what worked.
463
This is what didn't work.
464
This is maybe something I need help with or something that stuck.
465
Maybe we can unlock it together.
466
I think it's strange that not, I haven't heard a lot of people doing it.
467
I think I read it somewhere a couple of years ago, and that's probably where I got the idea.
468
I'll look it up to see if we can link it on your notes.
469
So I don't take credit for it.
470
I wrote a post about this,.
471
I called it the state of me.
472
Okay, maybe it was you.
473
I wonder if it was.
474
Maybe it was you.
475
Either way, I'll link to this post and the whole idea.
476
And there's a less controversial way of asking this instead of what did you get done this week, which is, I call it the state of me, I call it the state of Lenny email.
477
And basically, every week, it was a weekly thing for me, not a daily thing.
478
I email my manager.
479
Here's what I got done.
480
Here's my next set of priorities.
481
And here's blockers I need you to help.
482
Oh, I probably got it from you.
483
It's sounding extremely familiar.
484
So, I send a weekly email.
485
I call it a weekly update.
486
It's also not what did I get done this week.
487
It can be what I got done on the week, but important things are happening, your releases.
488
That also frees up a lot of time, for example, with my COO, where, okay, on the weekly meeting, we don't have to talk about those specific things, or we can pick out from that email what's relevant, what's working, what's not working.
489
So, definitely a great tool.
490
And I'm pretty sure I got from your post just hearing you.
491
What a circle of light you've got here.
492
Okay, so speaking of things that you did before other people, something else that came up a lot in chatting with folks that work with you is they pointed out that you're really good at not falling for hype cycles.
493
You're good at being really pragmatic about things that everyone's really excited about, crypto, Gen AI these days.
494
How do you approach stuff?
495
How do you approach new things that everyone's super excited about and not fall into this trap of just, oh, we all got to pivot and do this thing that everyone else is doing?
496
I hadn't thought about it that way, but it's true.
497
It's true in some sense, because it's not I just ignore it.
498
So, I think I bought or even mined my first Bitcoin in 2010 or 12 or something that.
499
We can leave it undisclosed how many and how many I still have.
500
Why are you even working?
501
No, not enough for that.
502
A lot of great lessons on selling and when the right time and whatnot.
503
I had those lessons too.
504
So, it's not I ignored what was happening, no, but I'm definitely skeptic of most things, I would say, even.
505
I doing a lot of research.
506
Deep research is a great tool.
507
I use it all the time for a lot of things.
508
I do it myself as well.
509
So with crypto, for example, I love the technology,.
510
I think there are some very fun breakthroughs there, the distributed consensus, and how you get a single thing.
511
But then you start to run some of the numbers on, okay, so what's the throughput?
512
And then what can you put in there, at least with the technology that we had at the time?
513
A lot of things are moving quickly, and you get layer two and layer three and whatnot.
514
But I think having a good understanding of the fundamentals and also being involved probably in what I would call quote unquote the real world in a business and understanding the scale of what's necessary for things to work is it's helpful.
515
Keeping a level head on what are some of the main characteristics.
516
So we can talk about, and by the way, we have crypto and Mercado Liure, we have our own cryptocurrency.
517
So it's not we to say, well, crypto is not useful and it's very useful in Latin America and countries where access to US dollars is not as easy as in other places.
518
But I think going from that to saying,, okay, every single thing on the planet is going to run on the blockchain, that's where some of my alarms start to go off.
519
And it's, well, it can be a great technology and it can be very successful without having to take over the world, which can also turn into AI, where, again, the claims are that it will take over the world, and happy to talk about that.
520
But just understanding the fundamentals of the technology that's being potentially hyped and having a good understanding of how it could be applied to something useful for people, I think it's where it's been helpful.
521
Awesome.
522
Okay.
523
Let's pivot to talking about you as a human.
524
There's just so many stories I heard from people that I want to hear about.
525
Okay, so one is that you built an app, you put an app store, Steve Jobs called you, and he's, Sebastian, we got to remove your app.
526
Yeah.
527
Talk about that story.
528
Yeah, so we should clarify that the app was a bit strange.
529
So it was an app that literally helped you drain your phone's battery.
530
There were two reasons why I made it.
531
One was because I was learning about all the different sensors on the phone, GPS and gyroscope and the screen and whatnot.
532
So I said, okay, I'm going to turn them all on at the same time.
533
And that's going to really warm up your phone.
534
On the other end, there was this trend.
535
I'm not even sure where that ended up, where it was better for your phone to run completely out of battery and then recharge it.
536
I think now the recommendation is that it should stay between 10% and 80% at all times to maintain battery health.
537
I was, okay, so when you have 2% left and you just want to get it over with and get the battery down, you open this app and drain it.
538
I that there's a reason for this because I could see you just doing it for fun, but I there's functionality here.
539
Yeah, yeah.
540
I always try to make it useful, at least for me.
541
So I put it on the app store, and this was the time where the app store was starting and the app review process, and people were getting very mad that their apps were getting rejected.
542
We're used to a world where I just put my app out there and anyone can download it.
543
So developers were going to the press to say, well, Apple is not approving my app, and then articles will be written and it would be a PR thing.
544
So the executive team at Apple, including Steve, were calling developers to inform them that their apps were not going to be approved, that they were taken off the app store, trying to avoid them going to the press and just being more personal and explaining what was wrong with the app.
545
And so one day I'm walking in the street and I get a phone and a blocked number, maybe I can't identify it.
546
Pick up.
547
I said, well, hi, Sebastian.
548
This is Steve from Apple.
549
I'm here to, well, I need to talk to you about your app.
550
We're not going to be able to have it on the App Store.
551
This is draining people's batteries and we don't want that for people.
552
I pushed back a little bit.
553
I told him, well,, I read all the rules of the App Store before making this app, and there's no rule against draining the battery.
554
And he told me, check again, because we just added a new rule that apps cannot overly drain the battery on the phones.
555
So I'm happy to say there is an App Store rule that was made specifically for me at the time.
556
I didn't realize I had spoken to Steve Jobs until a couple of minutes later.
557
It was, well, yeah, someone called Steve from Apple.
558
There's probably a lot of Steve's.
559
I was, well,, that voice sounded extremely familiar.
560
And I was, okay.
561
And then articles started popping up of Steve and the rest of the executive team calling developers to let them know that this was happening.
562
So I was happy to confirm that I had at least had a short phone conversation with Steve, quite the legend.
563
That is an incredible story.
564
First of all, I just love that Steve Jobs was calling random app developers.
565
Founder mode, right?
566, how did he have the time?
567
I just love that he took,, that they realized this is important.
568
And if people hear from us, that'll go over better.
569
Even though people kept posting, right?
570, people are, Steve Jauscalib should touch down my app.
571
So a little backfired, maybe.
572
And he, how did he sound?
573
Was he just, did he, was he this nice radical candor balance of nice and yeah, yeah.
574
And it's not what you would against here typically hear from him.
575
No, he was a lot more mercurial, I think is the term that people use.
576
But none of that on the call.
577
He was pretty nice and chill.
578
And so, well, we're not going to allow your app.
579
Just matter of fact.
580
Yeah.
581
And then you said that they added this rule before he called you.
582
We have a new rule.
583
I guess they could do that, right?
584
It's our place, our store.
585
Wow.
586
Okay.
587
Amazing story.
588
Did that discourage you from building more apps, or are you just, holy shit, this is not a good thing?
589
No, absolutely.
590
No.
591
I was very happy to talk to Steve.
592
I sent him a few emails.
593
I never got a reply, to be honest, but yeah, sent some emails on feedback.
594
Again, the App Store, the iOS and whatnot.
595
I was super young, by the way, at the time.
596
I think I was 16 or 17, 17 or 18 when I developed that app.
597
So I was, yeah, I didn't know what it meant to get a call from him and to send him emails and expect a reply and whatnot.
598
So it was a fun experience.
599
And I kept building more apps.
600
I started a mobile app development company a few months after that, which is another fun story.
601
Well, maybe this is the story, but I know that at 19 you built an app that became the number one app in 19 countries.
602
Maybe just briefly share that story.
603
That one is super fun.
604
So I had a girlfriend who I really liked at the time.
605
I don't know if that happened in the US, but in many Latin American countries, and I think throughout the world, phone companies came out with something where you could call five numbers for five minutes for free, five for five for five.
606
So I had my girlfriend's number on there and we would talk for five minutes.
607
But what they did is if you went over one second, they would charge the whole five minutes.
608
And phone bills were expensive.
609
Now, we're going to sound old people when we talk about this soon.
610
That was a big deal, especially for a teenager.
611
I didn't have money to throw around on my phone bill.
612
So I made this app that was extremely simple.
613
It alarmed you,, it sent a notification when you were close to reaching the five minutes.
614
So, you could just hang up and call again and have another five free minutes and then call again.
615
I did it for myself.
616
It turned out to be a good investment because I ended up marrying my girlfriend.
617
And she's still my wife, and we have a beautiful family together.
618
It also turned out to be a good business decision.
619
So, it cost $100, I think it still does, to upload an app to the App Store.
620
So, I thought, okay, I need to sell around 100 copies.
621, there are fees and whatnot, but let's say I have to sell 100 copies for $1, so I'll put it on the app store.
622
That was my business plan, and it absolutely exploded.
623
It became the top-selling app in Mexico and a lot of other different countries.
624
It was not a free app, and it was also completely local, so there was no back-end, no cost, no advertising.
625
So, it was a very profitable endeavor that also very quickly turned into a business in itself.
626
And then a separate business where people, this was when the app store was just starting, when the iPhone was getting big.
627
So, I got contacted by a lot of different companies, multinationals, governments, saying, Well, you have the number one app, so we want you to build an app for us.
628
There weren't that many people into iPhone OS at the time.
629
It was called Development Objective-C, and all the ways to build a good app.
630
So, I started building apps myself for a bunch of different people and companies.
631
Eventually, I couldn't scale that and had to hire people.
632
So, I hired my friends from college and taught them how to do apps.
633
We all learned from a free online course from Stanford.
634
It was a great course on how to build apps.
635
Because I remember going to my university professors and saying, Hey, the iPhone is cool.
636
I want to learn how to make these apps.
637
Who can teach me?
638
And they're, No one,, this is new.
639, no one knows how to do it.
640
So, I also had to learn on my own, but then I was able to teach people, turn that into a mobile app company.
641
Did that for about two years.
642
And it turns out to be a very good business, but it's also boring to have to start over new projects and new projects and projects.
643
I going deep into things and iterating and creating products that people love.
644
So we decided to sell the consulting side of that, keep the mainly mobile team, and start working on fun products that we could scale and scale exponentially.
645
One of those was ordering taxis from your phone.
646
So at the time, Uber was starting in San Francisco.
647
They started a private network of drivers and fancy cars.
648
And eventually it was open to a lot of people.
649
So I thought, well, that would work great for taxis.
650
And Mexico City is the city with the most taxis on the planet, at least outside Asia.
651
And at the time in San Francisco, for example, at least taxis had a clunky computer and they were these tracked GPS or whatnot, but in Mexico, they use radios and you had to call a number and you never knew if your taxi was coming or not.
652
So we developed a very simple test.
653
It sounds silly now that these companies are huge, but I was not sure are people going to trust getting on a car that they got from a phone in Mexico City, when your parents have told you,, don't trust people on the internet and don't get into strangers' cars.
654
So, we're combining two things that people were taught not to do by their parents.
655
We decided to just do the passenger app and test whether people this.
656
So, when you requested a car, we would call a taxi company and basically just call for you and send the car over.
657
And that was enough for it to explode.
658, we could not deal with the demand.
659
We had to build an intermediary call center to call other call centers while we developed the driver side of the marketplace and got drivers on board.
660
And once you got the flywheel and you got a lot of drivers and a lot of riders and the network effects, then it started to scale and work.
661
That was a fun experience.
662
Oh, man.
663
You're just a well of fascinating stories.
664
I love this journey of sharing of just at 16, I think you built that app that Steve Jobs called you about.
665
I was already, yeah, yeah, maybe 17.
666
Okay, from that to now managing something 18,000 engineers.
667
I love this journey.
668
Also, competing with Uber along the way.
669
Yeah, yeah.
670
Very intense competition.
671
I've always enjoyed competition.
672
That's the epitome of intense competition from what I hear.
673
Okay, another interesting thing about you that I've heard is that you drink no alcohol, which I think is common these days, but it's something you've been doing for a long time.
674
You also drink no tea, no coffee, no juice, no soda, just water.
675
What's going on there?
676
Why is that?
677
I just love water.
678
Water is amazing.
679
I think it's not the same reason for everything.
680
It has turned now into, well, I'm happy with water.
681, why do I have to alter my brain with chemicals?
682, I my brain.
683
We have a good relationship.
684
And I sleep well.
685
And I don't feel I need stimulants of any kind.
686
I already have a lot of fun.
687
It did start in different ways.
688
So the legal drinking age in Mexico is 18, a lot younger than in the US.
689
So people start drinking when they're 16.
690
So very early, I got to see the effects of at least drinking a lot can have on your body.
691
And I just never wanted to be in that situation where I didn't have control of my destiny and control, right?
692
We don't have a lot of control on our destinies, but at least physical control of, I want to walk there and can I walk there.
693
I think that really marks you when you see young people overdrinking.
694
It's not a fun picture.
695
Then I understand people, adults, can drink responsibly and have fun with friends and whatnot, but I never got into it.
696
And I think it's an acquired taste.
697
I don't particularly enjoy the flavor of beer and different alcohols.
698
Coffee, it's also similar.
699
I don't how it tastes.
700
It takes extremely bitter to me.
701
I also think it's an acquired taste where it's, okay, well, the effect is great because I get a lot of energy.
702
And then you start to appreciate the flavor, but I don't think it starts with the flavor.
703
So again, I never got into it.
704
Tea, I think, is something that I could drink, but I just never think of drinking it.
705
And I'll probably erase you.
706
Even one stranger that I don't know if my the friends you you interviewed mentioned, but I also don't listen to a lot of music.
707
Also, when I program, I to program in silence, which I know seems extremely strange to to a lot of programmers and developers.
708
And I think the reason for that one, and also talking about the interesting background, is my dad's an orchestra conductor.
709
So I went to maybe hundreds of concerts for big orchestras and backstage.
710
And it was very fun.
711
But I think I had enough music for a while.
712
And it's not I don't enjoy music.
713
My wife is really into music and we listen to music together and with our kids and everything.
714
But I never have the idea of putting on music myself.
715
So that's another strange one to share.
716
That was a good one.
717
I had not heard that one.
718
And then another couple things I heard is that you basically don't do any social media.
719
You also don't watch the news.
720
You don't watch TV really.
721
Is that all true?
722
That is true.
723
That is true.
724
For a really long time, we didn't even have a TV, the device.
725
We bought one when my son was born, and we couldn't go to the movies anymore.
726
So I do media.
727
I movies from time to time.
728
We do watch shows from time to time, but we can watch them on an iPad.
729
I think it's a lot less addictive if the screen is small.
730
So even though we have a T V now, we don't use it very often.
731
I love reading.
732
And The social media thing, I think it's worth qualifying as well.
733, I enjoy X a lot, Twitter, and reading what people are thinking, what's happening, what's not happening.
734
That's probably my main source of news.
735
I don't follow any news organizations just because I feel I'm going to find out if something extremely important is happening.
736 now, the whole political and geopolitical environment is extremely volatile.
737
And I hear about that from people that I follow.
738
And sometimes I'll retweet articles and I'll read them.
739
There was a fun memory of my childhood when we had a TV in the house.
740
And my mom, who's also a very curious character, stuck a sign to it that said, everything you see here is a lie.
741
She stuck the sign to the TV.
742
Yeah, I don't think she meant it for news and she didn't get into the whole misinformation thing and whatnot.
743
It was mostly on, well, you're going to watch cartoons of people flying and be careful, don't jump off the roof of the house.
744
And I think it was more in that sense, but it probably stuck with me of being very independent-minded and do your own research and understand what you're hoping for and what you want to do.
745
Again, I'm not closing my ears and eyes to what's happening in the world.
746
And I do follow a lot of tech coverage and that I enjoy a lot, new programming languages, new frameworks, new model developments.
747
So when I talk about news, it's probably the bad news that I think people can sometimes even get addicted to.
748
Of, okay, if I turn on the T V and put the local news channel, it's just going to be bad news.
749
And I know that,, statistically, it's not all bad news.
750
So, why am I going to watch a show that's pointing out very unique things that don't happen very often that are not happy stories?
751
I don't know who said this once, but it's always stuck with me along these lines of what you just said: that we're just not designed to know all the bad things happening in the world every day.
752, we lived in small tribes where a couple maybe something bad happened that day.
753
We're not evolved to comprehend so many calamities globally that we should not even know.
754
Absolutely, right?
755
I can't imagine our brains were evolved into, well,, you open your phone and you get unlimited information about any single topic that you want.
756
I think you have to be purposeful of what you're reading, what you're seeing.
757
You can find absolutely anything.
758
Amazing things, horrible things.
759
So, why am I going to focus on the horrible things?
760
I love that, and I feel the same way.
761
This is such a cool glimpse into just what it takes to be extremely successful, to go from building this app that Steve Dropshed down to running a company and a team this size.
762
Is there anything else along those lines that we haven't talked about that might be helpful for folks either about how you operate as a human, a morning routine, trick?
763
I don't know, anything else that we haven't touched on along those lines?
764
I don't have as strict a routine as you would expect when you talk to executives and whatnot,, well, this is the time that I do this, the time that I do this.
765, I think what's worked great for me is to follow my curiosity.
766, thankfully, I think I have good intuition,, but even in life and in my work,, on it's hard to say,, well, this is a formula for what you should focus on today.
767
It's, I have an intuition of what I'm most curious about.
768
And thankfully, that usually aligns with what we should be working on and where I can add the most value to my teams, to the company, to my family, to my career, to the things I'm learning.
769
I think that that's probably what's been the guiding principle for me.
770
Follow your curiosity, what excites you.
771
It's also probably what you're going to be good at, because it's hard to compete with someone who loves what they're doing if you don't love that thing.
772
But if you go in and say, well, this is my curiosity, this is what I love, I'm probably going to be good at it.
773
And it's not going to be something I have to force myself into.
774
So I think that that's something that I've done throughout my whole life and career that's worked very well.
775
I had Toby Lutke on the podcast, and we were talking about raising kids for a little bit.
776
And we chatted about what do you want your kid to learn most?
777, what's the most important trait to develop?
778
And his inkling is developing curiosity.
779
Developing curiosity, I think I would agree.
780
I think the other one that you need is probably, it's also a trending topic now, but agency.
781
I was saying it's not probably enough to just be curious, but be curious and go get what you want.
782
We were raised in a very intensely independent way.
783
So my mother mainly had these fun ideas on how she wanted us to be.
784
She wanted us to be able to handle, quote unquote, any situation.
785
And the analogy that she used is that she wanted to train us spice.
786
I was thinking Sparta.
787
Yeah, well, I'll share one fun story.
788
One morning she wakes us up,, hey, we're going camping.
789
Everyone get ready.
790, no warning.
791
We're leaving right now.
792
I remember my little brother, just so you understand how that plant works.
793
His only question was, should I go in my pajamas or should I change or something?
794
So we go and turns out I think it would be hard to call it camping because we were camping with no gear.
795
So it was a survival camp training is what we were going to do.
796
There was an instructor and it wasn't completely irresponsible, but it was find your own water, build your own shelter, boil it, start your own fire.
797
That was a fun one.
798
Another fun one, and that was to celebrate New Year's.
799
Another fun one was she would drop us in the in the middle of the city, as this is Mexico City.
800
She says she would then just leave us alone.
801
I don't remember.
802
I think she was just following us, but it would be, you have to get back home and you have to know public transit or ask someone for help and basically solve problems.
803
She would send us on international trips also alone.
804
So I think there were many things that she did.
805
She called it independence.
806
She wanted us to be independent.
807
I think the term that we could use now is agency, solve your problems, just go and get things and get things done.
808
So, I think that was also very formative of the way I am and I approach different problems.
809
Do you feel she might have been training you to be a spy?
810
Maybe.
811
We also did a lot of skiing, biking, trekking, and also the action parts of the spy experience.
812
We used to tease her still that she didn't enjoy activities that didn't have a liability release before you did them.
813
So, yeah, Rappel, climbing.
814
We had a very fun childhood.
815
This explains a lot.
816
I feel I could do another hour just diving into your childhood and what made you who you are today, but maybe we'll save that for part two.
817
I feel we've done a great job giving people a sense of just how interesting you are as a person and also just the uniqueness of Mercado Libre and what they've built in the business that you help run.
818
Is there anything else that we haven't touched on that you think might be helpful to folks or that you want to leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lightning round?
819
I think we covered a lot.
820
I was also happy to be able to share.
821
No, Mercado Libre doesn't operate in the US.
822
I think that's the main reason why it's not such a well-known tech company.
823
I think it's changing with the stock growing as well.
824
It helps.
825
A lot of people know it from investing and being very happy with the performance.
826
So, thank you for letting me share some of what we do and some of what I've been doing.
827
Absolutely.
828
And with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round.
829
I've got five questions for you.
830
Are you ready?
831
I'm ready.
832
What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?
833
This is a good one.
834
I think it depends on the person that I'm recommended to.
835
I try to make it relevant to what they're doing.
836
If we go statistically, it's usually within the company.
837
So management-related high-output management I think is a great one.
838
But I also have been recently recommending people read The Odyssey.
839
It's a super, super inspiring story.
840
It's not a coincidence that it's survived for thousands of years.
841
It's a really fun read and something that just resonates with a lot of people.
842
Another book that I really is called The Dream Machine.
843
And it's the story of computers and computing and the internet.
844
And for example, why is Ethernet called Ethernet?
845
There was AlohaNet before.
846
So I think that's also a great one to understand some of the things that we rely on.
847
And these we stand in the shoulders of giants constantly to build the things we do.
848
I think that's another great one.
849
Because the rest are probably more fiction.
850
And I love Dune, I love science fiction and what you would expect.
851
Okay.
852
This next question.
853
I know you don't watch TV, so let me just ask: is there a favorite recent movie that you've watched that you really enjoyed?
854
Yeah, yeah.
855, recent, I don't go to the movies as often as I used to since I had kids.
856
But sometimes we go with them.
857
But I think probably the last one that resonated with me or that I thought was awesome was Everything Everywhere All At Once.
858
Just really fun movie, great acting, low budget.
859
I didn't know when I watched it at the time.
860
I did research on it later.
861
That one was super fun.
862
Dune, I enjoyed it a lot because I the books.
863
It's one of my favorite books.
864
But I do watch children's shows from time to time.
865
I'm sure someone has probably mentioned Bluey already, but it's amazing.
866
It's really well made for the kids, for the parents.
867
Great messages, great animation.
868
That's just a gem that I really recommend.
869
Yeah, Bluey does come up a bunch.
870
I feel it's one of the more mentioned shows.
871
You interview a lot of parents as well, Ben.
872
I guess I do.
873
And I'm a new parent, so you think that I'm pulling them in.
874
Okay, do you have a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really love?
875
Yeah, this one's going to be fun for you as well as a parent.
876
I'm not sure if you've heard of Mendava.
877
It's a new way of teaching kids to read.
878
Oh, the company.
879
Okay, yes.
880
Say more.
881
Yeah, yeah.
882
So,, it's a product and it's great.
883
I did it with my son and I quote unquote taught him how to read using the program.
884
And now he's probably the top reader in his class.
885
How old is he?
886
So he's five.
887
It's designed for three, four, five-year-olds.
888
So he's probably late to the reading early bandwagon because I haven't really seen strong evidence that it changes outcomes in the future.
889
The best argument I've seen for it from Matt Bateman, and I'm not sure if you're familiar with him, but he's great on education and Montessori, is that it can lead to a very enjoyable childhood if you can read early.
890
So, if you're a four-year-old, a five-year-old that can read very well, you'll have a fun childhood with access to a lot more information.
891
So, for us, it wasn't reading early, it was just making sure you have a really good fundamental on reading because it's just a base skill that propagates to the rest.
892
And in that pain,, Beast Academy for Math is another great one that I would recommend to parents.
893
That one's great.
894
And maybe the last product I would mention: David Protein Bars.
895
They're very good.
896
I really weightlifting.
897
It's one of the things I do to get my blood flowing.
898
Super high-quality ingredients, very high protein.
899
I think it's a venture-backed company.
900
I haven't talked to the founders, but reach out.
901
I would love to meet you.
902
You guys are doing some good fun.
903
So, I think those are the ones that come to mind.
904
3D printers are also fun.
905
I made a telescope with my son a couple of months ago.
906
That was very fun.
907
There's a lot of new products now.
908
It's a fun time to be alive.
909
This is your category right here: cool, fun gadgets and products.
910
I feel this could be another hour of podcasting.
911
Probably.
912
Okay, two more questions.
913
One, do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to find useful in work or in life?
914
That life and the world are malleable.
915
Things aren't as set in stone as you would think.
916
There's usually a way to get what you're after.
917
You have to be careful, I think, about what you want because if you have enough agency, you can probably get quote-unquote anything.
918
So, make sure you're looking for something good and that you're going to be happy with the result.
919
But that's probably the main one.
920
I've heard it phrased in many different ways.
921
Steve Jobs said of, well,, the world was built by people you, me, some of them not smarter than you, some of them maybe smarter than you.
922
So you can just go out and do things.
923
This is a new meme, no, and the world will probably reconfigure itself to help you, which is that one's from Mark Andreessen.
924
Yeah, just understanding that you can change the world.
925
It doesn't have to be in a massive way.
926
It's also possible just in not just getting locked down to, well,, this is how it's done, or this is a culture here, or this is how it's always been done.
927
I think we can change whatever we want.
928
What I'm hearing is your mom's goal of instilling agency in you work.
929
I would say so.
930
Yes, I have fun solving problems.
931
Just finding your way home from the center of Mexico City worked.
932
Final question: A colleague of yours, maybe friend Christopher Lazarus, wanted me to ask you about something called the Tatami project.
933
Does that ring a bell?
934
Talk about what that was.
935
Yeah, yeah, that's from a long time ago.
936
So you did your very good research.
937
Yeah, talking about agency, at some point I wanted to have what's called, I think it's called Tammy Room.
938
I'm not an expert, but basically a room in your house where you have Tatamis and you can meditate there or train or practice.
939
My room, my childhood bedroom, was strange in that it had a basement.
940
So, two floors, you could open a hatch on the floor and go down.
941
I think it was a thing from how the house was built.
942
I decided that that was the best place for putting the tatamis, but I didn't want to have a roof on top of that.
943
So, I went and bought construction gear and huge diamond cutters and cut a big hole in the middle of my room, put a stair and put the tatamis underneath.
944
So, I turned my room into a two-floor loft, which was pretty fun.
945
I hadn't thought about that in a while.
946
I used to do a lot of hacker projects and maker things, and I love using my hands, I love building products, technology, code, but also physical things.
947
Had a lot of fun with Arduinos and building tiny robots.
948
Yeah, that's a fun memory.
949
But I did put a hole in the middle of my room.
950
My parents were always happy with us having projects.
951
I was gonna ask, how did your mom feel about this?
952
I don't think they were thinking about the future sale value of the house or whatnot.
953
It turned out to be a thing people were interested.
954
They didn't sell the house, but they used to rent it.
955
And I was, well, this is strange.
956
Maybe we'll put something here.
957
And it turned out to be a good decision.
958
But they were very open to us exploring and making mistakes.
959
I think going back even to the start of our conversation on how to not get stuck as a big company, as a big team.
960
You need to make mistakes and take risks.
961
And that's something that was always encouraged by my parents.
962
That is a hilarious story.
963
And just to be clear, it's a Tami mat.
964
It's a thin mattress, basically.
965
So a tatami is not something you would sleep on directly, but it's made out of bamboo.
966 if you Google for just a Japanese house, what they have on the floor is a tatami block.
967
So they'll put two, three, five, ten together.
968
So it's that green floor that you see in many traditional hotels or photos.
969
So I made a miniature version of that in the newly added second floor of my room.
970
Sebas, this was everything I was hoping it'd be.
971
We covered so much ground, you, the company, things you've learned.
972
I feel we could do another follow-up with just as many insights and lessons and stories.
973
But other than that, two final questions.
974
Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more?
975
And how can listeners be useful to you?
976
Perfect.
977
I am not so active on Twitter.
978
I mostly read and find interesting ideas, but happy to see you there.
979
LinkedIn is another one.
980
I know some people who are very into X and Twitter don't LinkedIn a lot, but I think both work and they'll both have their place.
981
So yeah, happy to connect and feel free to reach out.
982
Something that I love about the tech industry, you can just do things, just reach out to people and they'll probably be helpful and help you.
983
That has certainly been the case with me.
984
And I'm also happy to do that for anyone who has any question or wants to connect.
985
