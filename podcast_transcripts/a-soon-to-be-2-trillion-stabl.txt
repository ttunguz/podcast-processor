Today's guest is Vicki Foo, co-founder at yala and former engineering director at circle welcome vicky thank you thank you for having me it's great pleasure to have a conversation here yeah yeah excited to chat there's been so much stablecoin news this week and last there was obviously the circle ipo that most crypto people uh kind of missed or or dismissed and you were one of the few who understood that people were underestimating it then this week there was the plasma ico the privy acquisition by stripe and the announcement that shopify merchants would now be able to accept usdc and that is only the business news on top of all that it looks like we're going to get a stablecoin bill passed in the senate soon so i know people want to hear about the privy acquisition the shopify news but i do just want to back up and start with the circle ipo because that really sets the stage for how to think about all of this news that we're seeing and the day before the circle ipo you wrote a tweet saying that it was mispriced and the market was going to learn a lesson about this you know you probably heard like a lot of crypto people were comparing circle's business model to tethers and frankly the profits which you know are just a small fraction of tether's and um you know they have much higher overhead and so there were numerous crypto people in fact on this show who were saying you know this ipo is nothing to get excited about and they were wrong and you had written this tweet about you know how you felt people were mispricing this so explain you know what it was that you were thinking how you were evaluating things differently and why you thought the underwriters got it wrong but thank you.
29
I really appreciate you noticed my my tweet i i didn't expect it to have so much attention um i i like let me start with my my story and my journey.
30
So I joined Circle 2021 and left 2024, early 2024 as an engine director and started my own project, YALA, which is a BDC-backed liquidity layer to help BDC holder in EO.
31
So I view myself really have thought a lot about the stablecoin business.
32
I see that people right now is try to try to do the traditional way for like a financial model, say, oh, this is the earning, so this is the profit.
33
So how do you measure this company?
34
Actually, Circle is so unique.
35
It actually created a brand new business or brand new product never seen before, right?
36
Before we don't have a stablecoin as a public trade company.
37
So that's the first initial thing that Circle pioneered.
38
Actually, in 2021, when I joined, Circle already started an IPO journey.
39
It has been overdue because the regulation, because a lot of going on for the crypto side get involved.
40
So finally, we get to the point, we get the SCE approved this deal, we get Circle accepted as a public trade company.
41
A lot of new attention comes here.
42
But overall, I think Circle really pioneered here of two things people didn't pay much attention beyond the revenue.
43
One is Circle spring significant of the liquidity everywhere on chain.
44
What I mean that right now everyone can bring a stablecoin more or less every bank.
45
I mean talk about every bank in the regulation or something.
46
But as a circle's volume, I think right now is a 60 billion circulation.
47
You have to deploy those liquidity in all the DeFi protocol from the trading, from the staking, from everywhere else.
48
That's where a lot of natural organic demand, which not any other stablecoin easy to compare.
49
Of course, Tether is there.
50
I think that's also legit.
51
They are also a big player.
52
So that's where I think when people only compare to revenue perspective, they easily miss what's going on and the needs.
53
Where's the 60 billion come from?
54
60 billion circulation.
55
That's the first thing.
56
The second thing is when people compare Tether and the Circle, they always feel that, oh, because the revenue is small, that means like the Circle seems second here compared to Tether.
57
I think that that's totally misunderstood business.
58
Because Circle or Tether, they are representing a brand new business, means they do on-round off-ramp representing the whole geomarket.
59
What I mean is a circle really are dominant in North America or have been a long time regulation when they are not certain.
60
People feel like they should not invest a lot in crypto space.
61
But given that the whole climate change after Trump gets into position, the US market, all the North American market will be invested significantly.
62
And the Circle will be their top choice when they think about a stablecoin initiative they should bet on or given that Circle have a really strong brand in US.
63
That's what will fundamentally boost all the Circle's circulation and the positive capability.
64
So I think when they just say, oh, because they have less circulation compared to Tether, it's just not in the same market.
65
So that's where I think given that two things, beyond the number, look at the overall market condition and all DeFi infra, Circle should work significantly more compared to the $31 as the starting price.
66
Okay, so basically, you're in a way just saying, like, because the US has the biggest markets, that that is, and that's where Circle plays, that that's why it ends up having this competitive edge.
67
And it really is just a different beast from Tether, which is trying to serve a completely different market.
68
Is that kind of what you're saying?
69
I view that potentially US was the faster growing space in crypto given that right now the regulation favorite the US investment place.
70
So I think the last few years, US are underdeveloped when we talk about the crypto growing.
71
That's where I see that the new government really think we want to be crypto friendly.
72
I'm really happy to see that and I'm really happy to see Circle success.
73
A lot of friends of mine are really celebrating this IPO.
74
And given the IPO, Circle have even stronger brand and there'll be more adoption accordingly because Stablecoin is a trust game and people view transparency as one of the top requirements when they put their money.
75
So that's where I think Circle will have even further growing potential given that.
76
Okay.
77
Yeah, that makes sense.
78
One of the probably longest standing criticisms of Tether is around transparency.
79
But yeah, I just wanted to quote from that tweet that you wrote because it was funny.
80
You know, here we are talking about how a lot of crypto people were kind of comparing the profits to Tether's and the profit margins.
81
And you just wrote, you know, so you talked about how you felt like the valuations that people were talking about and the price that the IPO was going to launch at, how you felt like that was what you called structural mispricing.
82
And then you wrote, Circle isn't a money market fund.
83
It's a digital dollar infrastructure with quasi-sovereign issuance rights.
84
For context, PayPal, $70 billion market cap, $1.5 trillion in volume.
85
Visa, $500 billion market cap, $14 trillion in volume.
86
Circle, $6 billion valuation, $12 trillion in volume.
87
So that was, yeah, it was a really interesting comparison.
88
And you said the math doesn't work.
89
25 times oversubscribed tells the real story.
90
And actually, one other bit that I wanted to ask you about in this tweet, you said Circle controls the digital dollar printing press.
91
And, you know, as you had mentioned earlier in the tweet, you said that they're really in this area where it's like a quasi-sovereign issuance rights.
92
But I just wanted to understand because it's not like they're like creating dollars.
93
They're like taking analog dollars and turning them into digital.
94
So really, how are you thinking about what this business is?
95
Yeah, yeah.
96
I think this is people easily underestimated the effort Circle built and what's the mold here.
97
Because in the end of the day, fiat-based stablecoin actually do a lot for on-run, off-ran, right?
98
Because you want to deposit the US dollars then in the stables and burn US dollar, burn USDC, get your dollar back.
99
So Circle catering that with real-time and 24x7 capability.
100
Why I say it's a big deal because I don't know people remember 2022, 2022 or 2022 or 23, the Silicon Valley falling apart at that time.
101
Silicon Valley Bank.
102
Yeah, yeah, it was March 2023.
103
2023, Silicon Valley Bank falling apart.
104
At that time, Circle lose the bank on-run off-run rail some portion from the Civilgate.
105
So Circle worked really hard to bring the global capability to do on-run off-rank since then, right?
106
Because this is really allow globally everyone, if they bring US dollars, they actually can mean stable.
107
That's super powerful because dealing with bank relationship or building the capability to do real-time and handling the report and do three-way accounting for make sure every dollar on-chain, online, and in the bank are all meet.
108
This is actually a huge effort for Circle work really hard to get that point and make the transparency for everyone be able to see.
109
So that's I view that it's a last mile issue Circle has solved.
110
I think when people when people think about it, oh, you just deposit US dollar, you get a USB C, that's because Circle are solving this and keep it to bring new geo available like Latino and others.
111
So, that's give Circle a significant advantage compared to other RNA offering solutions.
112
Because if you think about it, any bank, either they can support their own current region or they somehow have the high cost due to their network.
113
So, Circle work very hard to bring that efficiency.
114
That's where really trillion dollars moving around cross-border payment be able to happen with a stable speed.
115
And that's where Jimmy Lair, the Circle CEO, have the vision: this is the future money movement, right?
116
Because that's the efficiency.
117
And any bank right now, their traditional infra could be empowered by stablecoins with better efficiency.
118
Given that, that's a significant amount of value pop from Circle can offer.
119
So, Circle right now are partnered with a lot of new brands, a lot of strong brands.
120
So, we actually will see this happen more and more.
121
So, that's where I think it will be tremendous value Socrat brings compared to like a Visa or PayPal given the more traditional way.
122
Yeah, yeah.
123
And we'll talk about that in a moment.
124
But first, we'll take a quick word from the sponsors who make the show possible.

Here's another listener comment responding to my interview with Jeff Park.
144
On X, Tatchi Intern said, Wild how many of these shifts feel obvious in hindsight and still get ignored in real time.
145
Again, if you want your take featured on the show, please write a review or leave a comment on an episode on YouTube, Farcaster, or X.
146
Back to my conversation with Vicki.
147
So, this is the perfect segue to talk about the big news that was released on Thursday afternoon, which is that Coinbase, Shopify, and Stripe will now be enabling Shopify merchants to accept payments in USDC, including payments using USDC on base.
148
What did you make of this news?
149
I see that consider all other acquisition happens from Stripe, it all comes to the place as more info is building up for supporting the stablecoin payment.
150
I think that all stablecoin as a settlement settlement vehicle actually can be solved each scenario problem with right info.
151
So, that's where actually those kind of things are growing.
152
So, server played a central role, actually, have a network effect.
153
That's where Coinbase payments are using USDC as a settlement.
154
That makes perfect sense.
155
I'm super excited to see that to empower like retail shopping and help people have more better payment solutions with the cheaper cars.
156
Yeah, and just to make it clear, you know, Shopify has over 2 million merchants.
157
So, this is clearly just like a really big entry point, I think, for Americans and both businesses and consumers.
158
So, the other big news is a little bit related because, you know, as I mentioned, Stripe was part of that Coinbase and Shopify announcement.
159
And this week, we also saw news that Stripe had acquired Privy Wallet, which in and of itself is kind of one of the new crypto wallets that has gotten a lot of uptake.
160
They have over 75 million accounts, and this is the wallet that's embedded into Hyperliquid, Farcaster, OpenSea, and other apps.
161
And on top of that, you know, Stripe last year had acquired infrastructure.
162
Yeah, stablecoin infrastructure company Bridge for $1.1 billion.
163
So what's your big takeaways about the Privy acquisition?
164
I think like a Stripe block actually representing the payment info.
165
I see that this is the signal is they accept the stablecoin as a payment solution for them to be able to offer more efficiency with their merchants.
166
I think this is a super good news for people in this space and also a validation for us that more and more stablecoin payment solution will adopt.
167
And also for normal user you and me, we might see more app powered by like USDC as a payment solution easy to pay between you and me in an easy way, like a way more or even fancy than that.
168
Even AI agent could use the stablecoin USDC as a payment solution permissionlessly without any notice.
169
That will be a mainstream adoption without much harder setting by us, like figure out how to set a wallet and figure out where we store the recover key or something like that.
170
I expect Stripe or Coinbase, even Circle, they are building some payment network as well.
171
They will make an effort and make a massive adoption by providing a better user experience with the info they're building.
172
I think that this is the trend.
173
Yeah, yeah.
174
And, you know, one point that I just wanted to also make about the Shopify thing, which I went to mention earlier, is just, you know, we were talking about Circle, and it goes to show kind of what you were saying about this focus in the US.
175
This potentially could be quite big because if this is the coin that's being used for those payments, then that will definitely increase the transaction volume.
176
You know, one other thing that I just wanted to ask you more generally is like, you know, Stripe, they are making all these stablecoin moves.
177
And I just wondered what you kind of made of looking at all of it together, like where that is going for them or where you feel like this is fitting into their strategy.
178
Yeah, I think definitely it fits their strategy because Stripe view themselves as a payment info, right?
179
As a part of offer, the merchant upgrade the cheaper, the efficient solution, especially a lot of merchants may not US-based, right?
180
And also when they are global-based, cross-border payment, like foreign exchange are all the need to be solved in a more efficient way.
181
That's actually the advantage for stablecoin, be able to help those with lower fee, faster settlement.
182
So that's where I think where all the think tag should be see this as a true goal solution, right?
183
They will focus more on build a new network.
184
That's also the early wise Strife acquire bridge, right?
185
Because they want a new network with stablecoin run permissionless to be able to help with the settlement.
186
That's basically, I feel this is the trend.
187
Similar with the AI agent helps with AI technology, stablecoin helps payment technology.
188
I think this is like what's really exciting to see this.
189
So to see this upgrade, everyone should be able to get benefits from those.
190
Yeah, so the last big piece of news that I wanted to chat with you about on the business side is the Plasma ICO, which raised $500 million in, I think it was like maybe an hour-ish via an ICO.
191
And the original target had been for $50 million.
192
And then they raised it to $250 million.
193
And then they ended up raising $500 million.
194
So what was interesting to me is, you know, I was trying to figure out what this XPL token, what you can do with it, because this is meant to be, Plasma is meant to be a Bitcoin sidechain that's purpose-built for stablecoins, but also compatible with the EVM.
195
And, you know, I was wondering, so, okay, so like, if you own XPL, then what are you getting?
196
But, you know, despite, at least to me, just like in a, it's not like I did a super deep dive, but just from some of the, you know, more cursory things I was looking at online, it just felt like, you know, this is capitalizing on a few different trends here.
197
Like, like obviously, stablecoins, you know, I think ICOs are coming back.
198
But what did it say to you that this particular ICO was such a hot ticket?
199
Yeah, I think the observation is basically primary institution participating.
200
I think because when I look at the number, it's about a thousand wallets participating in that billion pool for the deposit.
201
So primary is come from large check, large deposit.
202
So in that way, I think the institution are really bullish in the stablecoin info.
203
That's right now the hardest topic.
204
And the circle, given that it is more work on Wall Street, and in that way, IPO is paying that portion of the investment money.
205
And this is for on-chain, take a big check from people who are using USDT to do the deposit could come from people not to be able to access IPO or like international, or especially I see that Tether actually have some investment in this as well.
206
So I think everyone is figuring out a way to help to build up the info, right?
207
Because I see their mission is the sidechain helps with the performance issue, with the speed, help with the stablecoin movement settlement with the faster speed.
208
So that's what they're offering.
209
With those kind of institutions, put a lot of money.
210
I expect they should have a good ecosystem built up quickly because everyone contributed their token.
211
In this way, I think if you look at blockchain or crypto business, they just significantly faster to raise money compared to traditional way, right?
212
Because Circle has been 12 years.
213
Finally, IPO raises so much money, it never issue any tokens beyond USDC as for just the stablecoin business.
214
So that's the hard way.
215
And right now, given that everyone have the concerns, the stablecoin business is a good business.
216
So I think a lot of new money will come to this place to bet on different info piece as long as they can solve some scenario or some problems they realize could grow.
217
So I think all this is really good for us.
218
Same as YALA, we are Bitcoin-backed stablecoin to able to help users to earn yield with the liquidity coming from the Bitcoin.
219
That's another angle, right?
220
Because Circle has built a significant amount of info from the unreal friend banker relationship to bring the fiat money into crypto.
221
On the other side, Bitcoin is totally decentralized.
222
We want to have the info to help the Bitcoin get more liquidity to make a yield for the Bitcoin holder.
223
There are liquidity there from the Bitcoin asset.
224
So this is totally different info.
225
We view that stablecoin will be a bigger business to everyone can solve some portion of problems, then this could be help the whole financial system upgrade to a new level and get more transparent and more efficient.
226
Okay.
227
And then, you know, last question.
228
So here we have this stablecoin bill going through the Senate.
229
It looks like it will probably be passed sometime soon.
230
And then hopefully we'll actually have a legislation that will arrive on President Trump's desk and hopefully it will be signed.
231
But what that is causing is like a bunch of other players to also take notice that this sector is poised to take off.
232
And so we are seeing Society General is the first major bank that's going to launch a dollar peg stablecoin.
233
It looks like even DTCC is trying to get in on this.
234
And we've done some interviews here where other analysts have said to us that they feel like once big banks get in, like once there's a stablecoin on JP Morgan, that I think the one term that this person used is that the big banks could crush Circle.
235
So I'd be curious to hear your thoughts about how Circle or really any of these other stablecoin players could fare against competition with big banks.
236
Yeah, I think last few years there's a lot of trying, right?
237
Because the PayPal have a stablecoin for a little bit more than one year, I think more than one year, about a billion range.
238
I'm really happy to see everyone try to build themselves up with some stablecoin because, like earlier, shared, it's really solved the efficiency problems.
239
Like, for example, any bank, even using the stablecoin rather than their own, like to rewrite the info part, could be much more efficient for all the transparency and efficiency for the operation part.
240
So that's where I think it's a significant value for everyone to adopt a stablecoin.
241
On the other side, you feel some people may think that this could be a challenge for Circle.
242
Actually, I think the opposite.
243
The reason for that is the $60 billion circulation Circle built is the two part.
244
One is the liquidity comes in all chains.
245
A lot of chains adopt right now.
246
So I think I have 20 chains we'll talk about integrated, and on top of that, all the decentralized exchange or all the liquidity providers are using USDC in some kind of way to do the liquidity.
247
So that's where it's the network effect Circle has built is not easy to replace, right?
248
Bank of America, you have, or any bank, I should not say Bank of America, any new bank have a stable.
249
I don't think like Solana were directly adopted because if they see that they use USDC, it's easier to trade.
250
One data I can share when Trump issued the mean token about Trump happens early this year, they actually mean $1 billion USDC on Solana because people think this is the liquidity come from.
251
Use this can have a trading best on Solana.
252
So that's part.
253
I don't think the traditional bank, no matter how many stablecoins they issue, can replace that.
254
And on the other side is the unreference globally support.
255
US can offer that, but if you talk about a global scale, people using the check from like Europe or Africa or anywhere, can they mean the stable?
256
Because this is actually user experience problem and which the central exchange will accept it.
257
So have really good relationship with Coinbase.
258
Everyone knows that the partnership have been together.
259
And that's where retail can easily get a USDC to dollar, dollar to USDC.
260
And it's the negro effect Soha build with their EU assistance.
261
So I think it's totally opposite.
262
Every bank, if they want to have liquidity, they need to rely on USDC or USDT2 to help with their liquidity when they're using, when they are be online, have more use cases around them.
263
Okay, well, it was so great chatting with you.
264

Securities and Exchange Commission has asked several asset managers seeking to launch Solana Exchange Traded Funds to revise their S1 filings, a move seen as a potential step toward approval.
286
According to sources cited by Blockworks and Bloomberg, the SEC is focused on two critical issues: whether the ETFs will permit in-kind redemptions using Sol tokens and how they will handle staking, a feature that allows token holders to earn rewards by validating blockchain transactions.

At least seven firms, including Grayscale, Fidelity, Vanec, and 21 Shares, are in the running to bring Solana ETFs to market.

A spokesperson for 21 Shares confirmed to Blockworks it had received feedback and plans to submit an amended filing shortly.
289
Bloomberg analysts estimate a 90% chance of approval this year, possibly as early as July.

The regulators' engagement is widely seen as a sign that a new wave of crypto ETFs may be nearing launch.

SEC floats DeFi innovation exemption.
311
Paul Atkins, the US SEC chair, instructed staff to explore a new innovation exemption aimed at easing regulatory burdens for decentralized finance platforms.
312
Speaking at the DeFi and the American Spirit Roundtable, Atkins outlined a vision to allow developers and intermediaries to launch on-chain services more freely while ensuring compliance with key safeguards.
313
The exemption would not eliminate oversight, but could streamline the path to market for DeFi projects that meet certain conditions.
314
Atkins emphasized that publishing open source code should not be treated as a regulated financial activity, citing First Amendment protections.
315
The right to have self-custody of one's private property is a foundational American value, he said.
316
Following the remarks, DeFi tokens, including AAV, Uni, and Sky, surged more than 20%, reflecting a wave of optimism.

He posted, citing Foundation co-chair Josh Stark.

Bitcoin update to expand data storage sparks debate.

344
Supporters say the change could open doors for new applications, but critics warn it risks overloading the network.

Developer Luke Dash Gere sharply criticized the move, saying it enables denial of service attacks, referring to data-heavy transactions like inscriptions.
346
In a separate development, Bitcoin Core reaffirmed its position on neutrality in a public statement.

The team wrote: This is not endorsing or condoning non-financial data usage, but accepting that as a censorship-resistant system, Bitcoin can and will be used for use cases not everyone agrees on.

SUI-based DEX relaunches after HAC.
361
CEDAS, a decentralized exchange operating on the SUI and Aptos blockchains, has relaunched its protocol just over two weeks after a major exploit drained its liquidity pools.
362
The May 22 attack, caused by a flaw in a shared math library, allowed an attacker to inflate token deposits and siphon off funds, ultimately compromising over $220 million.
363
In a controversial step aimed at recovering the lost funds, CEDAS managed to freeze $162 million of the stolen assets with the help of SUI validators.
364
The protocol also secured a $30 million USDC loan from the SUI Foundation and tapped into $7 million in reserves to help restore affected pools.
365
Liquidity providers are now seeing reimbursement rates between 85% and 99%, with full recovery expected through a token-based compensation plan.
366
15% of the CEDAS token supply has been allocated, with 5% immediately claimable and the rest unlocking over a year.
367
CEDAS says it is strengthening its security and pursuing the attacker through legal channels.

BitGlobal ends legal battle with Coinbase.
369
BitGlobal has officially dropped its lawsuit against Coinbase, closing the chapter on a high-profile dispute tied to the delisting of Wrapped Bitcoin, WBTC.
370
Filed in December 2024, the lawsuit alleged that Coinbase's removal of 13.8 billion BTC unfairly harmed the token's market position in favor of its own product, CBBTC.
371
The suit sought over $1 billion in damages.
372
The case was dismissed with prejudice, meaning BitGlobal cannot revive the same claims in the future.
373
Both parties agreed to cover their own legal expenses.
374
Coinbase had cited security concerns over BitGlobal's ties to Tron founder Justin Sun, stating the decision was based on unacceptable risk to customers.
375
A judge previously denied BitGlobal's request to halt the delisting, and transcripts show the court had been leaning toward dismissing the case altogether.

Hacker turns Paraguay's president into Bitcoin Maxi.
378
In a plot twist, straight out of crypto fanfiction, the ex-account of Paraguay's president Santiago Peña was hijacked and briefly transformed him into Bitcoin's biggest cheerleader.
379
The hacked post claimed Paraguay was adopting Bitcoin as legal tender, launching BTC bonds, and even accepting donations to a wallet address.
380
Bonus red flag, the whole thing was written in English.
381
A bit odd for a Spanish-speaking president who always posts in Spanish.
382
The real presidency quickly clarified it was all bogus.
383
No Bitcoin bonds, no legal tender law, and definitely no presidential fundraising wallet.
384
Nice try, Hacker, and that's all.
