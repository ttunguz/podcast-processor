--- METADATA END ---

1
Former F1 driver, champion in 2016.
2
He's getting into the venture business.
3
Please welcome Nico.
4
They started the season with 20 drivers and they would end the season with only 18 of them left.
5
Wow.
6
What was the craziest shit you've ever been involved in?
7
Well, my rival was my teammate.
8
So unfortunately, it really becomes like an enemy in a way.
9
What were your first few deals?
10
11 labs, for example.
11
Holy shit.
12
Good for you.
13
This used to be an extremely dangerous sport.
14
You had people dying every year in these tiny little cars with no roll cages, et cetera.
15
But over time, it's become incredibly safe.
16
The number of people dying went from, you know, a couple dozen a year in the 50s, 60s, 70s, and now it's gotten incredibly safe.
17
How scary is it to drive in those cars?
18
And how do you get over that fear of death?
19
First of all, hello, everybody.
20
That's a pretty intense start to the conversation.
21
You're interviewing Jacob.
22
No, I mean, I got to get right to it.
23
How are you still alive?
24
Yeah, Helen.
25
How are you?
26
Why haven't you died yet?
27
Yeah.
28
I looked at that car.
29
Why is there no canopy on it?
30
Why aren't your head exposed?
31
It's so crazy what you're doing or what you did.
32
So, no, you're absolutely right.
33
And I know better than most people also because my father actually was a Formula One racer.
34
Yeah.
35
And he was a world champion.
36
And a champion.
37
I didn't want to say, but yes, he was also world champion.
38
But you were.
39
Sorry, I asked you backstage.
40
You're one of only two father-son world champions of all time.
41
That's true, yeah.
42
Pretty incredible.
43
Which is very special.
44
So, I mean, your dad's out there racing.
45
You're at home with mom, I assume.
46
This has got to be terrifying to watch your dad do this.
47
So in his day, they started the season with 20 drivers and they would end the season with only 18 of them left.
48
So it was a 10% chance, more or less.
49
I mean, what then?
50
If you do an eight-year career, like, what are your odds?
51
Like, that's not looking very good.
52
So, there, to your point.
53
Yeah, it was a death every 100,000 miles.
54
Now, it's a death every six, seven million miles.
55
I was very lucky because by the time I came in, they had carbon fiber chassis, they had rolled, they have a roll hoop now, you know, and this protection, this halo around your head, which recently saved a couple of lives in the last five years.
56
Because Max Verstapen, who's now the four-time world champion at the moment, he landed on Lewis Hamilton's head in Italy with the full car, and it was this halo that saved Lewis Hamilton's life.
57
So, we're very, very lucky how the sport has progressed with the safety.
58
How did you start driving?
59
How old were you?
60
Because I didn't realize yesterday.
61
I go into the suite that we have, and they say this kid is 18 years old as a driver.
62
I had no idea that kids that young were driving.
63
How old were you when you started?
64
And at what point did you start to become competitive?
65
So, it's a bit like with every sport that you have to start very, very young.
66
I started, I was six, started go-karting, I was six, and then racing 10 years old.
67
Now, they start racing when they're eight years old.
68
So, Antonelli, who was on pole position yesterday, the 18-year-old, he started racing, he was eight.
69
He was in my go-karting team when he was 12.
70
So, I know him very, very well.
71
And he is a generational talent, but it's very early for him because he's only 18.
72
And he took over the car of the greatest of all time.
73
Lewis Hamilton left Mercedes to go to Ferrari, and Antonelli took this car from Lewis Hamilton.
74
That is insane.
75
So if we had to design some kind of a model, could you define the features that he had when he was six, seven, or eight years old that could have predicted how good it was?
76
Like is it the Metachlorian?
77
Well, Anakin Skywalker was really good at that.
78
I don't know me.
79
And then they tested the Minichlian.
80
He was a specialist on Star Wars lore.
81
The Metachlorian.
82
But defining the Geo.
83
Do you think that you could design something where people, kids, could come and take some kind of test?
84
You look at your reflexes or your eye twitch speed or the way your brain works.
85
And is there a pattern, do you think, that is genetically predisposes some people to just be exceptional?
86
So we've not come to that point yet that we actually go through such tests, but I think there are a couple of things that would kind of satisfy that.
87
And one is your speed of processing, because in a race car, you're going at 220 miles an hour, and you have so many inputs flying at you, and not only visual, also sensual, everything, and also sound with the engine and everything.
88
And you have to process that so rapidly.
89
How did you train for that?
90
I even had a computer program, which I developed just for myself, actually, where I would have all these different inputs.
91
So audio, touch, tactile, have like a thing around here.
92
And even then visual on the computer.
93
And I would be catching these inputs and trying to break my record.
94
And the faster I would go, the faster the program would go.
95
So I was trying to develop these kind of things to train my brain to move faster and reaction to the brain.
96
So reaction time is the key skill set.
97
Is it also being courageous and like something with your amygdala where you don't have fear?
98
There's that, certainly, yeah.
99
I would say that I am actually someone who's quite fearful, but when you're in it, you kind of also get used to things, yeah, and you start to feel quite safe in the car nowadays because I'm not a crazy adrenaline drunkie, unlike most other drivers, actually out there.
100
Like, some of them.
101
You find that they are adrenaline junkie.
102
Yeah, like someone like Fer Stappen is fearless, like completely.
103
Or even Hamilton, you know, they're proper, quite nutcases.
104
The paths are a little different for everyone.
105
Yeah, there's different types of colours.
106
So, there's a great difference to the personality type.
107
Then, of course, there's hand-eye coordination.
108
So, to your point, Jamaat, for young kids, probably there's a high chance that you put a tennis racket in their hand, they'll also be pretty good very quickly.
109
And it's a similar set of skills.
110
Can we shift and talk a little bit about the business of Formula One?
111
I mean, we were talking backstage before the show a little bit, and you shared some of the anecdotes about some of the valuations and what's happened over the last decade, decade and a half.
112
Maybe you can just kind of paint a picture for us on how this has evolved as kind of a business and where things sit today, where they're headed, and what's driven that?
113
Yeah, so I'm a venture capitalist myself, and that's why I'm very interested in the business side of sport.
114
And F1 has gone through such an incredible inflection, and there's a couple of factors that have come into play.
115
They brought in budget caps for the teams.
116
So, the teams were spending just on their car development, like north of 200 million a year, and now it's like limited to 130 million a year just for the chassis itself, not excluding engine.
117
Nobody's.
118
The 130 million.
119
Two cars.
120
Two race cars per year.
121
Per year.
122
But that's just the chassis.
123
You then have the engine, which is another 70 million.
124
You then have the top driver who takes 50 million a year.
125
Or 100.
126
No, 100, no.
127
That was the first stop and rumor to go.
128
Yeah, plus marketing, plus plus, you get to maybe 70, 80, yeah.
129
So fielding a team is how much?
130
Fielding a team is around, you get close to 300 million.
131
Wow.
132
Yeah.
133
But you're saying that the budget cap allowed everything to kind of get away from.
134
Yes, because the budget cap brought in this cap for developing the chassis to 130 million.
135
Then suddenly Netflix also came in, and Netflix has just made the sport so much more popular, it's unbelievable.
136
So that theory, you really changed the land.
137
Just in the U.S., you've gone from in the last couple of six years, 20 million fans to like 50 million fans.
138
It's more than doubled, only in the US alone.
139
What do you think Netflix did right?
140
So Netflix, the owners of F1 are Liberty, which is a U.S., right?
141
It's a U.S.-based company.
142
And they did very well.
143
They opened up social media.
144
The new generation of drivers are really social media savvy and are like the fan base is 40% women in America.
145
How many women here today are F1 fans?
146
Well, there we go.
147
Okay, not too bad.
148
Are all the drivers as good looking as you or no?
149
No, I don't want to go into that kind of.
150
Don't be too yourself in Miami.
151
So the audience blew up.
152
The audience has blown up.
153
And you asked me what did they get right?
154
So what did they get right?
155
The Netflix show, for those of you who've seen it, it's documentary, like, hey, this guy won here.
156
But they managed to capture these personas behind the scenes.
157
And you really get to see the human beings behind the sport.
158
And that's very special.
159
And they tried to replicate it in other sports, like I think, golf and tennis.
160
And it didn't work out as well.
161
Because I think they got a little bit lucky also that here, quite a few characters allowed them and completely opened up and allowed Netflix to capture the real, intense behind-the-scenes moment.
162
And it's just fascinating to follow.
163
So that's what works.
164
So before, if you come in as an outsider, I had this experience: like, what team are you?
165
What you know, who you support?
166
Like, I'm not really sure, but once you get to know the personalities, you have a vested interest, you have a history, there's something that you can contextualize.
167
Let me just end on the business part.
168
Yes.
169
So teams, like 10 years ago, F1 teams were like worth $150 million.
170
Yeah, and they would lose $50 million a year.
171
And now the top teams go for $5 to $6 billion 10 years later.
172
It's like eye-watering.
173
It's incredible.
174
You can see each other when you're driving the race.
175
You try to bump into each other.
176
100%.
177
It's part of the game.
178
You have to, unfortunately.
179
Can you explain?
180
Because I'm a neophyte.
181
I don't understand it.
182
And I see once in a while these NASCAR guys pull over, they get out, they throw their helmets at each other.
183
You know, they get really upset.
184
They seem like, but they seem like hillbillies.
185
You guys seem like a bunch of Europeans.
186
And like, you guys seem like you're fancy, like a little more elegant.
187
What do you guys do?
188
Do you guys like spray Booth Clicot on each other or something?
189
How do you guys mess with each other?
190
People wouldn't like it.
191
So we had one guy push, it was first up and push.
192
That's as far as the physicality, but when you're in the car, yeah, it's fierce.
193
It's fierce.
194
So, take us through, like, what was the craziest sh you've ever been involved in, altercation-wise?
195
Well, my rival was my teammate.
196
My rival was Lewis Hamilton at the time.
197
We were both racing for Mercedes.
198
Any Lewis Hamilton fans here today?
199
A little bit, okay, I'm here, good.
200
Dr.
201
Nico, can you talk about that?
202
In that period, he's so dominant, but the car's so dominant, and then you win.
203
What is it like where you're teammates with your biggest competitor?
204
Like, what is that dynamic like, that psychological dynamic?
205
Are you friends?
206
Are you guys friends, or so?
207
With Lewis Hamilton, we were actually best friends when we were 14 years old.
208
We grew up racing together in the same team, best friends.
209
But when you get to F1, it's just so intense, and so much is at stake.
210
And if it's just the two of you racing for race games every single time, you can't stand him, you hate him.
211
Yeah, it goes into hating, yeah.
212
Yeah, like real hate.
213
I can see the contempt.
214
Do you talk during the week, or you don't even really interact?
215
No, you don't interact much.
216
So, unfortunately, it really becomes an enemy in a way, you know.
217
And internally, in your own team, it's a horrible dynamic.
218
Right.
219
Because also, even the rest of the team then needs to start to be neutral, they can't take any sides.
220
So, even when you win, it's not like everybody's like leaning in with you.
221
Mixed emotions.
222
It's really a tough situation.
223
So, it's like two people in the same project who can't stand each other, Friedberg.
224
Yeah, they keep working together.
225
Yeah, what am I going to say?
226
How much of that fed your decision to retire literally days after you won the that was a little I think that caught some people off guard.
227
Can you just tell us what happened?
228
I was in my prime and I won that championship, which for me was my dream come true.
229
And it was extremely intense.
230
Thank you.
231
It was extremely.
232
Thanks, mom.
233
I got one clap.
234
Thanks, mom from my mom today.
235
That was really good.
236
Perfect fan.
237
There you go, mom.
238
Yeah, it was extremely intense.
239
And for me, it just felt like the right moment to...
240
I had a young daughter at home, she was one-year-old, family.
241
Just felt like the right moment.
242
I was in one piece to your comment.
243
It's been dangerous.
244
And I just decided rationally, you know, I never wanted to exit on the way down.
245
That's something I definitely wanted to avoid.
246
I wanted to exit at the top.
247
And that was my moment.
248
And I decided to pull the trigger.
249
Has there been a good ROI for the car companies that have invested in F1 in that all this money that they spend, other than the notoriety, are they inventing things that we all use and see and interact with day to day in our own daily driving experience or not really?
250
So you probably will be driving an AMG at some point?
251
I had an AMG at one point.
252
There you go.
253
And there is tech from the F1 team in there now.
254
Okay.
255
From the for the hybrid level.
256
For Mercedes, yes.
257
There is a universal hybrid.
258
And yeah, every car car company will be benefiting.
259
But the return on investment is also in terms of marketing.
260
Mercedes, there's a calculated return on investment, which is two billion worth for their brand annually.
261
And they don't actually invest money anymore because the team is profitable now and highly profitable.
262
Like the these teams make two hundred, three hundred million dollars in profit every year.
263
Have we kind of peaked from your point of view?
264
Is the market and the valuation curve still being climbed?
265
There's still a lot of upside at the moment because this growth has just happened in the last five years.
266
And there's still, I mean, even America, there's still loads of growth potential, more races, there's licensing.
267
The sport hasn't really even tapped into that yet.
268
Do you think there's something about sports that are kind of more tuned to the way our brains now operate in a social media world, like a fast-paced world?
269
Like, you know, golf became live.
270
I mean, live really kind of changed the face of golf.
271
Baseball is obviously dead.
272
I mean, MLB has been on the decline for years in the United States.
273
Not saying anything negative about baseball.
274
I'm just saying that the viewership is going down.
275
No, no, no, no.
276
There's a lot of games, but there's also these conversations about basketball and at the NBA.
277
I'll tell you this crazy anecdote.
278
I was a co-owner of the Warriors.
279
I sold two years ago.
280
A friend of mine, a friend of ours, is in the market for a sports team.
281
And he went to Europe to look at a bunch of soccer teams.
282
And then we were all having dinner.
283
And his bankers produced this study that showed exactly this problem, which is young people, their attention span is shrinking.
284
As it shrinks, there are certain sports they just cannot watch anymore.
285
Cannot watch.
286
And it's totally correlated.
287
The negative viewership in baseball, the increase in the use of clips.
288
So people are willing to watch baseball.
289
Clips, they will not watch a baseball game to save their life.
290
People will watch basketball clips.
291
They won't watch basketball.
292
The NBA is moving to clips, yeah.
293
And so it's this weird construction.
294
But in some ways, F1 is very set up for this already, naturally, right?
295
People don't really watch the whole sport as much as they want to watch.
296
How long is this race on site?
297
It's not that long.
298
It's boring a lot.
299
It's never been a horrible thing, and it's not that long.
300
I mean, that's the thing about it.
301
But you guys also have a lot of data telemetry.
302
Like, you can feed that kind of anxious mind.
303
And there's no breaks.
304
It just goes.
305
I'm not sure if you have a point there, unfortunately.
306
But pretty diplomatic.
307
I was just trying to move the conversation.
308
No, what I can say is that our sport has the highest engagement rates across all sports, even comparing to NBA and everything.
309
But why is that?
310
I think there's just a huge hype at the moment.
311
And maybe, yes, maybe, okay, maybe a little bit.
312
It is fast-pacing.
313
There's incredible action scenes, like thrilling action.
314
There's huge crashes.
315
You don't want to get in the business.
316
Given your knowledge and your experience, you didn't want to be in the business.
317
Because you now have transitioned into venture capital.
318
How did you make that decision versus working in the business of Formula One?
319
Oh, great question.
320
Because, yeah, that's a good question.
321
So in Formula One, what jobs would have been left for me now after driving would be, for example, running a team.
322
But running a team is 24-7.
323
Like, you need full commitment.
324
You need to move to the UK.
325
All the teams are in the UK.
326
It's a full life dedication.
327
And I've done that, been there, done that.
328
Now I want more freedom in my life to define my calendar and everything and be at home more.
329
And so that job, for example, would not be a possibility, not something I want to do.
330
And then beyond that, yeah, you can be a driver manager, but even there, you need full commitment.
331
So tell us about this transition into tech and investing and venture.
332
And what was that journey and what attracted you to that?
333
I was always inspired by people like Elon Musk, who obviously you were talking about before, and those achievements that you have this idea, and then you achieve something which has impacts like millions of lives.
334
I just found that fascinating.
335
So, I always just wanted to pursue that path, so I started investing as an angel investor.
336
Hold on a second.
337
Oh, take it easy.
338
Angel investing.
339
What are you doing after the show?
340
Have you ever read the book Angel?
341
Phenomenal.
342
It's in 12 pages.
343
Yeah, I'll sign a comic book for Angel.
344
It's 84 pages.
345
What were your first few deals?
346
11 Labs, for example.
347
Good for you.
348
Yeah, that's gone really well.
349
How did you find that?
350
How did that come about?
351
I mean, I'm really putting an effort into this community as well.
352
I'm spending a lot of time in Silicon Valley, meeting everybody, and also connecting to the European corporate landscape.
353
So I'm bringing customers, revenues, connecting, building bridges.
354
Because there's a unique angle that I can bring, you know, thanks to my sports past.
355
So I've just built my way into it and built a reputation, and then you start getting the opportunities.
356
What themes, Nico, have you invested in that today you would not invest knowing what you know today?
357
Not the ones that are born.
358
Yeah, that's the flying taxis, the victuals, for example.
359
Yeah, Germany was leading the way on those.
360
You have Joby, for example, Joby Aviation, which is probably currently best positioned in the U.S.
361
But Germany was leading the way with two horses in the race, and both of them have run into trouble.
362
One is bankrupt, one was both bankrupt, I think.
363
So that's something that then in hindsight, you, of course, you would have known hardware is hard.
364
Right.
365
I would have avoided that.
366
You should have listened to that.
367
You should have gotten that chapter.
368
I should have listened.
369
I'm hearing now, like I have a, I invested also in a cyber e-scooter here in New York called Infranet Machine.
370
And now with the tariffs, because the supply chain is so brittle, concentrated in China, it's just, it's a complete mess.
371
Yeah.
372
Nico, what about the political landscape in Europe?
373
There was a pretty important election in Germany.
374
It seemed to kind of go down the middle.
375
What goes of Europe?
376
What's happening in Europe?
377
The investability of Europe, the ability to do business in Europe.
378
What do European industrial businesses do?
379
There's a ton of skill.
380
There's a ton of cash.
381
When you talk to those folks, what do you tell them?
382
I know you're very, very bearish on Europe.
383
You wouldn't put a dollar there, but is that correct?
384
Well, no.
385
For sweaters and wine, he puts much more than a dollar.
386
That's true.
387
Pretty prolific.
388
It's a really good question.
389
I actually think industrial...
390
I would draw charters, right?
391
Yes.
392
Industrials, I would.
393
Industrials, I think there's tremendous skill.
394
Outside of industrials, I think it's hard.
395
Yeah, so we have the problems with regulatory frameworks being way too cumbersome.
396
We have the geographic fragmentation in Europe, which is very different to the US.
397
Politically, it's really, I mean, quite in a bad place at the moment.
398
And so, yeah, I understand.
399
But at the same time, as you said, talent density is insane.
400
The universities are some of the best in the world.
401
So that's where our hope is in the next generation that's coming now.
402
Stick to the Nordics.
403
And the Nordics are very powerful, yes.
404
But I'm not 10 out of 5.
405
I'm German.
406
Yeah.
407
A little bit more.
408
So there's a lot of hope still.
409
Yeah, yeah.
410
Hey, what's your daily driver?
411
Daily driver is.
412
And then when you're with your daughter, I don't know how old she is, but you ever pull some tricks?
413
And is she like, hey, dad?
414
No, she shouts, drive slowly, daddy.
415
Really?
416
I'm not allowed to drive fast with her, no.
417
Terrified.
418
Which is fine.
419
Which is fine.
420
You don't want her to get into the family business.
421
No, no, no.
422
What are some investments that you're really excited by?
423
Beyond 11 Labs, there would be Applied Intuition, another one.
424
Oh, great.
425
Where I'm in.
426
That's a really, really interesting company.
427
It's a company that supplies software primarily to all the legacy car manufacturers that have not managed this transition to being software first.
428
Like Tesla has shown the way.
429
And this is a scale AI for automotive in some ways, right?
430
For part of the business.
431
Nico, you're going to fit right in.
432
Have you learned to play poker yet?
433
I'm a good poker player.
434
You're a good poker player?
435
We'll see you on Thursday.
436
Excuse me, hold on, Nico.
437
Now you're peaked at interest.
438
Give it up for Nico.
439
Great team.

And it said, We open source it to the fans and they've just gone crazy with it.
464
Love you, Sweeney.
465
Oh, man.
466
My apologies.
467
We should all just get a room and just have one big huge ordinance because there are all these under sound signs.
468
It's like this sexual tension that we just need to release somehow.
469
What your beat be.
470
Let your beat be your beat.
471
Waiting to get Mercy's Army.
472
I'm going all England.
473
I'm going all Elena.
