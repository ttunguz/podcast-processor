1
This is actually the time, in my opinion, not that I'm doing this because I have plenty of other things to do, but I would love to do this.
2
This is the time to start, you know, building, raising capital for a distressed, distressed fund vehicle.
3
So, when some of these companies end up having to sell their crypto at a meaningful loss, there's somebody with arms wide open willing to pay 10 cents on the dollar.

29
I'll just say real quick, I was at the Bitcoin conference.
30
None of you were there, right?
31
None of the three of you were at Bitcoin.
32
Stop.
33
I really do not like Vegas.
34
Maybe one day.
35
Why not, Jameson?
36
Why not?
37
Tell us why.
38
I mean, I don't want to get too off topic, but like, if you've been to a casino, you know what it's like.
39
It's that it's like that times a million.
40
And like, it's really kind of confusing when you're in there.
41
Like, they deliberately make it like a maze.
42
So like I had side events I was supposed to meet people at that I was like super late to despite leaving early.
43
It was so hot.
44
Anytime you had to walk outside, it was like 100 degrees.
45
I don't know.
46
And I'm just, I don't, I don't, I'm not a gambler as much.
47
I don't know.
48
I much prefer like nicer scenes like, you know, conferences when they're in Austin and Miami and stuff like that and Southern California.
49
Just better views.
50
I mean, Joe lives in Miami, so I guess he doesn't really care as much.
51
But like, yeah, that's my reason.
52
Vegas isn't my scene, but they'll be back there next year, so it is what it is.
53
Your eyes cry out too, right?
54
Go ahead, Joe.
55
Yeah, I was going to say, you got to do Vegas differently, man.
56
Avoid the casinos.
57
Book the best.
58
Some of the best restaurants in the world are there.
59
They have amazing shows.
60
You just avoid the casinos.
61
To that point, the Vegas hack is this.
62
You get bottomless Alaskan crab legs either at the Bellagia or the Cosmo Brunch.
63
When I land, I take my luggage, though.
64
I pull up.
65
They look at me like, all right, what's this guy again?
66
We know this guy.
67
He's going to just, he had a famine for the last 48 hours.
68
He's going to destroy protein.
69
They hide it in the back corner.
70
They know how to optimize.
71
But a good investor knows where to find the value.
72
So we just go through it.
73
Avoid all the insume distractions and the salad.
74
Straight to it.
75
I will say.
76
I actually went to a dinner with Iron, one of the Bitcoin mining companies, and the food was unreal.
77
So, yeah, everything, shout out to them for that.
78
But I went to a whole bunch of different restaurants and they were all absolutely top-notch.
79
It's just, I don't know.
80
It's a scene.
81
It's a vibe.
82
And ironically, I go to a TradFi ETF conference every year, and that's also in Vegas for the next couple of years.
83
So I'll be in Vegas probably at least twice a year for the next few years.
84
So let's get into the conference.
85
One, they had over 35,000 people there, I think, and I believe it based on the amount of, it was huge, bigger than anything I've ever seen from the Bitcoin.
86
It reminded me a little bit of Bitcoin 2022, which was in Miami at the convention center at Miami Beach.
87
That was also a scene, but they did like a festival on the weekend that year.
88
So there was a lot of people who were just like tertiarily interested in Bitcoin.
89
They were going for like a party.
90
This was, they had that many people and then some, and it wasn't really as much of that scene.
91
So, one, that was impressive.
92
The other thing I thought is very politically leaning right for the most part.
93
J.D.
94
Vance was there that spoke.
95
Don Jr., Eric Trump, Lomas obviously spoke about her Bitcoin bill that she's going to bring back to the floor.
96
One thing I did notice from J.D.
97
Vance that I liked is like he referred to, he likes Bitcoin, obviously, we know he holds it, and he referred to it as a hedge against bad policymaking, which I thought personally was like a really good quote.
98
But yeah, overall, it very feels, some people saw the guest list and they were like, is this like a Republican convention?
99
Somebody that I know was like, you're going to a Republican conference.
100
And I don't know.
101
I kind of wish it was a little more bipartisan, but I guess under that Biden admin, and that's not going to be the case.
102
So Pakistan made an announcement that they were basically going to do a Bitcoin.
103
It's still illegal here.
104
And the IMF is upset, so they're asking Pakistan to confirm what exactly is going on there.
105
So Pakistan seems to be leaning towards doing something on that front, but that was also very interesting.
106
Nigel Farage of the UK talked about a bill that he wants to do to lower cap gains on crypto and Bitcoin.
107
Eric Adams actually spoke about doing municipal Bit Bonds for New York.
108
PSG, one of the biggest football clubs in the world, is adopting Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset.
109
Saylor gave one of his textbook presentations calling for Bitcoin market cap to be 60 to 100 trillion 15 to 20 years from now.
110
I think that was the year's item, I'm not exactly sure.
111
And then, I mean, overall, I could keep going on.
112
There's like 15 other things.
113
Those are the key things that I thought were the main takeaway.
114
It was, it felt very like it was growing up compared to what I had seen in the like earlier years of the Bitcoin conference when I was going in 2021 and 2022.
115
But it still had the same sort of vibe, excitement, young crowd, and but it felt a little more grown up, I guess is the way to say it.
116
But the one thing that really stood out throughout everything, talking to everyone, everyone's talking about Bitcoin treasury companies, which is perfect for us to get into our next topic.
117
But before I do that, anything that I said that you guys want to dive into aside from the Bitcoin Treasury stuff, which we'll do first?
118
Yeah, I'll just mention something quickly.
119
So I wasn't personally there, but members of my team, including Dan Held, who's a general partner on our Bitcoin DeFi venture fund, we did an event with UTXO Management and Franklin Templeton.
120
UTXO Management is the company that produces the event.
121
And I was chatting with Dan today about this, and he had mentioned that there were so many side events that to have a packed event is challenging at this conference of this size.
122
So we were really pleased with that.
123
But the composition of the attendees at our event that Soma can really speak to was everything from OG Bitcoiners to institutional allocators to existing LPs of ours to builders in the Bitcoin DeFi space.
124
And something that really kind of resonated with me was the fact that the Bitcoin conference now, to your point, James, it's a bit grown up.
125
The fact that we were doing an event with someone like Franklin Templeton, coupled with the fact that pretty much every asset manager in the space was there, major political figures and politicians and policymakers globally were there.
126
It has grown up.
127
There's no doubt about it.
128
I saw a photo, I forget, I think one of the organizers tweeted it the other day where it shows like the first Bitcoin conference in like 2012 or 13 or something.
129
It's like three people in a room for years.
130
And then it shows this one.
131
There's just thousands of people.
132
It obviously has come a long way, but I do think that it is a mature, no surprise, it's maturing to the extent that it's at now.
133
And I don't think this is going to slow down anytime soon either, especially as this kind of global institutional wave kicks off, which is likely a good segue into these public company, corporate treasury, Bitcoin buying sprees.
134
Yeah, I would confirm that.
135
I mean, it was really high-quality attendees.
136
Like every, like even like my clients, like I had a lot of my clients that were there, people who are already involved in the Space.
137
So, yeah, it was a really high-quality conference.
138
Shout out to David Bailey.
139
He put on a hell of a show.
140
And I thought overall, side events, the events actually associated with all of it was really well done.
141
Yeah, no, briefly, the conference-made Wall Street Journal might have been the front page if you go to the online publication.
142
So, you know, Bitcoin has arrived here.
143
But they make the point that the conference, the title of this article is Bitcoin Goes All in on MAGA, shedding its anti-government stand.
144
So, you know, interestingly enough, last year at this time, Bitcoin was, the conference was very neutral.
145
Trump came and gave a speech there.
146
And then two months later, Bitcoin community got behind Trump and Fair Shake Pack and the rest of its history.
147
It's one of the three probably deft political moves that Trump made.
148
And now it's leaning further into that.
149
So I thought that was a good observation, and you're seeing the Wall Street Journal acknowledge that.
150
Yep.
151
All right.
152
Let's get into crypto treasury companies real quick.
153
It feels like they're all the rage.
154
I feel like we're hearing about, you know, everyone's copying Sailor's Playbook or some level of Sailor's Playbook.
155
I mean, we have it going on in the UK, we have it in countries all over the world.
156
I feel like there's a new announcement every other day, even if it's not somebody launching a Bitcoin treasury company, it's another company adding Bitcoin as part of their treasury, as part of their treasury reserve allocation.
157
I mean, it's honestly, it's kind of insane.
158
And with how much announcements I'm hearing and the dollar amounts, a lot of them are a lot of them in the billions, if not hundreds of millions.
159
And still the Bitcoin price isn't, I mean, obviously we hit an all-time high recently, but I feel like if I was hearing this.
160
So I'll let us dictate where these rabbit holes we go down.
161
But Joe, what are your thoughts overall on what's happening?
162
And it's not just Bitcoin, but let's start with Bitcoin for now because it's also happening in ANA and Ethereum.
163
Yeah, I mean, I have seen, I feel like I see a new deal like this every day for the past few weeks now.
164
I just want to rewind the clock a little bit here because I think a lot of the, you know, we had a discussion, I don't remember how many months ago this was, but we had a discussion of like there's so much token supply hitting the market and who's going to be the incremental buyer and it, you know, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
165
And at the time, what I had mentioned was that people have a mindset that the current state is like this fixed amount of money that's going to be allocated potentially to various cryptocurrencies.
166
And here we are with, I mean, how many, another one was announced today, Rytar Log Tech Holdings, buying a billion and a half of Bitcoin.
167
Now, those aren't altcoins or shit coins, but there are other entities doing this type of stuff.
168
So the irony here to me is that while so many in crypto Twitter were focused on the retail bid and when is it going to come back and are they going to buy altcoins and shit coins, you now have institutions just throwing around billions of dollars to buy crypto.
169
Now, obviously, the majority of that is Bitcoin and rightfully so, but there are other vehicles out there that are buying altcoins.
170
I think that there's, you know, it's a double-edged sword.
171
Okay.
172
So Michael Saylor has pulled off like the, you know, one of the most incredible trades, I guess you could say, in history.
173
And there's a very, I don't want to say an easy case, but it's an easier sell if you're going to be doing a clone or a copycat with some minor tweak to it and be able to pitch that to investors to say, hey, if you get into this, you know, pipe deal, you're locked up for six months, but look at what happened with MicroStrategy and MetaPlanet, and it's going to be a good deal.
174
Like, I'm not surprised that these folks are raising a significant amount of money.
175
We have, myself personally, or ASMS, we have no investments in any of these.
176
Not that we wouldn't, but we haven't seen anything that has made sense for our fund.
177
But the thing, the other kind of double-edged to the sword is this has, and Rom, I'm sure you can probably agree with me to some extent.
178
This has a bit of flavor or a reminder of the SPAC craziness in 2021.
179
I was thinking the exact same thing.
180
And because, like, you know, one of the things I try to do as a trader is just pattern match.
181
And I'm seeing a deal almost every day.
182
So, just like SPACs right now, and you know, we've got like Bitcointreasuries.net.
183
So there's all these sites that are tracking all these things.
184
I have a watch list and trading view to track all these companies, and it just keeps getting larger every single day.
185
So, on the one hand, the SPAC boom was certainly during a zero-interest rate environment and helicopter money being dumped to people during post-COVID times or during COVID.
186
It was a very, very different, I would say, global macro environment than today.
187
And SPACs were specific to the United States.
188
This is fundamentally different because.
189
We've been in a, I don't want to say, we're not in a tightening cycle anymore because we peaked on that, but like we've held rates pretty restricted for a pretty long time now.
190
We're not like at zero, right?
191
But the concern that I have is this is going to be a global phenomenon, right?
192
So these are companies in Canada, in Hong Kong, and of course the United States, Brazil.
193
There's nothing wrong with it.
194
I'm just saying that SPACs were centralized to the United States.
195
This is a global phenomenon.
196
So although the SPAC boom lasted, I don't know, depending on how you look at it, 18 to 24 months, and most of them imploded, this type of a bubble, if that's what you want to call it, could last for a long time.
197
It's a bubble, for sure.
198
Yeah, yeah.
199
But it's only a bubble if you're not invested in it, right?
200
So we're pointing it.
201
A lot of people could be investing in this thing for a really long time before you see this thing have for a catastrophic ending.
202
The first money in the bubble, make the money.
203
So if you're the first out of the gate with your SPACs and your offerings, you're good.
204
If you're putting a business plan together now or you're seeing the deal that you're the 38th person to see the deal, you're going to lose money.
205
What's the investment thesis, Joe?
206
Like if you're pitching an investor, they're pitching you.
207
Is it that you get warrants in the pipe?
208
And is it a SPAC-like structure?
209
Or what's the opportunity?
210
With MicroStrategy, it's very different.
211
It's a balance sheet play.
212
Then they wrapped debt and capital markets all around it.
213
Yeah, I mean, it's super deal-specific, and I won't mention any names.
214
I'll just speak at a high level.
215
The majority of it is you're getting basically a price per share at a discount to whatever the market rate is, right?
216
That's generally.
217
Now, some of them are, some of these are, I'm trying to make sure I don't disclose anything too sensitive, but some of these are basically like we're going to go buy $100 million worth of Bitcoin or Solana or whatever it is, right?
218
And then it's just going to be on the balance sheet.
219
Like, that's it.
220
I'm just like, you know, economic value creation there.
221
Well, and so that's what I'm, that's the part that I'm like, I don't, that's the bubble part that, you know, stands out to me.
222
We got six months to go, guys.
223
That's the clock starting.
224
Now, here's the thing, right?
225
Depending on, I don't remember if James or someone else mentioned this a while ago, but one of the fascinating things that Saylor did is that he started issuing debt, right?
226
He started targeting a buyer, the bond market, that couldn't buy Bitcoin, right?
227
So like really fucking smart move by him, you know, really, really smart.
228
Now, if you kind of extrapolate a little bit here and go to, say, other markets where people can't buy Ethereum or can't buy Solana, or it's not as easier for them to do that, or there's not ETFs available, and they want some level of levered exposure, I can see people then using this as a vehicle to go and do that.
229
But the 50th NASDAQ listed company that's buying a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin on their balance sheet, I don't, maybe I'm just not smart enough to figure it out, but to me, it just feels like that trade is over and that was micro strategy.
230
And in Japan, it was Meta Planet.
231
And I don't know who the additional one in the United States actually is.
232
There's a gap for Ethereum, I would say.
233
Ethereum needs a micro strategy and that will happen.
234
The rest, I don't quite really get it.
235
There's no incremental access, to your point.
236
That's what is doing, right?
237
They're doing each one of these.
238
Sorry.
239
There you go.
240
Yeah, STRK and STRF.
241
They're having STRD that's IPOing soon.
242
The gift that keeps on giving, right?
243
There's two concerns there.
244
And I guess it would be just leaving micro-strategies or sorry, strategy aside because that is the OG and it does have an interesting flywheel effect, which I won't even pretend to fully understand.
245
But leaving that aside, there's the concern, two concerns, two concerns, both of which we've seen before.
246
One, companies that are struggling using the announcement to get some PR and also perhaps a bump to their share price.
247
I mean, this is reminiscent of the early days when you would put blockchain in your name and suddenly your share price would go through the roof.
248
So we're seeing a lot of shaky companies adding to their balance sheet.
249
And we do have to ask ourselves what happens if that doesn't work out and they have to offload in a hurry.
250
Two, this is coinciding with a surge in crypto lending.
251
We saw the Cantor Fitzgerald announcement last week that they're now finally live on their institutional crypto lending.
252
That's institutional.
253
That's like as mainstream as you get, and there's a whole lot that are crypto-native lenders.
254
And so it's not a stretch to imagine many of these Bitcoin treasury companies using their Bitcoin as collateral for a loan to buy more Bitcoin and laying on the sea.
255
Again, this is very reminiscent of what we saw in 21-22, and it unwound pretty fast.
256
So there's also that risk.
257
Meanwhile, yes, buying demand, but also adding potential leverage that we won't necessarily get transparency on into a market that is feeling kind of fragile anyway.
258
Yeah, those are great points.
259
I mean, I actually thought at the beginning of the year when the banks were going to start doing crypto-related services, particularly on the prime brokerage side, and that's where we would see.
260
And ironically, it's these public companies that are shoving a ton of crypto on their balance sheet and then potentially lending against it.
261
I met with a company last week that's looking to do something fairly large in the crypto space, very similar concept.
262
And the number one question they asked was: where can we get yield?
263
And I was like, well, for that size, I'm not really sure.
264
You're going to have to kind of like either wait for the banks to open up and/or a lot of the kind of broker dealers that we trade with at Asymmetric can handle pretty decent size, but it's a supply-demand issue.
265
If all of a sudden you're chucking half a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin into a lending market, what does that do to the yield?
266
It is actually worth the counterparty risk, et cetera, et cetera.
267
Especially if many of these are in less regulated markets, as you said earlier, Joe.
268
They're looking for yield on Bitcoin by pledging that as collateral.
269
They're looking for yield more generally.
270
Proof of stake networks.
271
I mean, this particular company, again, we'll go in name, but they were just asking my opinion on some things.
272
I was like, yeah, like, you know, you're going to earn yield from proof of stake networks.
273
Like, you're not going to earn yield from Dogecoin unless you're lending it, right?
274
So, and this is more or less the same thing for Bitcoin, right?
275
The way to earn, I mean, typically the way to earn yield on Bitcoin is to lend your Bitcoin.
276
You could, of course, run some cover call strategy or something like to that effect, but you could end up getting called away, which has tax implications and all that.
277
So true yield, right, borrow lend is basically it, or you're, you know, you're utilizing the proof of stake network tokens like Ethereum, Solana, et cetera.
278
For me, this just feels like I'm not quite at the point where I think this is going to cause an implosion in markets at some point down the line, but I do think there's going to be a lot of these companies that end up coughing this stuff back up at some point.
279
Like, in the next bear market, if people didn't structure their debt properly or turn it out well enough, like, it's only a matter of time before people are coughing this time.
280
And I say that, and people are like, Sales are very smart.
281
I'm like, I'm not even necessarily, strategy could be completely fine.
282
There's so many of these things out there now that are doing this with like billions and billions of dollars, and you're injecting leverage into the system.
283
So, I don't think we know like exactly how this is going to play out.
284
And the other thing I would say is, like, I know Strike, Jack Moller's Strike, they just launched new lending for Bitcoin now, so you can borrow against your Bitcoin.
285
So, there's this is all this stuff is coming online more and more and more.
286
And it's kind of exciting to watch, I guess, is what I would say.
287
I'm getting kind of crazy as well.
288
Last week, I saw two announcements from companies that are looking to put the Trump token on their balance sheet.
289
Imagine why.
290
Jim Chano should short all these other companies.
291
Why he keeps shorting MicroStrategy doesn't make any sense to me.
292
But shorting all this other noise around the perimeter, that's where you should focus, Jim.
293
Well, so there's a couple things here.
294
One is the, what is it?
295
S-Bet is the ticker, S-B-E-T.
296
They announced last week that they're raising, I don't know, $450, $500 million to buy Ethereum, and ConsenSys is going to be helping them source that, et cetera.
297
So the price of the stock went from like $3 to $130 in like three sessions and then collapsed.
298
It's trading like in the 50s now.
299
Part of this is the fact that these stocks are so illiquid to trade that, you know, you can't really short them with size, right?
300
Now, the second thing that I'll point out is this is actually.
301
This is the time to start building and raising capital for a distressed fund vehicle.
302
So, when some of these companies end up having to sell their crypto at a meaningful loss, there's somebody with arms wide open willing to pay 10 cents on the dollar.
303
That's actually a really good idea, especially since we've got the Mt.
304
Gox distributions coming up soon.
305
We all know what interest there is around those.
306
The funny thing about distress, by the way, is over the last 15 years since the 2008 crisis, there hasn't been a year where distress has done well.
307
And part of this is just so much money in the system.
308
So much liquidity in the system.
309
They have these distressed funds that raise and they never get a chance to call capital.
310
Someone shows up with a bag of money and buys the asset.
311
I like the thesis, Joe, just for a market.
312
And by the way, that excess liquidity is part of what's driving digital assets.
313
Yep.
314
Exactly.
315
Well, I will say back in 2022, there were a pretty good number of distressed minor deals, but that adds a fraction to the size of what you see in TradFund.
316
You're right, there was.
317
Like in 2023, public markets and private markets, you could have done extraordinarily well for the six-month window.
318
That's right.
319
Yeah, real quick, we didn't even mention it, but I think most people already know this.
320
But for anyone listening who doesn't know this, Trump media actually closed the deal to do $2.4 billion in a private offering.
321
And most of that is going to go to be buying Bitcoin and crypto treasury deals.
322
So that's another one that's just huge.
323
And like, I don't know.
324
I still like, it doesn't feel right to me that Trump's company is doing so much in this space with his name on it and he's president.
325
But I guess if you're in this space, you have the most powerful man in the world, I guess, behind you, at least theoretically.
326
So that's a big plus.
327
I guess I don't know if anyone's in the comments there, but I also want to ask Joe or again, other guys, anyone else's opinion, like the first announcement is the one that Joe just brought up with Ethereum.
328
Like no one was doing this with Ethereum yet.
329
There's only one that's coming down the pike.
330
We've had a few Solana ones.
331
Like why did Solana happen a bunch before Ethereum?
332
Is that just because everyone basically wrote Ethereum off a few months ago?
333
I'll go to you, Joe, for the sole maxi.
334
Progress, Maxie.
335
As long as you're making progress, baby.
336
So, look, I have no knowledge or anything.
337
This is pure speculation as to why I think the Solana one was first.
338
I think it was Sol Strategies.
339
They reached out to me many, many months ago.
340
And at the time, I kind of looked at it and was like, I'm pretty long Solana.
341
So I don't know if I need to lever it anymore.
342
And, you know, shame on me.
343
I probably should have done the deal.
344
But I think part of the reason was that at the time, at least when this was being formed, there wasn't a clear path for ETF.
345
There wasn't really, I would say, easier institutional adoption.
346
The CME futures had launched none of that kind of stuff.
347
And so I think the idea was we can package this thing up as the fast, you know, the fastest horse.
348
There is no other real way to get access to this token in a public markets perspective.
349
Therefore, this should be the vehicle to do it in.
350
And it's worked.
351
I don't know.
352
DFDV, I think, is another one that's done very well in a short amount of time.
353
And in fact, what's interesting about some of these Solana ones, you should probably expect to see this with Ethereum.
354
I don't think this is unique to Solana, but with, I think it's the DFDD, they announced even today that last week they announced that their Solana that they have is staked and they created their own liquid staking token, liquid staking token.
355
So they have an LST now, and then that LST is now available in Kamino Finance, Angel Investor, full disclosure, but Comino Finance is a kind of borrow-lend market with some other interesting DeFi primitives and kind of applications.
356
This is now kind of this interesting full-circle moment where you have a public company that has Solana on their balance sheet that then took it and staked it and created their own liquid staking token and then took that LST and now put it onto a DeFi borrow lend protocol.
357
I don't think that's been done before.
358
That's pretty novel and interesting.
359
Maybe that's the beginning of a pattern for more of these companies to say, hey, instead of just like parking it in a custody provider and sitting on it, why don't you do something with it?
360
Well, and with Bitcoin, most of them just want to hold it.
361
Now, there are plenty of Bitcoin DeFi or BitFi protocols.
362
We've invested in a bunch of these.
363
We look at these deals at Asymmetric that you could do stuff with.
364
But with Solana, for whatever it's worth, it is very easy to do these things.
365
It's very easy to create an LST.
366
It's very easy to then team up with someone like Camino and have that be posted as collateral on their platform.
367
And it all happens really, really quickly because DFDD.
368
And they're already doing a lot of this more advanced DeFi-related stuff on Solana with the tokens that they have on their balance sheet.
369
Well, I'm excited about the Ethereum one.
370
I think that could catalyze that, Katara.
371
I think the reason why there's not been an Ethereum equivalent to micro strategy is because you need a personality.
372
I'll use Mimetic in digital assets.
373
There's a tribe.
374
You need a leader with personality.
375
Vitalex not going to do it.
376
Joe Lubin could do it.
377
It's a candidate.
378
They're obviously consensus to advance the ball around this.
379
But there's just a handful of people that have a voice like a Michael Saylor or Jack Mahler.
380
That's what you need to make it come together.
381
I was just going to say, quickly, for all those people that think I hate Ethereum, I actually flipped long in Ethereum last month.
382
I think it's a good idea, actually.
383
I have a question actually that's relevant to that.
384
Do you think the supply schedule has anything to do with it?
385
And Ethereum, with more activity, does have negative net news supply.
386
Solana doesn't.
387
Is that relevant?
388
I'm not asking about the overall thesis.
389
I'm asking about its case as a treasury asset.
390
And one of the cases we made for Bitcoin is that we know that however much the demand, the supply isn't going to change.
391
We also know that with Ethereum, the greater the demand, the lower the news supply.
392
But with Solana, is that the same situation?
393
That's actually a really great question in 0.00.
394
When I was speaking with this company last week that was looking to, they were asking me about staking and yield and these types of things, that was one of their questions.
395
And I had mentioned to them that a few weeks or maybe a month and a half or so ago, there was a proposal put forth to the Solana community of validators and developers and investors and stakeholders, if you will, to change the inflation schedule.
396
And one of the counter-arguments to doing it came from a good friend of mine, Lily Liu, who's the president of Solana Foundation.
397
She's absolutely brilliant.
398
And one of the things that she mentioned was that institutions don't want a variable rate as it relates to this inflation.
399
And we're getting Solana ETFs, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
400
Now, there was a counter-argument to it as well from Tushar at Multicoin, which was also very valid.
401
The point is, that was the first question that was asked on this call.
402
I don't know if that is why they're choosing to do it, how it relates to Ethereum, but currently Solana does have the fixed inflation schedule, and that could change.
403
But I'm pretty sure that's not the reason people are putting it on the balance sheet.
404
I'm pretty sure it's because it's likely what I was mentioning prior: there's a lack of access for people that just want to open up Robinhood or Schwab or get on the phone and call their broker and buy something.
405
That's likely the case.
406
But DFTV is actually proving to be a little bit different here because they're actually doing stuff with the token itself.
407
And I think, to Ron's point, that should be the case with Ethereum as well.
408
And maybe that is what helps kind of open the eyes to the broader investment community to say, hey, there's more that you can do than just speculate and hold these assets.
409
Look at these companies that are actually doing it with putting to work the cryptocurrency that's on their balance sheet.
410
Yeah, so this is a really good transition point.
411
So the last thing I would say to wrap a bow on this, Joe has kind of hinted at it.
412
He's heard a lot of these deals are coming that are not public yet.
413
I've heard of a few deals that are not public yet.
414
I know of other people who said they've seen decks on this stuff.
415
Like the stuff that's being announced now wasn't started like two weeks ago.
416
Like this stuff was started months ago.
417
Like there's a lot of lawyers involved, there's a lot of capital.
418
It could keep, it's going to keep going for some time.
419
So who knows when we'll get out of this SPAC-like bubble in these things.
420
I don't think long-term it makes sense to be adding some of these assets as a treasury reserve asset personally.
421
But yeah, I would just say like anyone listening to this, like these things that are happening now started months ago.
422
Like this is not something that people can just spin up in a couple weeks, particularly if you're starting a completely new entity.
423
If you're just like another company that's adding it, okay, maybe it could have happened somewhat quickly.
424
But all these new IPOs, these new companies, these things have been long in the planning stage.
425
Two brief points.
426
One is no idea is original.
427
They get inspired in people around the same time.
428
Execution matters.
429
Two is this is the late part of it, but differentiation does matter.
430
Last one on this, I saw a deal.
431
I can't show much about it now, but it's a clever way to transform dividend and staking income into principal appreciation through structuring.
432
So it's like a Berkshire Hathaway version of one of these things.
433
I think that's clever.
434
It's a differentiated version of approaching this.
435
That is unique.
436
Yeah.
437
Yeah.
438
All right.
439
I'm going to talk about something going on with the ETTS, which is absolutely fascinating, but I'm a nerd.
440
So maybe it's not as fascinating you guys can tell me after I give a rundown.
441
But here, let's hear from our sponsors real quick.
442
Hey, everyone, Matt Hogan, Chief Investment Officer for Bitwise Asset Management.
443
Every week, I write a short five-minute memo on the biggest topic facing crypto investors.
444
This week, I tackle Bitcoin's role in a traditional portfolio and how I think most people approach the topic wrong.
445
Specifically, I explain how you can mix Bitcoin into a portfolio of stocks and bonds to create a new portfolio that at least on a fact-tested basis, has both higher returns and lower risk.
446
Intrigued?
447
Check out my memo at bitwiseinvestments.com/slash CIO memo.

456
Yeah, let's talk about what happened with ETFs over the last few days, which kind of started happening while I was at the Bitcoin conference.
457
Real quick, Rex shares and Osprey are kind of like this, they're interrelated companies, sisters, if you will.
458
And they had a bunch of filings, including one for Bonk, I believe, but they had a whole bunch of these filings that were structured as 40 AC products.
459
I don't want to go like too in the weeds here, but I do need to start at a level, like so you can, there's some little bit of understanding.
460
Most ETFs back in the day had to go through that process that we go through for these Spock crypto assets, where they go through the 19b4 process.
461
That's when you hear about all these delays for, you know, people trying to do in-kind or staking and all these different things.
462
Any ETF that launched, it kind of had to go through that same process.
463
They created this new rule called Rule 6011, commonly referred to as the ETF rule.
464
It does a whole bunch of stuff for ETFs, makes filing and launching them a lot easier, a lot cheaper, all these different things.
465
But the main thing it does is you don't have to go through that long, drawn-out 19b4 process to get a mutual fund, yada, yada, yada.
466
If we have questions, you guys can ask.
467
But really, what's happened is what Rex and Osprey did is they tried to go a unique way to get staking products to market.
468
And there's two unique things here.
469
One, so they filed for two ETFs a while ago.
470
They changed those filings and they filed for a Solana staking ETF and an Ethereum staking ETF.
471
And the way things work under that rule 6C11 or the ETF rule is once you launch, theoretically after 75 days, you can go effective, which means you file as an effective prospectus and then you can list the product within a couple days.
472
What they did, they filed for that on Friday for a Solana staking ETF and an Ethereum staking ETF.
473
And the way they say they qualify for Rule 6C11 under that 40 Act is basically saying we have a Cayman subsidiary in here that's holding the underlying assets that will be doing the staking, the whole staking tokens, as we were just talking about before with Joe.
474
And the other unique thing is they're going to be structured as a C Corp.
475
So like a traditional corporation.
476
There are a couple ETFs out there that do that to get over some of the issues with like pass-through entities.
477
So like ETFs are pass-through entities, so essentially you're not paying taxes when they go through.
478
But the C Corp, they thought they had a way that was like a silver bullet.
479
So using this Cayman subsidiary, using this unique, obscure regulatory structure that's not typically used for an ETF, that they found the silver bullet to get to first and get out first.
480
And so they filed for an effective prospectus on Friday.
481
But shortly thereafter, the SEC was basically like, yo, not so fast.
482
We don't think you qualify for these rules.
483
And they're going back and forth at them.
484
So they're basically saying you can't launch.
485
We're going to fight this.
486
So I don't know.
487
It makes sense that they would try something like this because if they have to wait when everyone else has to wait when staking is allowed in a grant or trust, which I do think is ultimately going to happen, they're competing against BlackRock and everyone else right off the bat.
488
So they figured, let's jump this shark here and try to get this out.
489
And it will be interesting to see if it actually gets through.
490
But the SEC seemed keen on not letting this happen.
491
Anything I said that didn't make sense or anything that you think is particularly interesting to hone in on?
492
I'll go to you, Noel, first or Joe.
493
I do have a question.
494
Did you see this coming?
495
Is this anything like what you've seen before?
496
Did you expect this?
497
Yeah, so we knew about the Cayman sub filings.
498
So basically, what they did is they filed this a long time ago, back when all these other, the first Solana spot ETS were filed earlier this year.
499
And basically right after Trump's, right around Trump's inauguration, all this filed in January.
500
And like I said, it's 75 days.
501
So I was looking at these and I was curious what the SEC was going to do because of the Cayman sub thing, which usually people use for tax purposes and for complex strategies and partnerships.
502
It kind of makes things smoother for end investors theoretically, but usually they're for securities.
503
So like you kind of need them to be securities to kind of do this.
504
There's all these complexities in there.
505
What they did was they had this filing and they just changed it to be soul staking and Ethereum staking rather than just Solana and Ethereum.
506
So they kind of changed these things at the last minute.
507
So did I see this coming?
508
I kind of heard rumblings that something was going on.
509
But no, I didn't really see this happening.
510
But I thought it was a good play because I'm mainly watching those 19 before processes for these types of products.
511
Like the products you want are the spot products, right?
512
Those are the ones like, it's like the Bitcoin Futures ECF, the ETH.
513
But if you're an end investor, you want the true, tried and tested, simple spot products.
514
So I do this kind of similar to that.
515
But if you're a small issuer, if you can get a couple hundred million by offering exposure to each staking or Solana staking, even if it's an obscure wrapper, even the best way to get exposure, it might be valuable to get it out there.
516
And I think that's what they were trying here.
517
Not done yet.
518
They seem to think they're going to be able to satisfy the SEC's concerns, but the SEC is kind of saying, I don't think so.
519
So I don't know.
520
We'll see.
521
And so it sounds like it was a play just to get out fast rather than wait for a decision on the staking distribution of the spot ETFs as they come through it, Mike.
522
Exactly.
523
100%.
524
Well, so this actually raises an interesting question from my perspective, given that we were just talking about DFDV, the Solana corporate treasury folks that stake their tokens and now they have an LST, et cetera.
525
Like the interesting thing here is: here's a public company that's doing staking, right?
526
Like, sure, they're not an ETF issuer, and I know there's a whole host of other rules and regulations associated with issuing an ETF, et cetera.
527
But it's like this company was able to do this with no issue, and the value of their shares now can be justified to some extent by having a revenue source from staking, right?
528
Yet it's not okay from the SEC.
529
And so, for ETFs, from what it sounds like, hey, like, do you think that these companies assume, worst case, I know I'm in the same camp as you, that the staking probably gets approved, but assume it doesn't.
530
Does this, do you think, in your mind, accelerate some of these other companies to just?
531
And instead of issuing ETF, they go buy some $3 million market cap company and say, hey, we're going to shove $200 million worth of Solana or Ethereum onto your balance sheet and start staking it and generating yield from that strategy?
532
I mean, it's possible.
533
I think people are pretty optimistic.
534
I mean, the SEC, I know for a fact, is having meetings.
535
They're working towards doing this.
536
I mean, part of the main concern is like these things are granter trusts.
537
So I talked about C-Corp, like some are set up as partnerships.
538
Most are set up as like 40 Act mutual funds, open-end funds.
539
The spot products are set up as granter trusts, and there's issues, there's potential issues with the IRS around getting in-kind distributions essentially from that staking.
540
So the concerns are more around that side of things and just logistics and getting like the legal and regulatory framework set up to allow these things to actually do staking.
541
More so than like the SEC doesn't want ETFs to do staking.
542
It's more like dotting I's and crossing T's and allowing this to like fit in the overall regulatory framework than we don't think these things should be allowed.
543
So I'm confident that the SEC and these issuers will be able to get to the bottom to figure out a way to fit this in current rules, but there's no guarantees here.
544
I mean the final deadline for their first application for staking is October 23rd.
545
So they still have many months before they have to make a decision where it's going to be yes or no.
546
And I think they'll be able to figure it out.
547
And I think that's part of the other reason why the SEC is like, we're trying to figure out how to do this.
548
And you guys are like this, other companies coming in trying to do this.
549
And I know the guys at Rex and Osprey, they're awesome.
550
And I'm always rooting for them because I don't know.
551
I like this obscure stuff.
552
But the SEC is kind of annoying.
553
I'm going to read a quote.
554
So Caroline Crenshaw, who is like the most anti-crypto person left.
555
But when she issued a comment to my colleagues in Bloomberg News, she basically said, How is it these crypto assets are supposedly not securities when it comes to registration requirements, but conveniently they're securities when a registrant sees an opportunity to sell a new product?
556
And then she said, If you're confused, join the club, which is pretty spicy, which I got to respect it because I kind of get what, again, both sides, but yeah, pretty funny.
557
Michael, I do have to say, and again, I don't want to praise you too much in public, James, obviously, but you made a really confusing situation sound understandable.
558
So, hats off to you for that.
559
Thank you.
560
Yeah, I've been a little bit too far in the weeds on this, but I guess it's my job.
561
It's a job, dude.
562
Yeah.
563
Like, sometimes, you know, you're doing stuff and you're like, yeah, you have imposter syndrome, you know?
564
And then sometimes you're like, I actually, you know, some of this stuff I'm not confused.
565
I actually noticed.
566
Well, you know what?
567
So speaking of your job, and you're an expert in it, can you talk briefly about ETF flows?
568
Yeah.
569
I mean, so every, basically, one of the last times I was on here, I saw how money was pouring out of the Bitcoin ETFs, money was pouring out of the Ethereum ETFs.
570
I was saying a lot of that seemed like it was the basis trades.
571
Basis trades now, still single-digits across Bitcoin, ETH, and Solana when you're looking at the ETS versus like the CME futures.
572
So, but despite that, we're seeing tons of buying.
573
I mean, from the bottom, at the end of April, the Bitcoin ETFs have taken in like $9 billion so far on a net basis.
574
Actually, one thing that's interesting is this year, I-Bit is actually more than 100% of the flows because technically there's been more money that's come out of the funds, and IBIT's been the one that's taken.
575
So, Eric, my boss, actually thinks that might be a signal that it's institutions coming in.
576
So, I think, you know, everyone was talking about the decoupling.
577
I actually think it did garner institutional interest because the money that's pouring in into the Bitcoin ETS, also Ethereum.
578
Ethereum's almost, they saw $800 billion of outflows, which was like a third of the assets that had come in.
579
They're at over $800 million that has come back in since the bottom.
580
So, like, money's pouring in, and it's not for the basis trade.
581
So, this money is coming in likely more from the institutional side.
582
Because if you're a retail investor, I don't know, you probably look for the cheaper thing.
583
Like, VanEx Holdle is still a 0% fee right now.
584
If you're doing your due diligence, you might be buying some of these other products.
585
But for the most part, all the buying is IBIT.
586
And the people who really care about ultra-liquidity that IBIT and GBDC actually has as well for the most part, but IBIT's the leader.
587
Options liquidity, which is all on IBIT, it's the institutions that are going to care about it.
588
If you're a retail investor looking to buy, you're probably going to go for the cheapest one, like Grayscale's BTC, which only has a 15 basis points, or VanEx Holdle, or somebody at Bitwise's product is actually cheaper, sponsor of the show, than IBIT.
589
But still, IBIT's the one getting all the money, which tells me it's likely institutions that are buying.
590
Now, are they short-term buy or are they long-term buy and hold?
591
We'll have to wait till we see the 13Fs from the end of the second quarter.
592
But I mean, these things are still raking in money, hand over the fist.
593
A lot of investors, even hedge funds, are coming into the space.
594
So I pointed out that I thought we have the end of 331, and I'm like, I bet we'll see outflows from hedge funds.
595
Now, a lot of money went into registered investment advisors, some other areas that were buying the Bitcoin ETFs.
596
Ironically, hedge funds actually did buy a little bit.
597
So, on a net basis, I'm sure a lot did sell, but hedge funds overall ball.
598
So, this is easier, less gap risk, too.
599
I think it's more than institutions.
600
Why do you think it's not the basis trade, Jeff?
601
Because the basis trade really picks up when you see like double-digit yields.
602
And we're just not there.
603
Like, the basis trade actually went negative, not fully negative, but it went real low rather recently.
604
So, you need double-digit yields essentially on like a net basis, probably, before people start pouring in, like what happened in the end of November and into December and even into early January.
605
And then that's when we saw a lot of these outflows happening because basis literally went negative.
606
So, money's pouring out, and we're just not seeing it.
607
And also, when you look at the CME futures, like the open interest, like if we saw a ton of flows and open interest was rocketing, I'd be like, okay, maybe this is the basis trade, and we just aren't seeing that.
608
So, like, when flows were coming out, I was able to see CME open interest dropping, and you're just not seeing it to that level.
609
Obviously, it is ticking up, but it's not.
610
It's not the same, like, one-to-one relationship I saw in December and January that was pointing to the basis trade.
611
That's true.
612
I was tracking the basis trade last week, and I noticed that a lot of inflows last week, but also the basis, the annualized return, really, it got up really close.
613
It went just over 10%, came way back down on Friday, and is heading lower still.
614
But it did head up for a bit.
615
And so, I thought, aha, basis trade inflows.
616
But yeah, you could be right.
617
Maybe just even 10% is not enough.
618
I mean, some of it, I'm sure some of the money, people are still willing to take like, you know, 10% returns on their basis trade.
619
It's almost risk-free, not quite.
620
But the real money that pours in, like, some of the flows might be that, but, like, it's not, it's not causing 9 billion of flows from the bottom into Bitcoin ETS.
621
There's just no way.
622
All right, let's go.
623
I guess there's a lot of things going on in the trade deals.
624
We can talk about geopolitical stuff.
625
I know Ron wants to talk about jobless claims and softening markets there on the job side.
626
But Noel, what are some things that you're specifically looking at on the macro side?
627
For me, it's a geopolitical story.
628
I mean, the macro data is interesting, and at this point, it's sending some very interesting signals about interest rate moves, but it's a geopolitical story right now.
629
There's so much uncertainty, the actual data points aren't that relevant.
630
And the geopolitical uncertainty arguably ratcheted up a hell of a lot over the past few days.
631
I mean, last week we saw the Court of International Trade unanimously rule that President Trump had overstepped his authority when he used the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to declare national emergency that warranted broad tariffs.
632
That was unanimous.
633
And of course, the White House appealed right away, and they got a stay.
634
They are allowed to continue to apply the tariffs while the appeal works its way through the system.
635
The White House has said they're going to send this all the way to the Supreme Court, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're going to win because this particular Supreme Court has not been hesitant in curbing what it sees as executive overreach.
636
So there's still going to be tariffs.
637
The White House, the administration, is looking at applying Section 122 of the Assembly Four Trade Act, which means they can apply 15% across the board for 150 days.
638
Now, that could hurt, but it's still not what President Trump has been talking about so far.
639
And 15%, most trade partners, can probably weather that and discuss them now for how long that would last, would Congress actually approve an extension.
640
So tariffs are still there, still going to cause some economic damage, but nothing like they could have had Trump thought he had the bargaining chips.
641
And then, on top of all that, you have the deepening rift between China and the U.S.
642
with the Geneva Agreement apparently torn up and both sides really mad at each other.
643
By now, we're used to extreme rhetoric from President Trump, but I have never seen such stern wording from the Chinese authorities before.
644
On Friday, Trump unleashed an angry post in lots of all caps accusing China of breaking the Geneva Agreement and regretting being Mr.
645
Nice Guy.
646
And then on Sunday, Treasury Secretary Scott DeSenter elaborated that China had been slow walking the export approvals for rare earths.
647
And this came just a couple of days after Reuters had reported that two auto-manufacturing associations had sent a letter to the White House warning of production stoppages because of the looming shortages of rare earths.
648
Now, China has responded with accusations that it is the U.S.
649
who is breaking the Geneva Agreement.
650
This really is starting to feel like playground stuff.
651
The U.S.
652
is not acting in good faith, etc., etc.
653
And Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's comments over the weekend in Singapore at the Asia Shang-Lila Security Summit certainly didn't help.
654
He pretty much accused China of preparing to invade Taiwan no later than 2027.
655
And he advised all there, all the military chiefs of Asia and many developed countries as well, to beware of China's ramp-up in defense spending.
656
Well, China did not like.
657
of being a hegemonic power stuck in a Cold War mentality and warned it to not play with fire, those were its words, on the Taiwan situation.
658
So things have really, the heat has been turned up several notches, and that's not going to necessarily be good for the gainstability and for investors to be able to figure out where market direction is going.
659
And that's not even taking into account what Ukraine did yesterday in launching the drone attack against Russian airfields.
660
I'm not even talking about the damage to the Russian Air Force, which was considerable.
661
What Ukraine did was weaponize trade containers.
662
And we have yet to get our heads around what this is going to do to supply chains around the world.
663
Trade changed yesterday.
664
So it's not a surprise that gold is shooting up.
665
It's up 4.5%, I think, since Thursday, because alarm bells are going off in boardrooms around the world.
666
Oil is heading up despite OPEC Plus increasing the production quota increases that they'd already planned.
667
So those are another, there are more alarm bells going off there.
668
And at the same time, you have VIX really low.
669
It's down by 18, which shows that the market is not really paying attention to all of this.
670
So the geopolitical environment right now is saying caution.
671
It's interesting that Bitcoin is not acting either like a safe haven or like a risk asset, despite, as we opened with, the flood of announcements coming in from big buyers.
672
So it's worth looking at what's going on there.
673
Yeah, I mean, that Ukraine, I mean, if you.
674
Probably it's kind of crazy what they were able to do against Russia.
675
But yeah, this isn't a war podcast, so we don't really need to go down that too much.
676
But Joe, what are your thoughts on what Noel just said?
677
I mean, what she made about trade is kind of fascinating.
678
That's what I was going to say.
679
I think Noel is spot on with saying, like, it's all geopolitical right now.
680
And if you kind of take it a few steps removed, you know, from the actual attack that Ukraine did on Russia's Air Force, I think it destroyed like 40 bombers or something.
681
And it was like 2,500 miles away.
682
The potential impact is how does this affect trade?
683
And I immediately saw, no surprise on Twitter, people saying that this has already infiltrated the United States.
684
And maybe that's true, but it's odd that no one mentioned that until this happened, right?
685
But there is real risk there, right?
686
Because if you can treat supply chain and the trading containers, the ships, whatever, as mobile military bases to launch things from, I mean, that's not great for supply chain, right?
687
That's certainly not good for trade.
688
And I don't think that maybe in the United States, I'm not sure about the rest of the world, maybe the IDF and Israel, but I'm just speculating, don't have the technical capacity to manage this type of stuff because the technology is moving way too fast and governments move.
689
So, for example, these swarms of drones that could affect that could be in containers and ultimately affect supply chain and it could launch attacks on various countries could just easily be trained by AI agents as well to run them, right?
690
You could have these things be entirely autonomous, and then who do you go after if someone's not claiming those types of attacks?
691
So, it's a real concern.
692
Um, I do think it will be written about this.
693
Is Mossad-style work?
694
Uh, it's it's I read it, was just like, this is unbelievable.
695
Um, but I look at the VIX and the point that Noel is making, like, it seems to be rather subdued.
696
Market is somewhat shaking this off.
697
I think part of it is the yes, this is a material attack on Russia, but I think the market's just kind of like, oh, yeah, there's a war going on between the Ukraine and Russia.
698
And I'm not meaning to downplay the impact and importance of that, but it's just not currently affecting things like equity markets.
699
Oil has been, oil is a barometer for war, so it definitely ticked up today.
700
But there was also a lot of heavy short positioning, near belows, so could have been just a technical bounce or something.
701
Gold, interesting move for sure.
702
And I do think that part of the move in risk assets today, and you know, Bitcoin aside, I wrote about this, I still think this is the case today.
703
There's just so many managers that are underweight equities still.
704
And, you know, like if you saw, you know, we're recording this on Monday, June 2nd, Meta was up like almost 4%, 3.5% today.
705
And it was.
706
A lot of these stocks have more than retraced the moves.
707
And, you know, it's almost mechanical.
708
Like, I talked about this a few months ago: saying like the selling was just this mechanistic, systematic selling that had to happen out of these multi-platform pod shops that were running all these factor strategies.
709
Well, now we have this CTA bid, Vol control fund bid, as well as the corporate buybacks into the second week of June.
710
This has been going on for weeks.
711
And so, you know, I've been seeing a lot of doomers on crypto Twitter or FinTwit basically saying like, stocks are topping.
712
It's going to crash.
713
It's going to go back to the lows.
714
And it's like, there's just billions and billions of dollars worth of passive bid into this market right now.
715
And that's not changing, even in the face of the rhetoric between the U.S.
716
and China, the Ukraine, you know, Russia conflict, rising price of gold, rising price of oil, because there's really only one direction that this stock market goes when you have that big of a passive bid.
717
Yeah, I think these geopolitical risks are nothing burgers.
718
I agree with Joe's perspective too.
719
Look, just zoom out.
720
What drives asset prices, especially stock prices, are earnings growth.
721
We just saw 12% year-over-year earnings growth.
722
Interest rates, I think, topped out.
723
There's a scare that's behind us now.
724
Third is inflation, where we got disinflation, core PCE came in just fine.
725
And then we've seen peak fear around tariffs.
726
That's receding.
727
You got the Voldecay, which creates a natural mechanical bid, to Joe's point.
728
China's not going to invade Taiwan in the next two years.
729
I'm glad Hexeth sounded the alarm to create more defense spending locally.
730
That can actually de-risk things.
731
I'm sure China's looking at the asymmetric benefits that Ukraine is achieving versus Russia right now, and Taiwan can benefit from that and their own drone development.
732
These geopolitical risks are just noise.
733
They're distractions.
734
It's a very bullish setup.
735
Actually, I agree, people are offsides and wrong way positioned.
736
I think what you're going to see is more rotation because the MAG7s rallied quite sharply and quickly.
737
Netto is actually one of my favorite names I sold recently if only because they were approaching their valuations levels.
738
We usually see them top out.
739
And now you're seeing rotation to other catch-up names and other areas will start to pick up.
740
So you should be bullish.
741
And you got rate cuts coming in Q4 as well.
742
The coincident indicators are fine.
743
Productivity growth is fine.
744
The flying of the ointment is that you will see an impact from tariffs in July, August, September.
745
It'll be like a whiff of bad air kind of thing.
746
That's what I expect.
747
And then we'll get beyond that.
748
Initial claims and continuing claims did go in the wrong direction last Thursday, by the way.
749
It seems to happen at this time of year almost every year.
750
It's really funny.
751
I don't know if it has to do with summer seasonality and all this stuff, but there's always these weird surprises.
752
And people, if you want to see bad Rorschach techs, you're going to get that probably the next three months.
753
But, you know, it was a good article from the Wall Street Journal that was also published today.
754
And they highlighted, I'll share my screen here, that the tariff rate is going from 2.2% to something like 18%.
755
And that'll impact lower-income individuals.
756
So I think it's a buy-in.
757
However, it's a bifurcated set of outcomes that will play out, right?
758
In terms of retail versus consumer discretionary, but hyperscale is going to be fine.
759
Data cell is going to be fine.
760
They're still going to keep spending.
761
Two things.
762
One, you said asymmetric, which aside from being Joe's firm's name, I wanted to point out some of the doors.
763
It's correct with the warfare because the drones, like a couple thousand dollars for those drones.
764
I mean, we'll aggressively say the cost of materials for the attack they did was a million, maybe a couple million.
765
And the estimates are like $7 billion in damage, which like, if that's not asymmetric warfare, I don't know what is.
766
So those numbers that are sort of throw out there are absolutely, completely insane.
767
The other thing I want to say is, talking about macro, like one of the things I've been thinking about, and I've heard on other podcasts and people I respect, how much of some of the numbers we're seeing now is partially due to people front-running the tariffs.
768
I mean, there was a huge front-running of tariffs, and then all of a sudden there was no buying.
769
So some of that stuff you were talking about, the Verse Arch test coming over the next couple months, part of it could be there's like a slowdown because there's a gap between people ordering and the tariffs being lessened and things like that.
770
There could be a gap there.
771
Things could actually be slowing down.
772
It kind of does matter what actually happens with these tariffs and what actually happens.
773
Check out GDP now.
774
It's clocking in hot, 4.6% hot.
775
And you're right, there is acceleration.
776
I talked to the sharpest retail consumer analyst I know.
777
She's my hairdresser three blocks down the street.
778
I don't see her often.
779
I don't have enough.
780
But I asked her, I said, like, what are you seeing on the ground?
781
And she's a shopper, like handbags and the whole thing, Ulta.
782
She knows the brand and the retail layout.
783
And she said, yeah, people are accelerating purchases.
784
I said, huh, that's pretty interesting.
785
I said, what about big ticket items like cars?
786
She said, well, she knows parents that are purchasing ahead of their kids turning 16 or 17.
787
They're getting ahead of the birthday to just pick up a bit more savings.
788
And autos are the number two expenditure for a consumer after a mortgage.
789
We're also seeing more activity on home listings.
790
So that's increasing.
791
But yeah, no, I do think there's a pickup.
792
You know, it's not usually the case that you get a strong GDP quarter and the next quarter is also strong.
793
You know, in Q421, you have 20% year-over-year earnings growth.
794
That was the last quarter of stimmy checks and stimulus and all the rest, and everyone's in a sugar high.
795
And then, of course, you have a bear market start.
796
So I think that's why I do think a step back in the next quarter, maybe around mid-July, where the negative seasonality kicks in.
797
That's kind of my base case right now.
798
I would expect something like that to play out.
799
You probably get some good bargains sometime in September.
800
Okay.
801
I'll wind this up by saying that precisely for the reasons you mentioned, the economic data is just confusing.
802
And so there's not really much to be gained by dwelling on it a lot.
803
Front running, we're seeing that in the data.
804
This is also going to come through in some of the employment data we're going to be getting this week as well.
805
The economic data, I'll go out and eliminate.
806
Right now, it's not that relevant.
807
I do think that the biggest story is the geopolitical because we're underestimating the impact of the turmoil.
808
It's not priced in.
809
The only thing I will add is.
810
I thought more CEOs for Q1 earnings that came out this quarter would be more cautious or negative on their guidance, and they weren't.
811
That was very surprising to me, and it actually made me more bullish risk assets, particularly equities.
812
Clearly, there were some companies where they guided lower or didn't guide at all, but there really wasn't a lot in guidance from these CEOs that was just pervasive across, say, the SP 500.
813
And I thought that that is worth mentioning because I would think coming out of Q1 into the April 2nd Liberation Day, like your CFO and your PR firm is coaching you on how to be very conservative on your earnings call.
814
And I just didn't see that be the case.
815
I mean, maybe it's anecdotal, but I think I saw a stat suggesting that the lion's share of companies that have reported, which is the majority of the SP 500 at this point, haven't really changed guidance and in some cases increased it.
816
That doesn't typically happen if tariffs are going to destroy the economy or that the economy is slowing down.
817
True.
818
And margins are still very healthy, if not even increasing.
819
So there's plenty of cushion.
820
Yeah, I'm not worried about waves of bankruptcies or anything like that.
821
And I certainly don't go into individual names or even sectors.
822
It's the dollar, basically, is what I keep an eye on.
823
And that is heading down because of the geopolitical uncertainty.
824
Okay.
825
Any other comments on macro before we get to Ram to talk a little bit about AI and so we can wrap up?
826
I'll mention one more quick thing.
827
Hopefully it'll be quick because it'll certainly be somewhat controversial, but I don't think the Fed or the trade.
828
There's a guy, I'm going to probably mispronounce his last name, but I highly recommend following him on Twitter.
829
His name is Warren Pais or P-I-E-S.
830
I don't know how to pronounce the last name.
831
I'm assuming it's Paize.
832
He's really, really good.
833
And he posted something, I think, either this morning or yesterday over the weekend, showing sort of a dot plot of the yield curve.
834
And we're kind of like we're finally getting to pre-global financial crisis yield curve, even though it bears steepened this year, which is typically in a healthy, growing economy.
835
So I see a lot of doomers go around.
836
Oh, my God, the 30-year is that 5% or whatever, and it's the end of the world.
837
And it just wasn't the end of the world before the global financial crisis.
838
So I did want to point that out that the yield curve steeping the way it is isn't necessarily a harbinger of bad things to come.
839
I agree.
840
Ray Galio's clip that went viral talking about how the U.S.
841
fiscal situation is going to end in a bad thing.
842
That was the top in rates.
843
That's it.
844
Yep.
845
I'm more pessimistic on rates, but I agree with you, Joe, in that this right now is not the crisis level.
846
I think that's much higher.
847
Yeah, I mean, we didn't really talk too much about Trump's big, beautiful bill.
848
But like, it's just, it was funny to me because I feel like you hear about all this stuff, and it's like the Republicans are going to come in and they're going to, you know, they're not going to spend, and cause some of the issues you're talking about potentially the long end of the curve.
849
But like, Republicans and Democrats like to spend, except the Republicans like to spend by cutting taxes and regulations, and the Democrats like to spend by increasing taxes and putting out like other, like, you know, everyone's spending.
850
It's insane.
851
Yeah, wartime deficit.
852
It's bullish.
853
It's all bullish.
854
Like, as an American citizen, I wish Congress had their act together and weren't spending like drunken sailors.
855
But it is bullish.
856
Like, don't lose sight of the main takeaway.
857
Dollar curve.
858
I thought the why rates are going up.
859
The other part, like, the baby boomers are running the economy.
860
$60 trillion in wealth.
861
They're spending.
862
They're going to shift from savings to consumption.
863
So the big trends are still bullish.
864
I think don't miss the squiggle for the bigger trend.
865
Let's wrap up and talk about some AI.
866
There's a whole bunch of other topics on here, but it's okay.
867
Ron, let's talk about AI disruption.
868
Quick highlights.
869
We get a Super Bowl every week in financial markets, which is great.
870
This past week, it was NVIDIA.
871
They reported it was a beat and a beat, which is kind of amazing because every time they report, it's always a beat and a beat.
872
I think the main takeaway, though, is that he said in 2030, you'll have a trillion in CapEx, which is 3x from where you are now.
873
And those numbers sound sensational, except what Jensen says, he over-delivers on.
874
It's a credible number.
875
How much?
876
Right, it's a credible, those are a credible number.
877
But you know, he doesn't get those numbers out of thin air.
878
He calls his customers, most of which are concentrated.
879
You can pick up the phone or telegram and say, hey, Mark, what's your capex spend forecast?
880
Because they have to do a capacity planning the other side.
881
They just coordinate.1 billion in AI orders.
882
That's Q1, surpassing the total shipments of all of FY25 and leaving us with a backlog of $14.4 billion.
883
If you look at other data center names, they all have this kind of story.
884
I can't find one that's not growing with a backlog, like Powell, Starling, Oracle, Corey.
885
Corey's got an $8 billion backlog.
886
So, yeah, the AI story is real.
887
Don't dismiss it.
888
You know, you're starting to see changes in the labor market, which I think people need to talk more about that.
889
Like, what does this mean in three years when humanoids come online and you see displacement?
890
You're seeing actually AI cause job cuts for software engineers at software companies.
891
So it's like tech eating tech.
892
So I think that's, you know, I'm optimistic on all this stuff, just to be clear.
893
But and productivity growth is the one free lunch in economics, right?
894
It's disinflation, it drives earnings, it drives productivity growth.
895
Incomes can go higher.
896
But I wouldn't count out the AI theme.
897
I think it's still a significant driver where we are.
898
Yeah, I'll chime in a little bit on this as well.
899
Two things.
900
One, Mary Meeker, who I think she used to be at Sequoia.
901
Is that right?
902
She was at Kleiner and then Morgan Samuel Cora.
903
Yeah, yeah.
904
So she released something like a 346-page report on AI.
905
I haven't gone through yet, but I saw some clips from it.
906
You know, it should be obvious to everyone at this point.
907
It's just happening at a massively accelerated pace.
908
So, you know, I'm not surprised seeing Michael Dell's tweet example or Jensen mentioning what he mentions and then over-delivering on it.
909
They're just, this is like, oh, iPhone and Androids are about to take over all of the internet.
910
So, like, everything associated with that just has to be built and go up, and there's a whole ecosystem around it, et cetera.
911
I will say the second point: so, I have a separate kind of stealthy software company where we've been building software for my fund for the past three years.
912
And we're not hiring engineers.
913
And, you know, I'm an engineer myself.
914
The team is five engineers at this point, five plus a really talented product manager.
915
And a lot of it has to do with how we're utilizing AI and building our own workflows and work streams to do certain things.
916
I will say that, you know, so at the beginning of the year, I've mentioned to my team, like, don't come to me with headcount requests if you haven't evaluated whether it can be done with AI or not.
917
And, you know, that's, I've seen this at Shopify and a handful of Duolingos doing this.
918
Like, there's other companies that are going this route.
919
I think it's wise not because it's meant to say we're not going to hire people, it's that it's forcing your kind of product managers and engineers to level up their skill set with the modern tooling that is available.
920
And so, you know, as an example, I don't think that currently today the models aren't good enough to be like using natural language and build some really complex back-end piece of code that's tied into, say, AWS or GCP.
921
It's just, it's still, there's still a level of complexity and then security concerns and risks associated with that.
922
That will be solved over time.
923
But there are cases to be made to say, hey, you know, if your front end, your web app, your user interface is using React, which is probably the most commonly used front-end framework on the planet, that's a standard tool set.
924
If there's standard UI components and styling and all these things, an AI model is pretty good at understanding that.
925
And so there is a case to be made that, like, hey, maybe some of the bug fixes or tweaks to your user interface or automated testing within your browser app or whatever the thing may actually be, that should be handled by AI because then it frees up your engineers to work on more complicated or more value-driving tasks.
926
And we're doing that at asymmetric with our software.
927
I know other companies are doing this as well.
928
You will absolutely see the media never let this story go of the solo founder that created a billion-dollar company.
929
It's never going to stop because that headline just is too juicy.
930
Does it happen?
931
Probably.
932
There are absolutely companies in Silicon Valley where it's one or two people and they've got to 10 million in ARR in 30, 45, 60 days.
933
And a lot of it has to do with how they're utilizing AI.
934
So as more of that starts to kind of permeate into the enterprise, you should start to see, I don't know if you're going to see these kind of mass layoffs in software developers, but it's going to change the role fundamentally.
935
And so, you know, she's about to go into college.
936
She's 18 years old, really smart woman.
937
And she was asking me, like, what should I, what should I, what do you think I should do?
938
Like, you know, going to college, I'm like, just get really good at prompting.
939
I've been thinking about this show, too.
940
I got small kids.
941
And the only thing you learn in college right now is prompting.
942
You're getting rewarded if you prompt better than someone else, which is terrible education.
943
It's really critical thinking.
944
Oh, yeah, yeah.
945
No need to focus.
946
But I agree with everything, I think you said, like, I think all these software engineers are getting laid off.
947
They're going to go found companies using AI also, which is another productivity cycle that we haven't seen yet.
948
Yeah, I mean, I think back, like, there's definitely going to be a lot of positives that come out of this, right?
949
Like, you talk about deflation, productivity growth.
950
There's going to be a lot of people that lose their jobs.
951
Hopefully, I'm not one of them, or none of you are one of them.
952
I mean, I'm a little bit younger than you guys.
953
And I just think, thank God I got into my role when I did, because it's getting to the point now where AI can do a lot of this.
954
When you start in a research role, you do a lot of the grunt work.
955
You're doing a lot of Excel work, modeling, and doing things like that.
956
And AI is getting really, really good at doing some of this stuff to the point where I don't really, like, I could see a point a few years from now where you might be like, I don't know if we need three associates or analysts to come help us with this stuff.
957
We just need one who's good at AI.
958
And I don't know what that does long term.
959
Everyone always complains about new technology destroying jobs long term.
960
And eventually a bunch of jobs are built on top of it.
961
Like over the long term, enough of it lays out, but there are people that get left behind.
962
And I think that's just, I don't know, that's just the way this is going to go.
963
Yeah, I'm just happy.
964
There is this called the lump of labor fallacy.
965
Folks should look it up or just go to ChatGP or Grock and have them explain.
966
The lump of labor fallacy assumes that there's a finite amount of work.
967
It's not true, right?
968
It's just simply not true.
969
And in fact, the internet itself in the 90s, people were saying this is going to be the end of so many industries.
970
What happened?
971
It's just the amount of wealth creation and middle-class mobility, I'd say globally, increased.
972
It's just simply not true.
973
It can be terrifying when it's your job, right?
974
And software developers are not, they're no longer impervious to this.
975
You know, software developers for probably the past 20 years have the world is their oyster.
976
Like they can just get a job anywhere, right?
977
That might be changing, which is one of the reasons why I always emphasize folks to be doing the kind of continuing education work on the latest and greatest tooling, irrespective of what your job is, because it's going to give you an edge against someone who's not.
978
Yeah, and I think, Joe, you've hit the nail on the head of the big, big, big shift here.
979
We've been through technological waves of layoffs before, but this time it's hitting white-collar.
980
I keep a track of white-collar layoffs.
981
And just last week, just last week, we saw McKinsey layoff 10%.
982
We saw Business Insider lay off 21%.
983
IBM laid off 8,000.
984
PWC, again, I may be off you on the dates on that.
985
But this is something that culturally in society we're just not used to seeing because you're told to go to university and you study computer science, you study economics.
986
And if, especially given the uncertainty that the young generation is dealing with on a daily basis with the world around them changing so much and how are they ever going to be able to afford a home and have a family kind of thing, now the job security that they were promised when they started their education is not there.
987
The winners from all this are owners of capital, right?
988
If you're a McKinsey shareholder, you need less associates running around, you'd be benefiting.
989
Same for Business Insider.
990
There are two types of capital: there's financial capital and then there's human capital.
991
And so, to Joe's point, if you've got a differentiated skill set, you'll do well.
992
The real winners are going to be founders.
993
Everyone should be learning how to be a founder because you've got to reinvent yourself, learn, go to founder university, whatever that might mean, instead of the four years, or go there and find someone, drop, build businesses.
994
I think that's the best return you can get for your education.
995
Invest in your own human capital.
996
Skip university because you can learn it online with the help of artificial intelligence.
997
Yeah, yeah, Rob, earlier when I was telling my babysitter, like, just get really good at prompting, my other alternative was selfishly, because I studied philosophy.
998
I was like, just go get a degree in philosophy.
999
I don't teach you how to think, right?
1000
Like, I learned that.
1001
Yeah, there was a study, I think it was in The Economist or something, a couple of weeks ago, saying that's the number one degree at the moment to get in the U.S.
1002
No idea.
1003
So was I.
1004
I learned that Joe's also a software engineer.
1005
Yes.
1006
Two farms.
1007
That is very, you see, here we have two examples of why that actually does matter.
1008
Yeah, critical thinking matters, sustained focus, grit, perseverance.
1009
And asking the right questions, because you know, Joe, pulling on your just learn how to prompt, it's more about asking the right questions.
1010
And in a world in which everything is changing so fast, the questions matter more than the answers.
1011
100%.
1012
Absolutely.
1013
Yeah, and I wanted to add, like, Meta also earlier this year got rid of 5% of its staff or is in the process of getting rid of thousands of people, which it's not, I think they said it's like 4,000 people, if I remember correctly, but like explicitly saying like they're getting rid of the low performers and going to lean on AI.
1014
And that's like, it's almost so meta.
1015
Like they're building AI, they're building open source stuff, and they're getting rid of the software engineers that are building it.
1016
It's just kind of, yeah, the ticker is meta.
1017
It's all very, very meta.
1018
Not even going to spin up divisions to go build product offerings.
1019
You're not going to have a business unit leader.
1020
I'm trying to terminate myself.
1021
We're building a Google VEO3 avatar, and it's trained on all my newsletters, and it's going to spit something out hopefully next week or two.
1022
But literally, I'm looking at my workflows and I say, all right, which of these can I systematize in AI?
1023
Well, I need to be doing more with AI, it sounds like.
1024
There's a lot of other things we wanted to get to.
1025
We went over as usual.
1026
Well, next week we'll talk a little bit about the FTEX bankruptcy distributions and a few other things, but that's enough for now.
1027
All right.
1028
Thanks for joining us for this episode of Bits and Bips.
1029
We'll be back in one week to discuss more about how the worlds of crypto and macro are colliding.
1030
Until then, everyone.
