--- METADATA END ---

1
Has anything changed in your reviews over the last few weeks on inflation, where rates are going, or any of that?
2
Everything's changed.
3
I'm becoming more convinced we're not going to see rate cuts this year.
4
I agree with that.
5
Maybe in the last quarter, but certainly nothing in it.
6
Hi, everyone.
7
Welcome to Bits and Bips, exploring how crypto and macro collide one basis point at a time.
8
Today, we'll talk about Consensus 2025, Trump, as usual, some news around Coinbase, some news around Circle, the stable coin bill, which is the biggest news of the day today.
9
And then also, we obviously have to get into the U.S.
10
credit downgrade by Moody.
11
But first, some quick intros.

41
First thing we have to do is, one, it's always nice when we have just the roundtable of four of the six of us who are the recurring guests.
42
So this doesn't happen all that often.
43
We usually have guests, which are also great.
44
But let's go into the biggest news, the Moody's downgrade.
45
Let's go to Noel here to give us the background because we were talking before we even went live here, and there's some disagreement a little bit, but I think that like 90%, 90% of it we agree on.
46
But let's hear from Noel here and then we'll get into some conversation.
47
The big story is that on Friday after the stock market closed, Moody's, the rating agency, announced that it was officially downgrading the credit status of U.S.
48
government debt.
49
Now, this is not a surprise.
50
For the details, it's downgraded now from the pristine level AAA to AA1, which is one below, still pretty good, but not the pristine level that people expect when they think of the world's risk-free asset.
51
It's not a surprise, as I was saying, because Moody's said back, I think it was in 2023, that they were putting this on a negative watch.
52
So, in other words, this was coming, also Standard and Poor's SP Global, I should say.
53
They downgraded in 2011 and Fitch downgraded in 2023.
54
So, the U.S.
55
government debt has not been pristine for some time.
56
What we were talking about earlier was: does this make any difference to markets?
57
Fundamentally, not much has changed.
58
One, because it's largely priced in.
59
Again, not a surprise.
60
Two, because it's not going to change who can buy U.S.
61
government debt.
62
That big move was back in 2011 when SP downgraded.
63
Those that could buy U.S.
64
government debt last week can still buy U.S.
65
government debt.
66
Where it does matter is whether they will actually want to.
67
My view is that while fundamentally not much changes, the messaging here is important, especially given the timing around the debates on the tax bill.
68
Who wants to jump in next?
69
Ron, any grand thoughts on the movies downgrade?
70
I think there's notable to call out that the rates actually tighten today after the downgrade.
71
Now, there are technical constraints on certain managers that can't buy AAA rated debt.
72
So, when it loses that AAA rating, then they may have to seek a revision to their mandates to permit them to invest in U.S.-grade debt.
73
That's one.
74
Two, this is because we have 8% deficits.
75
We have wartime deficits that are running, and we haven't seen any austerity.
76
We haven't seen any bell tightening.
77
You know, the budgets that have been proposed just are increasing spending overall.
78
That's bullish for markets, bullish for the economy, to be clear, but it doesn't help the debt-to-GDP picture.
79
So, you know, it's politicians kicking the can very predictably.
80
Once again, it is bullish for digital assets.
81
It's bullish for a number of digital asset names.
82
I know we'll come back to that soon.
83
I think a very interesting question is: where do rates go from here?
84
And I'd love to get the perspective of folks on it.
85
On the one hand, you've got continued disinflationary forces, which you see in improving inflation prints.
86
And Trump over the weekend said Walmart should, quote unquote, eat the tariffs.
87
So you've got the prospect of that potentially impacting prices.
88
And on the social media Twitter sphere, there's a big debate on whether rates are going to 5% or we're topping here.
89
Both sides have a lot of conviction.
90
So let me say on Moody's, first, I mean, this is kind of like, I mean, it's backwards looking, but anyway, I was expecting on the news 50 vips to 1% move on the SP.
91
I think we got a little bit more, and I really thought and still think it's a one-day thing because as Noel said very clearly, it doesn't affect who can buy, which means it doesn't affect contracts, which is something that actually happened somewhat in 2011.
92
And there were changes in how contracts of basically sovereign swaps are written that they don't include credit scores any longer.
93
So there's been no impact in who can buy.
94
And it was in fixed income circles, it was widely anticipated.
95
And furthermore, it's a third agency to fall in line.
96
SP in 2011, Fitch in 2023, and now Moody's.
97
So it's kind of like a non-event.
98
It is a non-event, just a one-day thing.
99
2023 was going to be the way I see it is, it was...
100
was meant to be a non-event until basically was picked up by Ackman, who basically triggered one of the most incredible things I've ever seen in financial markets, which was basically Ackman moving the Treasury market as if it were a shitcoin.
101
It was incredible.
102
And yeah, well, let's.
103
I want to push back on the idea that this would be good for crypto.
104
I mean, I'm personally bullish, as you all know, but there is a scenario in which maybe this is not good for crypto, and that is if indeed this does maybe not trigger a correction, but encourage the continuation of the correction that has been building, except for the rally that we've seen since the China Agreement.
105
So if there is a correction, and Alex is totally right in pointing out that the previous two downgrades did trigger a correction, this time is different, then arguably crypto short-term would follow the stock market down.
106
Why would it do that?
107
I mean, hopefully moods will, hopefully Alex is right and it's just a very short-term thing, but what if it isn't?
108
Because the last two times we didn't have sovereigns exiting US government debt market anyway.
109
So by sovereigns I mean foreign buyers.
110
We've got the foreign buyer report from the U.S.
111
Treasury Department on Friday, which showed that in February and March, foreign buyers actually accumulated more US government debt than in any other two-month back-to-back period.
112
In April, we've seen the exodus of foreign buyers from the U.S.
113
government debt market, and this is just another excuse for them to continue to do so, yet another justification to their clients or their bosses that this is the strategy to continue with, which is why I think that fundamentally this is a nothing burger, but in terms of messaging, it could have some impact.
114
If we do see yields go up, which I expect, then that should impact stock market valuations.
115
Even if just earnings, then the valuations of discounted cash flows, which I know are an old thing, but they do matter.
116
When yields go up, the stock market does tend to wobble.
117
And if the stock market wobbles, then crypto tends to wobble too, at least short term.
118
We saw in the banking crisis in 2023 crypto and Bitcoin shoot up, but this isn't a banking crisis.
119
You know, it's like I don't agree with it being good for Bitcoin.
120
I think it's truly a non-event for Bitcoin stocks in general.
121
But something when this kind of thing happens, this is the way I look at the market.
122
Others may disagree, but for me, when there's an event that happens and it fully retraces on the same day across assets, it's a non-event.
123
It doesn't come back the day after or the week after it's done.
124
Market processed it and moved on.
125
One more thing is this thing, the downgrade, did generate quite a bit of panic in crypto circles.
126
And I think it's an interesting phenomenon that actually talks about how basically positioning in crypto is tratifies in Bitcoin, and crypto natives are in altcoins mostly.
127
So as soon as they start rolling over, people get very, very uncomfortable.
128
In the meantime, Bitcoin barely, you know, it didn't really matter that much if you think about it.
129
Yeah, overall, I agree.
130
I mean, it's like a buy the rumor, sell the news event as it relates to bonds.
131
You know, my view is that you're closer to the high in yields rather than the low in yields.
132
You still are seeing some slowdown in economic activity.
133
We haven't felt the effects of tariff.
134
Real income growth rates are slowing versus inflation.
135
So I think you're probably seeing that high.
136
But it is notable that Bitcoin is at this key technical level, and it's a make-or-break technical level.
137
And if you look at U.S.
138
equities, too, they're also similarly, they've had a 22% plus run off the bottom, which is the median run that you get off of a correction of that depth where the VIX achieved the level it had.
139
And where we go from here will be very telling.
140
I would not be surprised to expect some consolidation this week.
141
It would be natural, it would be very healthy.
142
There is an argument to be made that the run we saw in Bitcoin yesterday has nothing at all to do with the Moody's downgrade, just from the timing.
143
It started right when Scott Besant was on the CNN Meet the Nation show.
144
And he said that we are going to be focusing on increasing GDP.
145
That did not send the message of austerity, and he didn't mention at all bringing the deficit down.
146
So, obviously, the message was we're going to keep on with this fiscal stimulus.
147
And I think that is what pushed Bitcoin up yesterday.
148
So, it went up, came down, but not to do, we haven't yet seen the reaction from the downgrade.
149
You're right.
150
I went to see my cardiologist on Friday, first time in a decade.
151
And he actually thinks it will be healthier for me if Bitcoin goes up, to be honest.
152
I'm sorry, Ron.
153
I can't imagine there's less stress, right?
154
You're going to get less cortisol and more dopamine in your bloodstream.
155
Yeah.
156
So, Besant, yeah, Noel, to your point, you know, he said, Hey, we're going to outgrow debt through growth, which is a supply-side answer, right?
157
Now, I asked Grok, which I love, Grok is my favorite AI, indispensable now, but I asked Grok to do a side-by-side table of GDP growth versus debt growth.
158
And this is what you see: it's very hard for GDP to outrun debt growth.
159
If you want a strong GDP year, you've got to increase debt in the prior year.
160
You've got to have a lot of spending.
161
That's what you see here in 2021.
162
But all to say is there's no fiscal austerity, it's spending.
163
The spending will continue.
164
In fact, if you look at the stocks of defense contractors, they're back to all-time high.
165
Remember, there's some discussion a few months ago about Trump saying, Hey, can we do a global peace deal and cut defense by 50%?
166
You also had all these primes, for example, Booz Anne.
167
Their stocks were smashed and they're recovering now.
168
So U.S.
169
fiscal spending is back, never stopped, really.
170
Well, never, yeah, never went away.
171
Never went away.
172
And the bill that they're currently debating, I mean, it did actually finally get through the committee last night, which again, extraordinary to be blocked in the rubber stamp committee.
173
So that's, again, a sign that could have some rocky path ahead.
174
But it is quite astonishing in just how much it is going to be increasing, not just the deficit, but also the outstanding debt.
175
And yet they're still talking about Doge doing its thing and bringing down spending.
176
Yeah, I mean, I want to go back to something that Ron brought up about how, like, you know, Trump going after Walmart, saying you can't, like, increase your prices and all this stuff.
177
It's just like, it reminds me a lot.
178
It's so funny because you see it in both political parties.
179
They like to defy that there's consequences to their actions.
180
And Trump's like, just eat the losses.
181
And the Democrats did stuff like this left and right under Biden.
182
Like, this is not actually a negative consequence for these things.
183
But whatever.
184
It's just like, it feels like the same exact playbook on that front.
185
I just wanted to throw it in there because you brought it up real quick, Ron.
186
I go to Walmart this weekend.
187
You know, what you do when you get older on your birthday, you buy gifts for everyone else, food and drink for everyone else, like it's for a kudo card.
188
So I went to Walmart.
189
By the way, it's a reminder, this is like the eighth wonder of the world.
190
And somehow it just got better from since the last time I was in Walmart.
191
The selection, the variety, and this time when I was in Walmart, I was looking at it from that lens: hey, can they pass prices on?
192
So, two fun facts.
193
One is, Walmart.9%, their gross margin is 30%, the difference between their fixed cost and overhead and all the rest.
194
My conclusion from this is Walmart will have no problem passing prices to consumers.
195
In fact, you don't even notice it.
196
Their board games, you can get there, like the monopolies of the world, like $12.50.
197
If that goes to 15, no one's going to notice.
198
It's not going to make a difference.
199
So, from a retail merchandise perspective, I'm not really that concerned.
200
I'm more focused on what tariffs mean for semiconductors, because you've got hyperscalers spending hundreds of billions of dollars over the next few years on semiconductor chips.
201
And if you want to maintain a leading dominant role in AI from a national security perspective, which is what Trump admin policy wants, I think is a good policy.
202
How do you square that with tariffs on semiconductors?
203
Do you make the tariff level higher or lower because they're strategic to national security?
204
I'd argue lower, but at the same time, you want to incentivize domestic production.
205
Yes.
206
You're setting that, I guess.
207
Dollar General, Dollar Tree, all those stocks have been rallying, by the way.
208
Because if you're going to buy a product for a dollar from these stores, you've got to import from China.
209
So they've benefited from this.
210
A little bit off topic, but I mean, one of the points of having the biggest military by a very large margin in the world is that you can have your production wherever you want because you have the military.
211
You can take control and protect anything.
212
So I always think that this view that., to be stronger, it's misplaced.
213
It's mostly a narrative for boats.
214
It's not an exact thing.
215
I used to have that view too.
216
I still do.
217
Like, if the United States has 11 aircraft carrier, we can project force, et cetera.
218
Our defense spending versus Europe and the world combined, it's like we're still the leader.
219
But then these Houthis, what's up with the Houthis?
220
F-18 fell off a carrier, allegedly.
221
Some other F-18s were, you know, they were not in commission.
222
We did like a deal with the Houthis.
223
What's going on?
224
What's the relevance?
225
Carriers are expensive, drones aren't.
226
Right.
227
Like the American military force is not modern for the threats that we see.
228
Noel, to your point.
229
Which is interesting.
230
It's interesting when you step back and remember that for years we've been told that what protects the status of the dollar?
231
The U.S.
232
military.
233
The Houthis.
234
It's amazing to see that the U.S.
235
had to cut a deal with the Houthis against the desires and interests of Saudi Arabia and Israel, by the way.
236
Yeah, and then again, there's also some doubts whether that is indeed what happened.
237
Did they cut a deal with the Houthis?
238
The Houthis are not convinced of this, it seems.
239
Is that right?
240
Apparently, the article I had read was that the United States is spending a billion dollars a month combating the Houthis for limited material progress.
241
A billion dollars a month is actually nothing by the U.S.
242
Defense Department.
243
It's like absolutely nothing, it's nothing.
244
But it does feed into the outlook for the dollar, which we touched on earlier, which is relevant to the downgrade.
245
The dollar is not the safe haven it used to be.
246
When Fitch downgraded in 2023, US yields went down because although the US government debt was downgraded, people rushed into it as a safe haven.
247
And that is not something we're seeing this time.
248
There are other safe havens.
249
Gold rallied on the news.
250
Gold seems to be continuing to do quite well today.
251
Bitcoin still has its dual narrative struggle going on.
252
Do you guys have any strong views?
253
And has anything changed in your reviews over the last few weeks on inflation, where rates are going, or any of that?
254
Everything's changed.
255
I'm becoming more convinced we're not going to see rate cuts this year.
256
I agree with that.
257
Maybe in the last quarter, but certainly nothing imminent.
258
I think we'll see cuts maybe the last quarter.
259
I don't think it matters that much.
260
And as usually you buy into that liquidity is everything narrative, which is very flawed.
261
What matters is growth and earnings mainly in this market.
262
And yield curve control.
263
I mean, we know that they have to bring yields down.
264
Yields are not going to come down naturally, especially if inflation expectations remain high, as does uncertainty.
265
So some kind of yield code control we're likely to see by the fourth quarter, because otherwise the deficit situation is just going to get untenable.
266
Interest is a greater percentage of the debt of the deficit now than of spending.
267
And that's not productive spending.
268
So, they're going to have to come up with some way to massage the yields down one way or another.
269
So, I would say that the views all shared here I would describe as consensus views.
270
I think we'd all agree they're consensus too.
271
The point being, though, that what creates surprise to markets, what moves pricing, will be something non-consensus.
272
And I think that view, and I actually have this view, is that you will get a bout of stagflation over the summer when the tariff policy after 90 days is there.
273
And I believe the floor in tariffs will be 10%.
274
You saw that in the UK deal, where we raised our sales taxes, EG tariffs, and UK lower theirs, and that's an ally.
275
That's going to be a template for what a good deal looks like.
276
So, that will create a bout of inflation over the summer.
277
But I think it'll be digested, it'll get worked through.
278
The other thing that often happens in June, July, August is you get some seasonal weakness in initial claims and employment.
279
Happened last summer, happened the summer before that.
280
You know, last summer it caused a growth scare, fear.
281
And right now, markets aren't priced for that.
282
Markets right now are priced for the consensus story, which was just shared.
283
One thing I've been thinking about a lot recently is: you know, yeah, we pretty much agree on that rates cuts are going to be pushed back, if at all, and that the outlook for crypto is positive medium-term.
284
But what if we're wrong?
285
Rather than ask what.
286
How could we be wrong here?
287
Let's go anti-consensus.
288
Yeah, I mean, just to throw in some data here, we were just a week ago, two weeks ago, we were pricing for a cut pretty heavily, a possibility of June and even a very high probability of a cut by July.
289
We've pushed that out to the September meeting.
290
I'm probably, I think something's going to happen.
291
I think we're still going to get another cut or two.
292
I think Trump's going to get what he wants in this set of cut.
293
So right now we're basically pricing for one cut by September and then pricing for another two cuts by before the end of December, so before the end of the year.
294
And then the third cut is expected to come sometime in January or March.
295
That's what the markets are saying right now.
296
I'll go against you guys saying you don't know if there's going to be a cut this year.
297
I think we see a cut this year.
298
And I think it happens in September at the latest.
299
Well, I would say a good non-consensus angle on this, by the way, James, I think that kind of squares with how I see things too, but is Renaissance macro and Neil Dutta.
300
And he was very kind of bearish in summer of last year and anticipated these rate cuts.
301
I disagree with those rate cuts and employment data has been nothing but strong and corporate earnings have been strong.
302
But that kind of doesn't matter if you're in the policy view and you've got to make a decision.
303
But he has a recession call out there and he's citing weaker government hiring, including at the state and local level.
304
There's also data around tax receipts.
305
Tax receipts are not a real-time variable.
306
It's like a near-time variable.
307
And if you look at real income versus inflation, your real income is declining below inflation, which is not a good picture.
308
Housing data remains weak.
309
Housing is a big driver of the economy, of course, but like we're not, we're seeing inventory backlogs build, right?
310
The mortgage rates are elevated right now.
311
I don't think they can go much higher than here, but they're still elevated.
312
So that is the summer story that I think plays out maybe end of June, somewhere through July, August, September.
313
And you have 21 times earnings on the SP again.
314
So you can't really go from 21 to 22.
315
You need a lot of trust and forward-looking clarity to get higher than that.
316
I just don't see that happening.
317
So, you know, I think SP at 6,000 is close to fair value.
318
We're at fair value right around now, ish, right?
319
Still bullish between now and year end, but I think you're fairly priced versus that alternative story, which I think will start to come into the foreground.
320
But you're assuming that we're not going to be any significant EPS forecast reductions, which if indeed we do see the bite from tariffs and we do see the employment slowdown, then we will.
321
I've been, again, coming at it from the other way.
322
It's December, imagining here.
323
It's cold outside.
324
We've had three cuts.
325
Why have we had three cuts?
326
And the only thing I think that would trigger that kind of thing is if things are really bad out there, if unemployment is shooting up, sure, that would make them, that would brute, that would, that's within the Fed's reaction function.
327
Or if the treasury market has totally seized.
328
And also, another question to throw out there is: why do we think the Fed would only do a 25 basis point cut if it's going to do one?
329
As Alex says, that would do absolutely nothing at all.
330
That's like swatting a fly off of a hippo.
331
If it's going to move, it would probably move big to send a message that the market would actually notice.
332
But they did adjustment cuts in Q4 of this past year.
333
Why weren't it the same?
334
Just managing the real rate of interest, which is what they look at.
335
I don't think they should look at that, but they do look at that, right?
336
So the real interest rates remain elevated.
337
We should pull up a chart on that.
338
But they are way too high.
339
That's why the FOMC officials believe that policy is currently restrictive.
340
I think they're wrong.
341
I think the high real interest rate reflects strong underlying economic growth.
342
And you're not going to get a recession.
343
You're going to get labor hoarding.
344
Consumer spending is still fine.
345
But you do have the conditions for another summer growth scare.
346
They could do adjustment cuts, Noah, though, right?
347
I mean, to your point, I think they could just do two or three adjustment cuts just as inflation comes down.
348
If inflation comes down.
349
Right, right.
350
The summer could throw a curveball on that, too.
351
Alex, what do you think about that?
352
Interesting to hear.
353
Well, a couple of things.
354
The summer data, I don't think it's going to be very important.
355
I think the market is going to look through because with the payload and tariffs, if it's maintained, which I don't see any reason to believe it won't be maintained, we have what they signal is that we have a very pragmatic administration capable.
356
Yeah, I do think.
357
I think it's fine.
358
I don't think it matters that much.
359
It would matter if it were higher than that.
360
So, what I tried to say is that the growth scare is not going to scare anyone.
361
And the other thing I think I wanted to point out is on the yield curve control, that's consensus in crypto only.
362
It's not consensus outside of crypto.
363
And it's actually something pushed by some large influencers in crypto who are wrong over 50% of the time.
364
That's not going to happen.
365
Not really in the way.
366
If we see it, it would be extremely bullish because it's not priced in.
367
And I don't think it's going to happen because we're very far away from an emergency situation where the U.S.
368
has to take such an extraordinary measure.
369
It would be extraordinary.
370
Not that extraordinary.
371
I mean, it's happened before in history, and it certainly happened around the world.
372
And we are becoming, in terms of the debt policy, more and more like Japan.
373
So I hear people suggesting this in the macro newsletters I read.
374
I haven't heard it that much in the crypto circles.
375
You're totally right.
376
Crypto people tend to not fully understand Fed policy and they tend to see what they want to see there.
377
So again, I wouldn't consider myself a crypto native at all, but I do think that this is what we're going to see because I don't think there's any alternative.
378
And I do think that we're going to be taking a page out of Japan.
379
I mean, there's a runoff naturally, anyways.
380
We just might see that tilt in a certain direction.
381
Yeah, it's true.
382
This is mini-Japan.
383
So, check out this chart here.
384
Saw this from the Bannel Flow Show report, but it shows a summary of the quote, big, beautiful bill.
385
And you can see some of the savings and cost components.
386
So, a big cost line item in the budget is extending the Trump 1.0 tax cuts.
387
Okay, now that's not incremental.
388
That's a continuation.
389
You know, that stimulates for people that have concerns about tax cuts going away.
390
I don't think it stimulates that much, though, because it is the current state of affairs.
391
Then you've got new tax cuts, which is $700 billion.
392
However, you've got these tariffs on the bottom left.
393
They call that savings or revenue.
394
Those are sales taxes.
395
Those sales taxes will be borne by corporates and small businesses.
396
Now, if you're a small business owner, it'll be and consumers, yes.
397
Thank you.
398
Correct.
399
It'll be some split across the provider, service, and the consumer.
400
For the small businesses, those tariffs will be felt like an increase of their marginal tax rate.
401
If you import from China, Vietnam, and you sell that hockey stick or on Shopify or whatever it is, furniture, your marginal tax rate's effectively going up.
402
The sub-150K population is likely to get a tax cut.
403
So it's actually a kind of redistribution, right?
404
So high-income earners, shareholders, and big corporates, and then small business owners, they're going to get a tax hike that funds a tax cut for sub-150K, which is, you know, it's a populist economic policy.
405
I'm not for that policy, by the way.
406
I think if you're benefiting from services of the state and federal government, you should have some stake in the system.
407
You should pay taxes, even if it's small.
408
You know, you should have some stake in that so you feel some accountability towards your elected officials to maintain some kind of cost discipline.
409
Yeah, I mean, it's just crazy.
410
Like, I mean, on there, it was like $2.7 trillion deficit added.
411
And it's just like, I thought we weren't doing that.
412
I thought the whole point of this was we weren't going to do this anymore.
413
And here we are.
414
It's like a 34% increase, which is not trivial.
415
It's going to be great for your corporate earnings growth, by the way.
416
So I'm bullish on this.
417
It's good for markets, for sure.
418
Definitely good for market.
419
And this is a way that yield curve control can come in the back door that we don't even notice.
420
I mean, we assume that by yield curve control, and this is perhaps why Alex thinks that it's largely in the crypto native sector, that the Fed's going to come in and just buy the bonds.
421
That's not the only way to do yield control.
422
Another way, which I think we're going to see, is changing bank regulations, so changing the capital rules and encouraging banks to buy 10 years or 20 years.
423
And, you know, by the way, you'll get some tax rebates if you do.
424
For instance, and again, bullish, bullish for crypto.
425
Well, you're right, Hon.
426
I mean, that's going to happen.
427
Bank of America did this, of course, right?
428
Bank of America was buying.
429
And now they've got $100 billion hold to maturity loss because of that.
430
But yeah, the regulation will waive the supplemental leverage rule, make it easier for banks to buy bonds.
431
But that's not, is that really in the best interest of banks to own bonds from the quality of their balance sheet?
432
Not necessarily, but that's not the priority.
433
I was going to say two things.
434
Ron, you were talking about the housing market.
435
The housing market nationally is correcting.
436
Like it's coming back from the hotness of COVID.
437
But it's very regional.
438
I mean, Texas and Florida, where a lot of people move for multiple reasons, insurance, other things like that, just got too hot.
439
They're getting hit the hardest.
440
But like up in the Northeast, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, like it's through a very, very, very tight, hot housing market right now.
441
And it's actually going the opposite direction for the rest of the nation, which is fascinating to me.
442
I mean, obviously, I'm not a real estate analyst, but I like watching this stuff because I find it so fascinating.
443
The other thing I'd say, we were talking about unemployment and stuff.
444
One thing that shout out to Anna Wong, the Bloomberg economist, like she's been talking about this, like the amount of time that people are taking to find new jobs has extended a lot.
445
So we're not seeing a tick up in unemployment, but we are seeing some weakness.
446
And I think Neil Dutta at Renmac has talked about this as well.
447
There is a bit of a decent amount of softening in the employment market.
448
So I think that's another area where we should be watching.
449
I don't know if we'll see hoarding.
450
And the last thing I wanted to say that I've heard multiple people talking about Josh Brown over at Woodholtz and some other people, one of the unique things about the stock market might be that these top high-flying big names in equities.
451
Like when you have, even if we go into like a minor recession, like some people are calling for in the next year or two, like it might be that the biggest names of the S<unk>P 500 hold up better than the vast majority of other names.
452
Like it used to be, you know, manufacturers and all these companies that were subject to the cycle.
453
But like if you go into a recession, are you really going to get rid of your $20 Netflix subscription?
454
Are you going to really stop paying a couple dollars for added memory from your Google Cloud and all these things?
455
These are things that are kind of just embedded.
456
You're going to stop going out to dinner maybe or stop doing other things more frequently that more likely than you're going to stop spending money at these Mag 7 type names.
457
Obviously, that's not true for all of them, but we could be at a point where these bigger stocks, massive earnings, decent earnings growth, might actually hold up better than a lot of the smaller cap stocks and mid-cap stocks, the things that you would normally think like the high-flying growth names get hit the hardest.
458
But that might not be the case in the next potential recession.
459
The consumption basket has to shift though.
460
If real incomes aren't keeping up with inflation, there's got to be some shift.
461
I agree with your point on these consumer staples, essentially, some of these tech companies.
462
I'll share an anecdote with you.
463
So when I was in upstate New York this weekend, I had dinner with a friend.
464
He's a general manager of a factory that manufactures Kevlar vests and other equipment for the U.S.
465
military.
466
Small town upstate New York, local manufacturing, and they import silver from overseas.
467
I said, what are the challenges you have in your business?
468
And he said, we can't hire people.
469
We can't get jobs.
470
I said, what do you mean?
471
Upstate New York is suffering from higher unemployment than New York State's well-known issue.
472
He said, no, no, no.
473
Then they go on unemployment benefits, and the cycle repeats.
474
And the wage for New York State, I don't know what the minimum wage is, maybe it's 18 or 20, somewhere around there, but it's much higher than, say, like South Carolina.
475
So that's another dynamic here.
476
So to your point, James, on people are looking for work longer.
477
No, if you want to qualify for unemployment benefit, you've got to raise your hand and say, hey, look, I was looking for work.
478
Therefore, I qualify for unemployment benefits.
479
I just couldn't find it.
480
And it goes back to like helping mainstream.
481
This is the mainstream.
482
That's an aspect of mainstream.
483
Like, I'm all for small business mainstream, like entrepreneurs.
484
That's an entrepreneur.
485
He can't get the labor he wants due to policy that's counterproductive, and taxpayers are funding that.
486
And that's inflationary, right?
487
Like, that, by the way, that's like a quasi-form of universal basic income.
488
New York State, essentially, you've got a basic introduction to universal basic income, and it's not helping the economy.
489
They're people that are just kind of living and not working and rotating from the benefit to the next.
490
If they get the job, then rotate to the next.
491
Gain the system.
492
I mean, I heard about that being anecdotally from other people being a much bigger problem.
493
A couple of years ago, the people that I talked to that were having that problem, including like my mother, for she works at a doctor's office, and they had like the same issue.
494
People would come in and then basically not do the work.
495
And like they were fine with getting fired because they would just collect unemployment.
496
But that hasn't been the case from the other people I talked to.
497
It started with COVID, but that funny thing, the second person I had over dinner was actually a doctor who shared that exactly what you just said.
498
But it's a post-COVID phenomenon, right?
499
It's a post-COVID behavior change.
500
Now, it's still not at those levels.
501
Does anyone else have anything on macro before we move to crypto?
502
Quickly, you guys mentioned housing.
503
Just wanted to say, like, I had a podcast last week on macro with one of these crypto podcasts.
504
And one of the guests basically had this extremely gloomy outlook about how the U.S.
505
is going to implode in Q4 and onwards because of the housing market.
506
And had these charts which basically point out what you guys were talking about, that the demand in housing, it's a weakening market, right?
507
A lot of people are actually moving away from buying to renting.
508
There's quite a few metrics that show that it's a weakened market.
509
However, the balance sheets of U.S.
510
households are very strong.
511
So the housing market can continue going south for a very long time.
512
It doesn't mean we're going to see, and we will not see, I would sign that with blood, a replay of 2008.
513
The housing market is not what defines the economy going forward in the U.S.
514
It's when I worry about it, a lot of things, worry about tariffs, worry about hyperscalers, investments and maybe layoffs happening, worry about yields going above now like the 10 years at 4.5%, the 10-year going to 5%, anything above 4.7%, 4.8% is reasonably concerned.
515
We're not there yet.
516
But there are many things that you can be worried about if you want to, which is what we do in macroland.
517
We find things to be worried about.
518
Housing market, I don't think, is one of them.
519
Especially if yields come down.
520
Fair enough, fair enough.
521
I agree.
522
I think yields, it's hard to see yields going higher than here.
523
But Alex, what would you say is priced in?
524
I think it's less helpful to say what will happen in macro because markets are perpetually discounting the future.
525
By the time you arrive at the summit, you're looking at the fall.
526
And it's more interesting to say what's priced in relative to expectations.
527
I think you've got close to Goldilocks priced in.
528
I would say, you know, like discretionary names and tech has run up quite a bit.
529
They probably take a breather here.
530
And like defensives and healthcare and rate-sensitive names, even like real estate names, maybe start to rally.
531
But it seems to me at 21 times earnings, wouldn't you say that you're back at pricing in Goldilocks as a base case?
532
It's what you said.
533
It's fairly priced.
534
That means that we can run up a lot higher.
535
It's fairly priced.
536
And we have, in the meantime, we have a carrots.
537
Trump is a purveyor of carrots right now.
538
It's like these deals are not yet done.
539
We have an extra 50 days of carrot land.
540
He's going to give us deals.
541
And then we have the taxes, the fiscal package.
542
I mean, like, I think things are fairly priced right now.
543
Sentiment, I've been looking at a Brazilian sentiment metrics and positioning metrics, too many to point it, single anyone out.
544
The positioning, from what I see, I would say is slightly underweight risk, which usually means we continue higher.
545
Things don't, something bad happens, something very bad happens, not movies, right?
546
Yeah, I think the multiples you're talking about is one reason, another reason for potentially, maybe not a recession, but like more like a flat-lined market or not a massive up market like we've been used to the last couple of years, because things are priced, like you said, they're fairly valued or at least priced to like things going really well.
547
And then I know, before we pass it over to Ram, I do want to say something else in the housing market because something I've noticed, I think we should get, somebody should do the study about all these people who are super bearish in the housing market, big names, and where they live.
548
Like if they live in Florida or they live in Texas or they live in California in certain areas where like Airbnbs were huge and the market got really hot, like people kind of like, they do this thing where they like, this is the whole like national housing market and can't be like, well, yeah, there's a bubble in this like regional market or this city or what have you.
549
And they can't like grasp that maybe like it's just that area, which is likely to happen.
550
It doesn't mean it's national housing market.
551
The other point I want to make is you draw more people are renting than buying.
552
Somebody who's moving, like there are, the rent versus buy scenario right now is so broken.
553
And it's not a problem for many people as long as they still have a job because they have a 30-year fixed rate.
554
We're not like other countries around the world where you have to, your payment goes up as rates went up and inflation goes up.
555
Like maybe your taxes and insurance are going up, but for the most part, your mortgage payment is flat.
556
And I'm looking at stuff.
557
And if you were to buy like the same house, even after you do a 20% down payment, your monthly payment is equivalent to potentially hot than the rents in the areas that I'm looking.
558
So it's like, all right, you have to pay all these fees to buy a house.
559
You were 20% down.
560
And it's like, okay, I'm just going to rent the equivalent condo or house or whatever.
561
I'm not going to buy.
562
And until things settle, either rates come down or prices of houses come down, I think that's just going to be the situation for the housing market, which I've heard a lot of people who haven't looked at this don't realize how like offside so many things are.
563
And it's just because people are trapped in their homes.
564
If you own a home, you're not giving up your 2.5%, 3% mortgage, and you're fine.
565
It doesn't matter to you.
566
I just want to share this chart back to Alex's point of position.
567
I do think this is one of the most critical variables in the market.
568
So, what this shows is the percentile of long-short positioning for hedge funds.
569
Hedge funds are marginal price centers in the market, right?
570
You also have long-lonely buyers.
571
This is a thing we've been talking about the last several weeks.
572
Last week, I believe that the net exposure of a hedge fund was around 7% in the backdrop of a market that's rallying 15 out of 18 days.
573
And you can see on that right-hand side of the chart that their net exposure has increased off the lows, but it's still significantly below historical levels.
574
So, this is a performance chase.
575
They have to invest.
576
They have to buy.
577
You see that today.
578
You had Moody's downgrade.
579
SP had a gap down open.
580
And the indices covered enclosed green.
581
So hedge funds are covering shorts.
582
They have to stay long.
583
You can also see consumer staples were net sold this week.
584
They're net sold because they're rotating out of this crouch position and buying Costco at 50 times and they're buying anything else that gives them some more upside.
585
So I agree.
586
I think this is a critical.
587
I do think that at 21 times earnings, indices are actually close to fully value, but then sectors within that are mispriced opportunity.
588
That's why healthcare is rallying right now.
589
So, I think you're going to get a natural rotation.
590
Technology rally very quickly, discretionary rally quickly because there's no recession.
591
I think they can still go some more, but these other sectors are going to benefit from rotation.
592
Now, we're seeing that happen now.
593
All right, let's move on to crypto because we're in pretty deep and we haven't done any of the bits part of bits and bips.
594
So, before we do that, let's hear from our sponsors who make the show possible.
595
Hi, it's Matt Hogan, the chief investment officer for Bitwise Asset Management.
596
Earlier this week, the U.S.
597
Senate took a huge step forward towards passing stablecoin legislation.
598
I think it's the biggest regulatory development to impact crypto since the approval of Bitcoin ETFs in January of 2024.

608
I guess I'll just start real quick with ConsenSys because I was the only one there from the crew out in Toronto.
609
Honestly, I heard people were worried about a lot of people showing up.
610
Also, anyone I know who lives in Canada that's involved in this space or launches part of the ETF industry, they were all there.
611
So it was awesome to me because I cover the spaces, obviously.
612
I think there was over 10,000 people there.
613
I will say I went to ConsenSys in Austin in, I guess, 22 was the most, the first one after COVID.
614
And half the people there, half the boost there, I was like, I've never heard of any of these projects.
615
I don't know what is going on here.
616
Talking to a lot of wacky people.
617
But I will tell you, the amount of people and clients and high-quality panels that I sat on, granted, I focused on the more things that I focused on, you know, the DeFi and TradFi overlaps, those bridges, staking and ETFs, liquidity providers, all these different things.
618
So I was focused on the areas that I covered more specifically.
619
And I got to say, they put on a hell of an event.
620
It was great.
621
Toronto's awesome.
622
Next year, they're going to be in Miami.
623
So I'm very much looking forward.
624
I prefer Miami and Toronto.
625
But yeah, so it was, I thought it was a great event.
626
I don't really have anything like groundbreaking or anything that I thought was groundbreaking.
627
Just overall, I thought it was extremely well done and looking forward to next year.
628
What were the vibes like?
629
Were people optimistic, pessimistic?
630
Were they focused on new token?
631
Were they focused on venture funding, regulation?
632
Like what was the talk of the ton of the vibes?
633
Honestly, the vibes were good.
634
They were positive.
635
But all of the above was talked about.
636
Regulation was a big topic.
637
I mean, I did a panel.
638
My panel was Andy Bear of Coindesk Indices.
639
He runs product for them.
640
Anthony Scaramucci.
641
So he's one of the guys that launched the soul staking ETF in Canada.
642
So yeah, we had like a pretty damn good crew of different people there talking about things from varying different angles.
643
So yeah, oh, and I forgot Jono Steinberg from, he's the CEO of Wisdom Tree.
644
So that was my panel, but there was plenty of panels on all the things you talked about.
645
And overall, I just thought everyone was optimistic.
646
It didn't feel frothy.
647
So I've been to these things like 2022 or 2021 where things really felt kind of frothy, you know.
648
And this wasn't that.
649
So I guess from that point of view, it's pretty good.
650
Nothing seemed over the top or ridiculous.
651
But yeah, vibes were positive.
652
And to some people, dismay, I will say it felt a little bit more like a Towards the Trad Phi conference.
653
Obviously, I go to those as well.
654
So I've been to the stuff in 2022 where things, the vibes are really high.
655
It feels like a club at times and things like that.
656
This was not that.
657
That was a little more institutionalized.
658
And I think that was the goal of what Coindesk is doing, to try to institutionalize the space, make it more available for institutionals and serious investors.
659
It's a great conference.
660
First one I missed in several years.
661
Well, Miami's next year, so it's a lot easier to get to.
662
And for a lot of people, they got screwed with flights back to the York area, including me.
663
So I know some people got their flights canceled and stuff.
664
So if you're listening, that happened to you.
665
Sorry.
666
That's it for consensus.
667
And I don't really have a ton more to report.
668
Let's move on to, I mean, I think the biggest news going on right now is what's going on with the Stable Coin Bill, the Genius Act.
669
Coming into the last month or two, it's like Dems and Republicans are on the same side here.
670
We need to get some sort of stablecoin.
671
And from what I'm trying to say, what I can see is they're basically worried about KYC.
672
I'm going to shout out Nick Carter here, former guest of the pod and friend of the pod.
673
He basically said, like, from what I'm reading of the Democrats and what they're complaining about, obviously, one, let's talk about the first one.
674
From my point of view, if cash were invented today, it would be illegal because they can't trace it, they can't track it, they don't know who's holding what.
675
And they're kind of like preventing digital cash from being able to occur.
676
That's what they're worried about.
677
From my point of view, what the Dems are doing.
678
The second point of view, which I've been saying on this podcast since before Trump even launched his meme coin or right around then, was that we went from over a year, everything was off, and then we swung the pendulum way too far to the right with the Trump family leaning in so hard into the space, which I guess is nice, it's positive.
679
I'm happy they're looking into this.
680
But it's like too much.
681
It's like, even if they're not doing any sort of grifting, the kind of like way that you could see this and people could point to it as grifting and doing things that are not good for the environment and doing whatever.
682
I think all of that, it's obvious the Dems are pointing to that as an excuse for why they don't want to do this.
683
Despite many of them admitting, like, this is a $250 billion-plus industry, and there's no regulation set up specifically for it.
684
And here we are.
685
I rambled there, but like, I just find, I think, like, what I'm happy what the admin is doing with the space for the most part, but like, tone it, I think more people in the space would be happy if they toned it back a little bit with what they're doing with Liberty Financial and the meme coin launches and all these other things.
686
But yeah, you guys are nodding.
687
I don't know.
688
Alex, if you want to go first, I don't know.
689
What are your thoughts on what's going on with the Genius Act?
690
I don't have a strong opinion.
691
And I mean, there is one coin out there that is benefiting from it, but I'm not long enough, so I'm not going to shoot it.
692
I'm sorry, guys.
693
I hope, yeah, let's hope it's passed, but I'm not so confident.
694
There's a very strong, I mean, as we speak, I was just checking a moment ago, as we speak, Elizabeth Warren is on the floor rallying support against it.
695
And her main objections are, as you pointed out, James, that Trump, there's no provision to prevent the Trump family from getting rich on the back of crypto.
696
She's also very upset that there's no block of USDT being traded on U.S.
697
platforms.
698
There's also, and this is actually interesting, specific mentions of the possibility of private companies creating stable coins.
699
And X is specifically mentioned.
700
This is something we're probably going to be hearing more about in the coming months.
701
And then, of course, the usual consumer safeguards.
702
And she's getting support because her points are not invalid.
703
I mean, she actually is making some reasonable points.
704
She is, however, you know, not seeing the bigger picture and she is trying to stop progress in the name of protection.
705
Unfortunately, she just may be successful.
706
And if she's successful, that's really bad news because it will lose the momentum.
707
And if even the low-hanging fruit, if even the easy thing to get through can't get through, then that is going to deflate expectations for further progress in regulation.
708
It's fairly easy to say that it doesn't matter that much because we have a supportive SEC, but the SEC's rulings and attitude towards crypto is dependent on the administration.
709
And what we really need is a bill that changes.
710
Austin is probably one of the foremost experts on this, testified in front of Congress.
711
We've got to get him here soon, by the way.
712
A very thoughtful individual.
713
And his view is: one, it'll get passed.
714
Two, is that the Treasury Secretary or the Treasury should broadly be supportive of this because of what it means for Treasury funding, you know, an extra $250 billion in funding.
715
Now, that's against like a $30 trillion treasury market, but still, it's a source of funding.
716
He made this phenomenal point, though, which I thought was really insightful around China.
717
He said, if you want to weaken China, which is a peer competitor of the United States, he said stablecoins allow you to pay exporters in China in U.S.
718
dollar terms in stablecoin.
719
So it allows those entrepreneurs in China to exit the system.
720
I thought that was very clever because, you know, what we're importing from China is not from the Chinese government.
721
We're not importing bank financial services that are backed by China.
722
They're entrepreneurs with businesses.
723
And yes, some are closer to most state-owned, et cetera.
724
But a lot of this merchandise, you know, that can be moved.
725
And I thought that was a powerful point.
726
This is a no-brainer from a stablecoin national security perspective.
727
Also, limiting payments to actors offshore, like Tether, where you don't have as much oversight and control.
728
So I'd expect that it gets passed.
729
Yeah, that's hope.
730
It's important.
731
Funny enough, to mention the stablecoins in China, the threat of dollar-backed stablecoins being more convenient than other digital payment methods is what is on the surface anyway driving the progress towards the digital Euro, the EU CBDC that we're going to get announced and confirmed towards the end of this year.
732
They are trying to figure out how they can combat the dollar taking over digital payments in Europe.
733
They're forgetting that European digital payments largely run on U.S.
734
platforms anyway, specifically PayPal, Visa, MasterCard.
735
And this completely, anyway, don't get me started on this because it is absolutely insane that they are still insisting that this is what Europeans want when the real story is they're afraid of the dollar influence.
736
Yeah, I mean, I just, the last comment on this I'll make is something that no all kind of hinted at.
737
Like if we can't even get a stablecoin bill, which like before, even before, even before and after Trump's election, it seemed like everyone's like kind of like, yeah, we need to do this.
738
Like it needs to be done.
739
If it's going to take forever for us to get this done, there's just no way a market structure bill is going to get done.
740
Like this, this is a bad inclination for how long it's going to take to get that done.
741
And then you have to wait till after midterms.
742
God help us.
743
I guess.
744
That's my view.
745
So we might be just completely dependent on the CFTC and SEC rulemaking and just what they're going to do.
746
And they're going to have to come up with their own guidelines and we'll go from there, which is not ideal.
747
It'd be much better if Congress would just actually give them some sort of mandate to handle this, in my personal opinion.
748
Let's go on to Coinbase.
749
Coinbase is joining the SP 500.
750
I don't have any strong views here.
751
I'll pass it off to anyone else.
752
If you guys have any strong views, good for them.
753
Ron, what are your thoughts on Coinbase likely joining the SPP?
754
When you had like the Gensler was coming in as the SEC chair a few days after Coinbase had listed.
755
And so now it's a complete circle.
756
It's a big congratulations to Coinbase.
757
I used to work with Coinbase.
758
They were my largest client when I was at Crossriver.
759
So I know they worked hard for this.
760
Kind of amazing.
761
I think the big questions now for Coinbase are: what did they do with USDC and Circle?
762
Do they acquire the business or not?
763
And how do they want to position against Robinhood?
764
They want to go across asset classes or do they prioritize payments?
765
Do they deepen or do they go wider?
766
We have to just see how that next journey unfolds.
767
Another question is: who's next of the crypto companies?
768
To join the SP 500 or to go public?
769
To join the SP 500.
770
I think we're going to see a bunch go public, too.
771
We should get into Circle after this, but I'll let that.
772
Who among them would make it to the SP 500?
773
It's hard.
774
Very, very difficult to get.
775
MicroStrategy is a candidate, I imagine.
776
Strategy would potentially get in.
777
That would be the top.
778
That's when you're supposed to sell, guys, when that happens.
779
I mean, ironically enough, I think to like some of these platforms that have restricted owning of Bitcoin, I've talked to many of the people that are the gatekeepers at these platforms, allowing Bitcoin ETFs or Bitcoin exposure themselves.
780
Vanguard is a very notable one.
781
You can't even use their brokerage to buy the Bitcoin ETFs.
782
And it's funny because like.
783
I feel like it's every day we get a new announcement of some company adding Bitcoin to the balance sheet or some new version of the Bitcoin Treasury company.
784
That feels like a little toppy to me on that front as well, Ron.
785
But I mean, maybe we're just getting started.
786
But like, we're at a point where just your regular equity market exposure is going to have a decent amount of exposure to Bitcoin pricing.
787
Obviously, not too long, large cap just yet, but we're heading there.
788
The big question for Coinbase also will be: they make the bulk of their revenue and earnings through net interest margin through USDC.
789
So, how will that be valued going forward?
790
I think that's a big question to ask.
791
You know, when you join the SP, usually it's like a euphoric moment.
792
And we were, I was very excited about Coinbase.
793
I was writing about as much in 23 and 24 on Twitter.
794
By the way, back then, it was highly shorted and hated by a lot of hedge funds.
795
And there was a big Twitter base that was buying Coinbase.
796
And that's another thing we're seeing in the markets, by the way, of course, where retail investors were faster and outpaced hedge funds.
797
And hedge funds just got squeezed.
798
And the same thing happened with Palantir.
799
It's happening with Coinbase.
800
Happened with Jim Chaino shorting MicroStrategy for three years now, apparently.
801
Did you guys see this over the weekend?
802
He's selling MicroStrategy and buying Bitcoin.
803
And he said, oh, I'm doing what Michael Saylor is doing.
804
I'm selling MicroStrategy shares.
805
I'm buying Bitcoin.
806
Not quite the same, but yeah, I think Coinbase has.
807
I was a big fan of this black the last few years.
808
I don't know.
809
I feel about it now.
810
I was so I'll jump in here real quick.
811
I was a little bit skeptical of Coinbase's stock price a couple of years ago, obviously, blatantly wrong, mostly because I was looking, they're to get so much of their money with net interest margins, which we need to talk about Circle next.
812
But also, their fees are so high.
813
I was actually helping my boss because he's trying to get more and understand how some of this stuff works.
814
And he could not get over the fact that you're paying 1% in fees in some cases.
815
If you do recurring buys, it's over 2%.
816
They are just raking in cash.
817
And that doesn't even include the spreads that they're taking money on.
818
Not that, like, great.
819
Coinbase is a great company, but that has not been democratized.
820
Like, you look in the ETF world, like, you are paying penny-wide spreads, and you are paying zero transaction fees, or at least very minimal transaction fees.
821
And that has not come to the crypto space at all.
822
Even the places that say they have really low fees, not going to send any names, their spreads are pretty high.
823
If you look at what the actual spot price of Bitcoin is and you go to buy them, they say no fee, the price you get executed at is not where the spot price is.
824
I agree.
825
I don't use the ETFs more.
826
Yeah.
827
Because of all the points you raised.
828
Yeah.
829
You know, on Coinbase, if you think about it, Coinbase is a clear example of the story Coinbase tells us is that it's a market that is extremely inefficient and ripe for disruption.
830
Why?
831
Because Coinbase is a horrible product and a horrible platform, run horribly.
832
They have absolutely the worst possible customer service in a scale from one to ten.
833
They rate at.
834
They just had this insane leak where they leaked 1% of everybody's information, got stolen.
835
1% of all active traders, a very large number.
836
They leaked everything, like your address, your name, your phone number, your bank, banking details.
837
Your last digital socials, for those who are not Americans, that number is sacred.
838
They got your trading activity, all your trade, they got everything.
839
And on the news, they dropped 4%, and the day after, it bounced back 8%.
840
So I don't know.
841
And Archmong and Emily and Alicia, they're capable operators.
842
Like what they've accomplished and built is serious.
843
And they've got a lot of community around them, too.
844
I think the question for Coinbase also is like Robinhood.
845
Robin Hood is also founder of LED with Vlad, and their UX is compelling.
846
It's cross-asset class.
847
You don't even need service.
848
The funny thing to Alex's point on Coinbase customer service: once a month I get a customer service call from Coinbase.
849
Immediately, you know it's fraud.
850
You're like, Coinbase is calling me, okay.
851
You know, if I'm driving on the road, I'll try to entertain my kids by seeing how long I can drag out the conversation and protect them from the next unsuspecting person.
852
But yeah, the service is weak.
853
But Robinhood is executing very well.
854
And it's all about the attention of the consumer and where does the consumer live.
855
I think a broader value proposition is compelling.
856
It's Robinhood, who is TradFi, leaning into the DeFi side more so than pretty much any other brokerage-type platform.
857
And we have Coinbase going the opposite way.
858
They've launched a bunch of traditional futures contracts they've done that are CFTC regulated.
859
They're trying to do tokenized stock.
860
It's funny, like we're going to see this merging of different things.
861
And I mean, obviously, that's the area that I'm specifically focused on more so than anything else.
862
Just last quick thought on Robinhood.
863
By the way, Robinhood now, and I owned it a few weeks ago, but I don't know.
864
I mean, nothing is at 46 times forward earnings now.
865
It's above the average analyst price targets.
866
I mean, it's expensive.
867
So this whole, we talked about earlier, this high beta animal spirits, momentum rally, that's happened.
868
That's got to rotate now to other categories.
869
So you're saying I should sell my Robinhood sock?
870
Because I was a big buyer of it the last week.
871
We don't give any financial advice here.
872
By the way, taxes matter and timeframe matters.
873
And I admire the level of execution in the community that they've built.
874
And the product, it's impressive what they've done.
875
Yeah.
876
I also, I want to point out one more thing before we start talking about the Circle deal.
877
You mentioned UX and UI.
878
Alex, you were saying it's a horrible product.
879
Like, I saw a tweet this weekend where the Coinbase traders were celebrating that they ship four-hour candles on Coinbase Advanced.
880
Oh, amazing.
881
And then weekly and monthly are in the works.
882
And if somebody works at Bloomberg, obviously, I have access to some of the best charging in the world.
883
But I'm just like, this is insane.
884
This is a nearly $100 billion company that's celebrating shipping its charging candle with four hours in it.
885
Maybe you guys want to start on the show.
886
I'm technically a customer from back in 2017, and I would use it more if I were allowed to buy more than I'm currently restricted from buying.
887
But there's some things they could definitely do to improve it.
888
Like lower data.
889
They played an important role shaping the industry response to Gary Gensler, though.
890
Yeah.
891
Right.
892
I think the industry owes a big credit to them.
893
And they financed Fair Shake Pack and a bunch of others.
894
And they also rallied the troops in that service.
895
So that, you know, credit owed for that.
896
Yeah.
897
All right, let's get in Circle.
898
We talked about the Ripple bid on the show before.
899
It now seems to be, I don't know if you guys, how true the rumors are on this front, but it seems like, as you mentioned, Ram, like a lot of their money comes from the differential between interest rates and getting free money on their stored in the USDC because they basically have a massive profit sharing agreement with Circle.
900
So I was like, I don't know why Coinbase isn't, if Ripple's offering this much money, I mean, Coinbase, there's so much synergies that are already basically partners.
901
Coinbase makes more money from CDC than Circle almost in some ways.
902
That might be an exaggeration of the numbers, but they're making a lot of money from their Circle partnership.
903
So I don't know.
904
What are your thoughts on Coinbase potentially acquiring Circle here?
905
Coinbase has them by the balls because they have a distribution agreement, right?
906
That agreement has to be renewed at some term.
907
And that's got to be disclosed as a material risk factor.
908
The party that has more value in the relationship is the party that has distribution.
909
That's Coinbase.
910
You can swap out the back end.
911
You can swap out the supplier funding, even.
912
Although USCC has an incredible brand, right?
913
Absolutely.
914
And that's going to start happening.
915
The ability to have a digital dollar that accrues yield that's non-custodial on-chain, that's true innovation.
916
That's innovation that is significant.
917
So, but is the USCC brand enough?
918
I don't think so.
919
I think you're going to see additional stablecoins enter the market with people who can offer distinct value propositions competing on yield, for example, or the issuing bank and the brand and the counterparty risk of the issuing bank, et cetera.
920
I think all those tertiary things you were just mentioning matter, but like you, if you're able to get a 4% yield versus 0% yield, it doesn't matter.
921
I mean, if we're talking 4 versus 4.1, like people aren't going to move, you know.
922
But if you're talking yield versus no yield, particularly in the U.S., like it's going to go to the yield, something like Athena or whatever.
923
I mean, there's plenty of coins out there that are leaning into this space.
924
But again, right now, I think it's more regulatory constraint than any sort of technical constraint.
925
Like there are, there's plenty of yield-bearing stablecoins out there.
926
You just can't do it in the U.S.
927
because one, it'll be considered a security.
928
And two, there is no stablecoin legislation.
929
Noel, you looks like you want to say something.
930
Yeah, go ahead.
931
From what I understand, and obviously I'm not a legal expert and I'm not an American, but yield has various definitions.
932
There are various ways it can be applied.
933
And the Genius Stable Coin Act does prohibit the issuance of yield-bearing stablecoins in that the yield is part of the token or accrued to the token.
934
But there is another way that I've seen some issuers do it, and that is just distribute the returns.
935
That is a different, that's a security, essentially, but it's not, but it is a stable coin that earns a yield, and it's not outside, if I understand correctly, of the scope of the proposed legislation.
936
Correct me if I'm wrong.
937
Yeah, I think you're right.
938
It's outside the scope right now.
939
So, yeah, I don't know.
940
So, the point basically is that yield is not as simple as we think.
941
There are ways around security markets always find ways around any kind of limitation.
942
Where there's money to be made, somebody will figure out how to do it.
943
Exactly.
944
Like nature, it'll find a way.
945
Yeah, it's like water flowing down with gravity.
946
It's going to figure it out.
947
I haven't looked at a deal at all, but it's very hard to replace liquidity.
948
You know, there's a lot of pools and a lot of coins that trade against Circle.
949
That's a hard point to, I mean, Coinbase does not have the entire upper hand, that's what I'm trying to say.
950
That's a great point.
951
Yeah.
952
Also, one thing we haven't yet seen in crypto, because it hasn't been big enough, but at the pace it's going, it could get there fast, is any antitrust move against a crypto company.
953
And while I think Coinbase obviously would be one of interest should they acquire Circle and make USDC the only stable coin they use on the platform, that's just a hypothetical.
954
But it's intriguing that we're getting to the stage when this could be an issue.
955
That would be interesting.
956
And I would echo what Alex just said, because even in the ETF world, we look at things like assets and.
957
Like, it becomes like its own ecosystem, its own solar system.
958
So when something's at the center and there's a lot of things trading around it, it's just being used in multiple different ways.
959
It tends to be used that way.
960
It's part of the reason we have U.S.
961
dollar hegemony because if you're trying to get at different currencies around the world, if everything is trading in dollars, it's much easier to go from the Thai bot into a dollar before you go to like the British Crown is a bad example, but some other currency.
962
So that's part of the reason why there's so much demand for U.S.
963
dollars because everything is traded in dollars.
964
So in the ETF world, which I guess we can get into, I'll give a quick update on ETFs if nobody else has anything to add.
965
Liquidity is really hard to steal.
966
So we see people and ETFs launch and they take over and they'll pass on assets and take more flows from other things.
967
But like SPY, it's not the biggest ETF in the world anymore.
968
But by damn, if something goes wrong in the markets and there needs to be liquidity, SPY is going to be the one that people go to to trade, even if it's more costly and less efficient than newer products.
969
So yeah, great point.
970
Yeah, no, Alex, I think you're on the liquidity pool.
971
That's not easy to display.
972
This merger needs to happen.
973
They'll both benefit from it.
974
One can't live without the other.
975
The impact of economics is too much.
976
Coinbase has an expensive valuation.
977
They should pay with that currency.
978
And then Circle, because it's private, has a funny money valuation.
979
I don't mean that in a negative, disparaging way.
980
It's just you're privately held.
981
It's a funny valuation.
982
It's not until you're publicly traded for a year that you really figure out what you're worth.
983
So they should get this transaction done.
984
It makes a lot of sense.
985
All right, anything else before I give an update on ETFs and what I'm watching?
986
I know most people don't really care.
987
We care.
988
I care.
989
This is my job, but I feel like it's not as critical anymore.
990
I'm not moving the price of Bitcoin with my tweets about ETFs anymore.
991
But yeah, so one of the big things people are asking about, Solana, XRP, ETFs, all of the above, still, everything's just getting delayed.
992
Cans are being kicked down the road for the most part right now.
993
Anything that would hold spot crypto assets that would be new is being kicked down the road.
994
Staking is a huge question right now.
995
I think they're going to figure out a way to get staking done.
996
The problem with staking in an ETF in the U.S.
997
is spot products in the U.S.
998
are in this wrapper called a grantor trust.
999
We don't need to go in the specifics.
1000
It's just a legal structure.
1001
The problem is they technically can't really handle the yield.
1002
It would be what we would refer to as bad income.
1003
So there needs to be some input from the IRS.
1004
I do see income.
1005
Yeah, for lack of a better term.
1006
I'm not a lawyer.
1007
What is that?
1008
It basically does, it's an unqualified income, essentially.
1009
So under the current rules, there's a lot of questions about what staking yield if you're taking in.
1010
So if you're an Ethereum grantor trust ETF and you get Ether back, there are issues with the way that that should or would be taxed because granter trusts are a pass-through entity and you're not just getting cash.
1011
So like there's a whole bunch of these concerns.
1012
So the IRS needs to chime in.
1013
Obviously the SEC and CFDC would likely need to chime in.
1014
So even if the SEC approves this, the question is like, is it going to be settled?
1015
So maybe the SEC, like I have all these thoughts.
1016
It's not really flushed out.
1017
But in my mind, the SEC approves this.
1018
Could they be like, the issuers are like, well, we can't actually do this until the IRS comes in.
1019
And how long does it take the IRS to comment and give feedback?
1020
So that's a huge question mark at this point.
1021
I think the Solana ETS are going to be approved even before staking is approved.
1022
So we could have Solana ETS before we get staking.
1023
The one thing I would point out is the crypto index products that have been filed.
1024
So Grayscale's GDLC, BitWise's BitW, and then also you have Franklin Templeton that has filed for some of this stuff.
1025
And Hashtacks has a product that is out there right now that's just Bitcoin and Ethereum, but will be allowed to hold these other assets as they come due.
1026
The first one due is July 2nd.
1027
So when that happens, I think we'll see some approvals.
1028
And yeah.
1029
So I think it's possible that those things get through because they're less than 10 or 20% of the overall portfolios in these products that are not Bitcoin or Ethereum.
1030
It's possible the SEC comes out with some framework before then and basically uses that early July deadline to approve other crypto assets.
1031
But yeah, so those are my views.
1032
There's a lot of questions still to be answered.
1033
We just saw some delays today.
1034
Things keep just getting kicked down the road.
1035
I don't know if anybody has questions.
1036
It's understandable.
1037
They've got a lot on their plate at the moment and they're still trying to figure out how you know the definitions.
1038
Hester Pierce gave a statement today.
1039
She was speaking at an SEC event.
1040
I haven't had a chance to go through the whole thing yet, but it's characteristically sharp and characteristically supportive.
1041
She pretty much says that she doesn't think most crypto tokens are securities, or that she thinks most crypto tokens are not securities, but the way that they are sold can be an investment contract.
1042
She also highlights how complex.
1043
It's complex, but they're determined.
1044
She does say that crypto is not the most important thing that the SEC is looking at at the moment, but she also highlights how significant and important it is to get this done because the lack of clarity around securities definitions is actually not just unique to the crypto asset class.
1045
They are, the rules are vague, they always have been.
1046
That's partly by design.
1047
But with crypto, it's holding back an entire industry.
1048
Well, it's really funny.
1049
You know, this changing of the guard, and people are coming to a similar conclusion that they won't be heavy-handed and just not helpful, like Gary Gensler.
1050
But they're saying, hey, sometimes security, it depends.
1051
It's complicated.
1052
It reminds me of this.
1053
You guys hear about the news about the Epstein files where Cash Patel, the FBI director, and Don Bongino, now these are like hardcore MAGA Trump fans, they went out and they said, there's really nothing there.
1054
There's nothing there.
1055
It was like the biggest letdown ever.
1056
It's like, but you're supposed to be the other side.
1057
There's supposed to be something there.
1058
Like, no, no, there's nothing there.
1059
It was a suicide.
1060
Sorry, that's it.
1061
But they have a lot to do.
1062
You know, I think the, I hope the SEC learns the right lessons.
1063
Like, why are they not prosecuting Richard Hart for fraud?
1064
Why?
1065
He is a bad guy.
1066
I'm not making a defamatory statement, blah, blah, blah.
1067
That's insane, to be honest.
1068
The fact that they let him just go like that, it's absolutely insane.
1069
Right.
1070
They're learning the wrong lesson.
1071
Like, people in digital assets were happy to see SBF prosecuted for deceiving the public.
1072
They're happy to see Alex Mashinsky sentenced and go to jail.
1073
That creates confidence.
1074
This guy, sorry to interrupt, but this guy advertised very aggressively, literally, a meme coin as a certificate of deposit.
1075
That's the sin that's wrong.
1076
Yes, you cannot advertise banking services unless you are a bank.
1077
That's why Celsius was wrong as well.
1078
Yeah.
1079
So I think this is something that people outside digital assets don't understand.
1080
Like, people in digital assets actually care about law and order.
1081
That's what smart contracts are.
1082
They're immutable forms of governance.
1083
Yeah, I mean, crime is legal now, right?
1084
Isn't that what everyone online is saying?
1085
Within the code?
1086
Yeah.
1087
All right.
1088
We went over as usual.
1089
Anyone else have anything to add before we wrap up?
1090
Alex?
1091
Yeah, just a quick one.
1092
Somebody asked a while ago, you know, what you guys think is best positioning right now.
1093
That's a very loaded question that goes into financial advice because at the same time, it really is dependent on risk aversion and basically prior positioning, et cetera.
1094
There's so many questions to answer that.
1095
But if I, I mean, this is, it's not because it's a crypto podcast.
1096
If I had to pick one asset to deploy right now, it'd be Bitcoin.
1097
Right now.
1098
I don't, my opinion, I wouldn't disagree with Alex.
1099
I think it's a compelling story.
1100
You're going to find out very quickly on Bitcoin, especially just where it is technically right now, which is great.
1101
The second thing I would say is that the miners should be under.
1102
I'm seeing a lot of talk about basically Galaxy going after miners, inefficient miners, to turn them into redeployed towards AI.
1103
I think it's partially representing the price.
1104
It's been doing very well in the Galaxy Stock recently.
1105
The Core Weave follow-through bid, right?
1106
So Core Weave is up 100% since IPO.
1107
Core weave did with Core Weave Scientific, Core Scientific.
1108
To your point, those are the AI plays, these hybrid plays.
1109
And there's a spillover effect from that, I would argue.
1110
Noah, what do you think?
1111
Not something that I follow closely.
1112
Over 10,000 of you this time.
1113
For those of you who are listening to this on the podcast feed or YouTube show later, we also appreciate you as well.
1114
Thanks, Adrian Bears, for this episode of Bits and Bits.
1115
We'll be back in one week.
1116
Actually, we're not recording next week because it's Monday, right?
1117
Oh, yeah, you're right.
1118
So we won't be back in one week.
1119
We'll be back in two weeks.
1120
Thanks, everyone.
