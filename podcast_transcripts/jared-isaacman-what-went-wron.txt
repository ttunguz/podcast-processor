1
Jared Isichman was nominated by President Trump to become the 15th administrator of NASA in December.
2
He passed out of the Senate committee in May and was set to be confirmed by the full Senate this week.
3
However, on Friday, President Trump withdrew his nomination for Isaacman.
4
We asked Jared to sit down with us for a conversation.
5
We dive into everything: his experiences as a successful entrepreneur, fighter jet pilot, commander of the world's first all-civilian spaceflight, and the first civilian to conduct a spacewalk, what he saw in his six months studying NASA, how American government bureaucracy has eroded its performance and puts the nation at risk in the great space race underway with China, and what really happened.
6
Was it a discovery about prior donations to Democratic candidates or an association with Elon Musk that lost him the nomination?
7
Here's my conversation with Jared Isaacman.
8
All right, besties.
9
I think that was another epic of discussion.
10
People love the interviews.
11
I could hear him talk for hours.
12
Absolutely.
13
We crushed your questions a minute.
14
We are giving people ground shoot data to underwrite your honor to me.
15
What are you going to say?
16
That was fun.
17
Jared, welcome.
18
I, many space enthusiasts, was thrilled for your nomination to lead NASA as the 15th administrator of the agency.
19
Founded in 1958, the year after the Russians put Sputnik into orbit, NASA is perhaps, in my opinion, the U.S.
20
government's most pioneering agency, having organized and led our exploration missions to the moon, Mars, the outer solar system, and beyond, as well as the launch of important scientific missions to observe the Earth, to observe our solar system and the deep universe, and of course, the installation and operation of the ISS.
21
And you seemed really qualified for the job as a business manager, a successful entrepreneur, a flight and space enthusiast.
22
So I'm really curious to hear your views on NASA, the space industry overall, the race with China, and frankly, hear a little bit about what the heck just happened with your nomination.
23
A lot of people have a lot of questions that we'd love to hear your point of view on.
24
So I thank you for joining me today, Jared.
25
I'm thrilled to be here to chat.
26
And as someone who's just been a space enthusiast since kindergarten, whether it's through the lens of commercial space or,, the great space race from the 1960s or NASA today, these are all subjects I get pretty charged up about.
27
So love to chat about.
28
What inspired you to get into space?
29
You went to Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and you later became an entrepreneur, but were you always obsessed with space?
30
And did you always dream of doing what you got to do last year, which is walk in space?
31
Yeah, so this is all my parents' fault.
32
They skimped out on a babysitter as a kid and just put me in front of the TV.
33
So I was watching movies Top Gun, The Wright Stuff, Space Camp, the movie,, 1980s movie where if you go to space camp, a robot's going to launch you into space.
34
This was all stuff in my elementary school years.
35
So, I just showed you.
36
I just showed it to my kids last week, by the way.
37
So funny you say that.
38
I pulled up Space Camp.
39
I had to buy it because it's not on any of the streaming services to show it to my kids.
40
Yeah.
41
Okay.
42
I've been to Space Camp to speak to the students a number of times and I ask them, all right, raise your hands if you've seen the movie Space Camp here and know who Jinx is.
43
And no one raises their hands.
44
And that just goes to show I'm old.
45
So, so you were always into it.
46
Is that what you wanted to do to work in aeronautical engineering or as a pilot, or what were you thinking of doing?
47
Yeah,, so it's interesting to start to the story.
48, I started my day job, which is Shift 4,, it's pretty large fintech now when I was 16.
49
And I was just most,, as, entrepreneurs, you're burning yourself out, waking up on the keyboard.
50
And,, I said, I need a hobby in life.
51
So I picked up my passion for flying.
52
And I basically had parallel careers,, in aviation and in business.
53
And I started flying air shows in 2010 and 2011.
54
And I was flying with a bunch of really talented ex-military, even current military pilots.
55
And they were,, you could fly in the,, in the Air National Guard or the reserves.
56
And I found out, well, wow, that's amazing.
57
You can fly fighter jets part-time and serve the country.
58
You need a college degree.
59
I never had one because I started my business at 16.
60
So that's why I went back to school, went to Emory Riddle, because it's an aviation school.
61
I think it graduates more Air Force pilots every year than the Air Force Academy.
62
But anyway, that's ultimately why I got my degree.
63
But my pursuits in parallel of business and aviation has existed really since I was a teenager.
64
So you're running this business.
65
So Shift 4, just for those who are listening, is a payment processing company that is a public company today, $8.5 billion market cap.
66
So you've built an incredible business.
67
And then on the side, my understanding is you've flown 7,000 hours in fighter jets and you've tried to beat the circumnavigation record a couple of times now.
68
So, were you going to work and then on the weekends flying?
69, how did you balance running a company, trying to do that today while balancing this podcast?
70
I can tell you, it's really hard to do that and anything else.
71
It's, how did you do that?
72
Well,,, again, I started my business at 16.
73
I started flying a couple years after that.
74, this is before you have a,, a family and other responsibilities.
75
So,, literally, all I was doing was working and flying, mostly flying at night, which was great.
76, I did that around the world record flight.
77
Didn't get it in 08, broke it, broke that record in 09.
78
We did it to raise funds for Make a Wish Foundation, which was which was cool.
79
And it was a great challenge.
80
And then later on, started flying air shows, which was great.
81
And,, we did a lot to raise money for Make-A-Wish there.
82
And then we took the air show flying, which was just maximum fun, super adrenaline, and was, we're doing loops and rolls to music,, 10 feet off the ground, 18 inches between our wings.
83
We probably should pivot this to something that keeps the fun factor up, but has some commercial intent, also helps the country.
84
So we started a defense company called Drakkin.
85
We wound up assembling the world's largest fleet of fighter jets, jets just this behind me.
86
And we were professional bad guys for the Department of Defense, the Air Force.
87
We would fly as aggressors, just in Top Gun, replicating Russian and Chinese, Iranian tactics.
88
I literally,, I remember at Christmas parties in 2014, 2015, speaking to the workforce.
89
I was, I hope you all know, next to commercial space and what Elon's doing at SpaceX, this is the second coolest company.
90 we get to be professional bad guys all the time.
91
It was awesome.
92
So again, I've had two awesome parallel careers.
93
But hey, running two companies, nothing compared to Elon.
94
I think I can't even, he's got to be up to a half a dozen CEO titles in parallel right now, not to mention trying to save the,, the country and get it back on a good fiscal footing.
95
So it's my my responsibilities are pale in comparison.
96
Well, so when did you first meet Elon and how did you meet him?
97
So it's interesting, and I almost guarantee you wouldn't remember it after, well, first, I think in early 2000.
98
So I started my FinTech in 1999.
99
I think we were on the same old, it was a TV show being interviewed in the early 2000s.
100
And that was probably the first handshake.
101
It was after we set the, we broke the, I'm sorry, we didn't break the record.
102
This was in 2008, the around the world record.
103
We came up short.
104
Peter DiManis, Dr.
105
Dumanus, reached out and asked if I wanted to go to Baikonur and see a Soyuz launch with some of the early commercial space pioneers.
106
I remember,, all the Google founders were on that TU-154,, Russian transport.
107
And I'm, man, if this thing goes down, you're wiping out a lot of brain power here.
108
Because Sergey Larry Eric Schmidt was on it.
109
And it was coming back from that.
110
I think there was a charity poker event or something at Elon's house.
111
It was early days of Tesla.
112
So I think I met him again there.
113
But really, we don't know each other that well.
114
I've only spoken to him a couple dozen times maybe over the years and almost entirely related to my commercial space missions, Inspiration 4 and Polariston.
115
Oh, so you're not super close with him?
116
Because I think there's this narrative that you and Elon have a secret,, deep connection and he's one of your best friends.
117
And,, that's how your hearing went when I look on some of the video clips of how some of the senators were treating you.
118
They're, oh, you're doing this all for Elon.
119
He's your best friend.
120
Yeah,, I think almost every one of the senators on both sides of the aisle made that assumption and asked a lot of questions on that.
121
And I said, look, Elon is one of the most accomplished, if not the most accomplished entrepreneur in modern history.
122
Every one of his companies sets out to solve some of the greatest engineering problems for all humankind.
123
Even his,, super selfless service to the government of trying to getting us back on, again, I said, sound fiscal footing.
124
I admire a lot of what he does.
125
But honestly, and I told the senators, my connection is I paid his company to go to space twice.
126
And look, if there was more than just SpaceX out there offering this service and you had competition, I probably would have paid less.
127
So if anything, I'm very pro-competition in this regard.
128
And I don't consider myself beholden to Elon at all.
129
I want to see all commercial space succeed.
130
I'm a huge space enthusiast.
131
Let's go through that.
132
So you met Elon.
133
Did you get involved as an investor in SpaceX along the way?
134
How did the Inspiration 4 mission come to be?
135
In 2020, I did hear that SpaceX was doing another one of its secondary rounds.
136
And I was connected through, I think it was Citi.
137
And I went up speaking to the CFO at SpaceX.
138
And he's, no, look, the funding round is closed.
139
And we're pretty selective on who we let in.
140
I was, okay, great.
141
Well, hey, back in 2008, I got the first offer to pilot the first Dragon spacecraft, which is wild to think about, 2008.
142
And even if I can't be an investor, at some point or another, I'd love to have an opportunity.
143
And he was, well, can't be an investor now, but we could talk about a human spaceflight mission.
144
And I had no idea I was going to have an opportunity to be the first.
145
I assumed there was a lot of people in front.
146
And man, it was what a privilege to be able to do that, be part of mission design and select a crew of inspiring individuals and raise a quarter of a billion dollars for St.
147
Jude.
148
And it was just a successful mission.
149
It helped open the door for a lot of other commercial missions to come.
150
So awesome experience.
151
So in 2021, you commanded Inspiration 4, which was the first all-civilian spaceflight using the SpaceX Crew Dragon.
152
Yeah.
153
And that was just truly a momentous mission.
154
It was just so beautiful to watch.
155
And I remember it was also a tough year because it was a year after COVID.
156
So it was so great to see that happening.
157
But I had assumed, and I think a lot of people had assumed that you were a big investor in SpaceX or really tight, but it just happened within a one and a half year or year period that you went from, hey, I'd love to put some money into SpaceX to, oh, I can participate and command Inspiration 4 and get out there into space that.
158
Not a year and a half, days.
159 literally from that phone call in October, Inspiration 4 was born a week or two later.
160
We did a ceremonial signing at the Crew-1 launch, which is wild too.
161
And it speaks to the confidence of SpaceX that they were ready to sign up for the first commercial, the first civilian mission to orbit before they even returned operational capability for human spaceflight to NASA.
162
Now, they did demo too, of course, with Bob and Doug, but Crew 1 had not flown when SpaceX said, we're going to get this done.
163
And then 10 months later, we were in orbit.
164
And it was an incredible experience.
165
And obviously, we followed it up with a whole development program with Polaris and flew a second mission as well.
166
Yeah, so just going back, you said you were given an offer to pilot a Crew Dragon in 08.
167
Is that correct?
168
When did that happen?
169
How did that happen?
170
So it was right after I came back from that around the world flight.
171
And again, it said,, Dr.
172
Diamanis reached out and we met in the city, and he was, you seem to be...
173 thinking the way we think in terms of a more exciting future in transportation and aerospace.
174
Now, of course, his interests cover everything from human life extension to he likes to solve a lot of world problems too.
175
And it was through those connections and coming out to Baikonur that I did get that offer.
176
I saw the agreement.
177
It was funny.
178
I showed it to some of the SpaceX folks when we were talking about Inspiration 4.
179
Yeah, amazing.
180
Yeah, just knocked on the door every now and then and got lucky in 2020.
181
It was certainly through the approach of trying to be an investor, but it revisited old conversations and moved very quickly.
182
It's funny that a banker called you from CIDI and that led to you.
183
Oh, you called the banker.
184
I called the banker trying to get a contact, a recent contact.
185
And that's hook me up.
186
I want to get in.
187
That's crazy.
188
Yeah.
189
Okay, so then you said, hey, that was a successful mission.
190
You had obviously a good relationship with SpaceX and the operations team there, I'm assuming.
191
And you said, hey, I'd to come back.
192
And Polaris Dawn was formed at that time, or did that come together later?
193
Just for the audience, so last, was it September, you were the first private citizen in human history to perform a spacewalk, which, again, another incredible moment.
194
And,, I think it was inspiring for people who realized at that moment that perhaps you didn't need to become an astronaut to be able to walk in space.
195, it was really just incredible.
196
But how did the continuation go from Inspiration 4 to Polarison?
197
Yeah, and I'd love to,, Polarison was filled with, we crammed so many really incredible objectives in five days on top of about 40 science experiments.
198
It was an awesome mission.
199
I'd love to tell you about it.
200
But yeah, so when we came back from Inspiration 4, I thought we checked the box on every objective.
201, we navigated the whole,, billionaire in space thing, which at the time with some of the other missions that were going off was attracting a lot of heat and really focused it on trying to do good in the world.
202
That we can make progress in space and try and make the Mother Earth a better place.
203
And we focused on raising a lot of money for St.
204
Jude.
205
And anyway, and we did three days of science and research experiments.
206
I felt really good.
207
And we were a little bit short on our fundraising goal for St.
208
Jude.
209, we set out to raise over $200 million.
210
We wound up raising $250 million, but we were a little short when we came back.
211
And I was, man, we almost got everything done.
212
And then Elon sent a tweet right after Splashdown, 40 minutes after Splashdown, and he said, put me in for $50 million.
213
And he already had put in five.
214
And we exceeded our goal.
215
And I was, man, we got everything done.
216
We set the bar high.
217
Maybe this is it.
218
And it was a couple weeks later that I was invited to go to Starbase.
219
This was the second time I went.
220
This was October of 21.
221
And we sat down with a number of folks, including Elon, and we talked about doing a developmental program where we can build things and test things that hadn't been done in a while.
222
And I remember Elon, he's, we can build a suit, I know exactly how I would do it.
223
And let's go up really high.
224, let's get past the Gemini 11 record, go farther into space than anyone's gone since we last walked on the moon because it's different, it's hard, and we're going to learn a lot.
225
And that's what you need to do when you want to inspire people: is not do the same things over and over again, but do things that are different and build up to an even grander objective.
226
And I was, All right, I'm totally in.
227
And we contemplated other missions,, a follow-on to Plariston and then the first crewed flight of Starship.
228
But the nomination came in, and, I had to put my fun space career on hold for an incredible opportunity to serve the country and contribute to the world's greatest space agency.
229
So, let's get into that.
230
How did the conversation lead to you becoming the nominee to administer NASA?
231
Were you in conversations with Elon first?
232
Is that how this began for you?
233
No, so and I think that's another thing that I'm,, almost every senator wanted to ask:, weren't you Elon's guy in this?
234, I have no doubt.
235, look, he helped the president win the election.
236
He was in Air Force One, Marine One.
237
He was at Mar-a-Lago throughout the campaign.
238
I'm sure he had inputs.
239
I was getting text messages from generals that I got to know when I helped build that defense company, Drakken.
240
That's where we flew all the fighter jets.
241
And they were in now positions of influence and said, Would you to serve in the administration?
242
And it wasn't even just NASA.
243, there were roles from Treasury to the Department,, to the Air Force.
244
And I was, I am honored to contribute anyway.
245, I've had, I've been,, relatively apolitical, but if I've had one political position that I've been pounding the table on since I was exposed to the defense industry at Drakken, it's the competitiveness of the nation.
246
And that's because I saw when we were replicating enemy tactics in 2015 in fighter jets, the gap between our capabilities and the bad guys was wide.
247
And you felt very confident.
248
And every year it started to shrink.
249
And it's, what is going on here?
250
Why are we paralyzed?
251
Why are we slowing down while the Chinese especially are moving wicked fast?
252
And I've spoken out about it from time to time on where I think some of the problems are and over-consolidation in the defense industry.
253
So anyway, I was absolutely honored to have a chance to serve.
254
I'm sure Elon contributed into the,, was supportive in it, but it was a number of folks.
255
And I got a call from Howard Luttnick, who's leading the transition team, and he did a phone interview.
256
And the next thing, 40 hours later, I was at Mar-a-Lago.
257
He said, hop on a plane, come out here.
258
Having a lot of friends of mine who are serving in this administration, your story sounds familiar that folks that are close to this whole group that was sitting at Mar-a-Lago for several weeks and months after the election, I've heard a lot of similar stories that folks got called saying, hey, would you to consider something?
259
And it was very open-ended.
260
It's, we've gotten to know you, we trust you, you're reliable.
261
But most importantly, we're looking for folks that have experience and acumen in operating a business, in understanding how to manage at scale, and really have a similar belief system, I would say, to the folks that were stepping in to run this administration.
262
So I do think what you're saying sounds what I've heard and makes a lot of sense to me.
263
So you then fly off to Mar-a-Lago.
264
What was that?
265
Oh, man, that was so cool.
266, it just happened so suddenly.
267
And I,, just,, put together a quick plan.
268
At that point, I knew it was consideration for NASA administrator, but I'll tell you, in the days leading up to it, I was hearing everything from being at the Treasury Department in various roles and to,, again, to the Department of the Air Force.
269
But I knew it was NASA, and I was, well, I got to come with a plan.
270
And I,, we put together a one-pager for the president.
271
And it was a great interview.
272, I never really met him in person.
273
I shook his hand once in passing 10 plus years earlier.
274
And the president was incredibly knowledgeable.
275
I was impressed.
276
He knew a lot about the space program, which makes sense.
277, he helped with commercial crew return operational capability to the U.S.
278
with Dragon, a big push on the Artemis program, created the Space Force.
279
He knew a lot.
280
He knew a lot about China.
281
We talked a lot about their Air Force,, which I thought was interesting.
282
Some of my defense experience.
283
And it was incredible.
284, it was an hour plus long, and I came away with it feeling really good about the opportunity.
285
Who coached you on your one-pager and what did it say?
286
Nobody coached me on it.
287
It was just, I generally, I've had an opportunity to obviously interact with NASA over the last,, my commercial space career now goes on, well, it'll be five years in a couple months from when it began.
288
And,, during Polaris Dawn, when we were doing suit development, spent a lot of time at NASA using their chambers and facilities, had a lot of,, first-hand experience, certainly Kennedy Space Center.
289
So I had a good starting place.
290
And I think it really just centered on: look, in this environment, budgets aren't getting bigger.
291
We do have to do more with less.
292
The agency is doing a lot of littles, a lot of things that other agencies, departments, companies are capable of doing.
293
That's not why the taxpayers fund NASA.
294, NASA's funded to do the near impossible that no one else can do.
295
Not things that,, companies should be doing for their own competitiveness.
296, NASA helps fund engine efficiency programs for commercial jet engine providers.
297
It's, don't they need to do that themselves or else they lose to their competitors?
298, why are we funding this?
299
So basically,, an idea to go in, stop a lot of the littles that are not needle movers, that are not why the agency exists, and concentrate on the needle movers.
300
So,, that's leading in the high ground to space.
301
Let's get, let's,, let's complete our lunar obligations because that's a whole nother story with China.
302
At the same time, parallel the capabilities to get to Mars, help commercial industry develop the rapid, reusable, heavy lift capability that allows us to go anywhere, pivot from competing with industry to doing what no company would ever do, which is build nuclear spaceships.
303
There's a lot of advantages to it.
304
Nuclear electric propulsion for sure.
305, we don't have to worry as much about refilling.
306
It's hyper-efficient transport of mass.
307
It opens up beyond Mars.
308
And frankly, look, it takes the pressure off in-situ resource manufacturing.
309
And if you are going to do in situ resource manufacturing, you're going to need nuclear power.
310
And the farther we get away from the sun, the less reliant we are on solar.
311
A lot of reasons why that should not be a small program in the lab right now doing light bulbs, but should be a billion-dollar initiative.
312, figuring out the space economy and increasing the rate of world-changing discovery.
313
Those have been my priorities.
314
It's what I told brief the president.
315
It's what I went through the Senate and the hearing on.
316
It's what we would have tried to concentrate on if I got the job.
317
There's a lot in there we should unpack.
318
I want to just get your perspective on the arc of NASA.
319, NASA is a storied institution, inspirational to many.
320
You and me, the same.
321
I still wear a NASA hat with pride often.
322
But,, the agency, from an outsider's perspective, feels it's become a laggard.
323
It feels it's lost a little bit of its luster.
324
Why is that?
325
Do I have that wrong?
326
And if I don't, what has happened to the administration of the agency over the decades that's led to this moment?
327
Well, I, you, I love NASA, and I was so excited to contribute.
328
I was honored that the president nominated me.
329, you've got the best and brightest that show up to work every day and want to win in the high ground of space.
330
And I would have been thrilled to work alongside him.
331
You're totally right.
332
Everything about it, even just looking at the insignia, how damn inspiring it is.
333
But NASA's got problems.
334
But look, that's not unique to them.
335
It's going to be government-wide.
336
Whatever I tell you that I think is wrong with NASA, I would guarantee it's systemic across every government agency and department.
337
The bureaucracy is super real.
338
No one's going to be surprised about that.
339
You have dozens of layers of leadership.
340
Everybody's got a deputy.
341,, things that,, I know,,, we know in business that certainly Elon knows and instills in his companies across commercial space, ownership.
342 you push ownership down to the lowest levels.
343
You empower the smart people to make good decisions.
344, you give them the tools to make those good decisions.
345
You hold them accountable when you get them wrong.
346
That does not exist inside NASA or the government.
347
There is so many layers of management.
348
Everybody's got a deputy.
349
It's crazy.
350
I would have deleted all that.
351, not that, not that people don't need to go, but they need to,, the amount of deputies, assistants, associate assistant to the deputy, the amount of committees, the meetings with 200 people on them, the review boards, all that needs to go.
352
You need so many more doers.
353
And there's a lot of them there.
354
They're really smart, but you got to push down ownership to the absolute lowest level.
355
So you got this crushing bureaucracy that impedes progress.
356
And then, and here's where Congress plays a role.
357
Every state's got some equity that they care about and they protect hell, and it impedes the big progress.
358, I tell you, I love talking to all the senators, and the Senate was so fair to me.
359
And I know I would have had a lot of great votes.
360
But you talk to some senators and they're,, we have a local rocket club that supports these schools, and NASA contributes it to every year.
361
And I want to make sure that continues.
362
It's, well, why can't you do a car wash for the rocket club?
363, this isn't huge dollars.
364
Why can't the community raise those funds?
365
And then you might say, well, what's wrong with a couple rocket clubs,, to inspire the kids all across the country?
366
Well, one turns to 10, turns to thousands, and it becomes a distraction.
367
Those are parts to delete.
368
Those are resources that are draining away from what every senator should care about, which is how do we get to the moon, get to Mars, and shock the world with,, with world-changing headlines.
369
That's what people are waiting for from NASA,?
370
100%.
371, man, what you're saying resonates with me so much.
372
It's not just NASA, it's across the federal government.
373
I've spent enough time now interacting with folks and meeting with folks and hearing similar stories.
374
It's just the chaos that builds with scale, with age, with bureaucracy, with competing interests that all have to be met.
375
And you end up diluting everything away.
376
It's so frustrating to hear that.
377
I think this does play into why China is really just moving at lightning speed right now.
378
They have this immense second mover advantage that is crushing across all technology.
379, when you had the Manhattan Project, we had the technical know-how, the will, and the resources to get something done.
380
And we set up facilities where we needed them.
381, Oak Ridge and Lawrence Livermore.
382
And,,,, you put the facilities where you need them and the talent where you need them to execute on the mission.
383
And everything builds up logically to it, and you deliver a win.
384
And we did the same thing with the space program,, in the 1960s.
385
Well, now, all of those national labs and all, and really honestly, a lot of the facilities within NASA are doing lots of little things for existence.
386
And some of them are relevant to the mission and some are not.
387
And when you try and do something,, glorious now, you have to try and repurpose those resources that are super entrenched and they don't want to necessarily move.
388
And then, of course, you have Congress that's protecting their programs.
389
China is literally doing what we are doing, what we did,, in the 40s and 60s and saying, we're going to, hey, we're going to go after fusion or we're going to work on new next generation, fifth-gen nuclear reactors.
390
We're going to build sixth-gen fighter jets.
391
And they put the facilities where they belong with the right people and resources.
392
There's no baggage.
393
And they have this incredible second-mover advantage.
394
And they're able to get things done at lightning speeds because they don't have all that drag.
395
And we have a lot of drag.
396
And again, it's not just NASA, it's government-wide.
397
And do you think there's a way to fix it without Congress, or is the only way to fix it without Congress?
398
Meaning, there needs to be no Congress if we have a shot of fixing this, and there needs to be a different governing model.
399, look, I think this is why I absolutely support the president.
400
Despite all,, my single largest political donation ever was to President Trump to support his inauguration.
401
It's why I got charged up with Elon assembling the Doge team.
402
It's we do have to shrink the government.
403
We do have to get rid of all these inefficiencies, the waste, and the distractions from the mission, things that we don't need every taxpayer contributing to.
404
And concentrate those dollars, real dollars, on the things that the taxpayers should be fighting for.
405
And when you do that, what?
406 $20 billion or $25 billion is a lot of money.
407
And I know it's a super tough budget environment right now, and people hate change, but I'm always surprised when a million is not a million anymore and a billion is not a billion because you do an awful, awful lot with that.
408
So if there was ever a time to get this done, it's now with President Trump, when he has the House and the Senate behind him.
409
And I'm not surprised that there is frustration from people that were really passionate and are still passionate when this much time goes by and we're not able to get those things done that we thought we'd be able to.
410
So NASA's budget last year, $25 billion.
411
Break it down for us.
412
How is that money being spent?
413
What are the dimensions upon which you would categorize that budget?
414
And we'll talk about what's going forward.
415
Yeah,, look, I think an incredibly large portion of it is with human spaceflight and specifically the Artemis program and SLS.
416
And it's a lot of billions going to a disposable rocket.
417
It is billions that went,, you're talking so,, I think it's five or six hundred percent overrun to build the mobile launcher two for the next generation SLS.
418
So sorry, just tell us what SLS is for the audience.
419
That's the space launch system, I think, or it's they also call it the Senate launch system, I think.
420
And it's spread across a lot of dollars are spread across some key states.
421
Well, look, just to give you an idea, so SLS is just repurposed shuttle hardware.
422
So, and I don't blame anyone for putting us down this path because at the time you did not have Blue Origin or SpaceX or any of these other commercial companies doing the things they're doing today.
423
But they were, let's take the shuttle program parts and put it into a program called Constellation.
424
And let's take the Constellation parts and put it in a program called SLS.
425
And essentially, again, it's the same shuttle motors.
426
It's the same solid rocket boosters.
427
You're basically taking the tank and putting Orion on top of it.
428
Orion is 20 years old, by the way.
429
It hasn't flown humans yet.
430
And it's incredibly expensive and very disposable, but it creates a lot of jobs in certain states.
431
And it's at some point, and look, there's enough hardware now to fly a couple missions and make sure you beat China back to the moon.
432
But you can't be stuck on this forever.
433
This is literally the equivalency, by the way, of taking P-51 Mustangs from World War II and using them in Desert Storm because we got to keep the plants open.
434
And that obviously makes no logical sense whatsoever.
435
For factories, they're making this stuff that used to make landing ships in World War II, that made Saturn rocket, that pivoted to shuttle to SLS, and now to believe that you can't make another pivot is crazy.
436
And the right thing you should pivot towards, honestly, is nuclear.
437
I wanted to talk about the Trump budget proposal for NASA.
438
So this is the NASA budget over the history of NASA.
439
And the proposed budget would basically create the lowest budget since 1961.
440
So they're proposing to reduce the overall budget from $25 billion a year down to $19 billion a year.
441
Were you part of the conversation on building this budget?
442
And then I'll highlight some of the features of this budget here in a moment.
443
But did you have conversations with the administration as this was being put together and some of these proposals were being considered?
444, how deep have you gone in this?
445
No,, when you're a nominee, you're kept in the dark on a lot of things.
446
You do get briefed on everything that's going on with every center,, every major program, things that senators could ask you about from a one-on-one perspective, but you're not given access to sensitive information.
447
You almost need some deniability when you're talking to senators on that, or else your nominations can get held up really big time.
448
So I wasn't aware.
449
I honestly, I was voted out of committee,, the Commerce Committee by Senator Cruz and 18 other, it was 19 senators in total.
450
And the next day, the skinny budget came out.
451
And if that skinny budget had come out,, again, a day or two earlier, I would never have made it out of committee because obviously, as I think is playing out right now, both sides of the aisle are not happy about the budget.
452
Okay, so in this budget, there's a proposal to cancel SLS and Orion, terminate numerous robotic science missions, including the Mars sample return mission, probes to Venus, and several future space telescopes.
453
And it represents the White House's desire to end the development of a...
454
nuclear thermal rocket engine.
455
I guess having scrutinized this budget, how do you react to what you see being proposed?
456
And does it solve what you've identified as some of the challenges in NASA, or are those more management challenges?
457
Does budget create a constraining force here that fixes some of the issues with respect to focus and concentration of capital into the right projects from your point of view?
458
Yeah, it's an excellent question.
459
So first,, look, the big budget reduction is a great forcing function for change.
460
And I know there's a lot of people that probably don't want to hear that, but it is true.
461
That doesn't mean I would have landed at $19 billion in this whole thing, but I fully support the present with the goal of shrinking the budget and getting back to responsible footing.
462
And I do think billions can go a very long way.
463
So I will just start with that.
464
Everything you just said directionally is in the right direction.
465
We've already got paid for enough SLS hardware that if you were to terminate for convenience now, you got enough to launch two or three of them.
466
It's enough to get you back to the moon.
467
Check that box to make sure that you don't have any economic or scientific or national security reasons to stay on the moon and put your energy much more towards commercial industry.
468
Look, nuclear thermal propulsion, I'm not a fan of.
469
I nuclear electric.
470
Nuclear thermal, to test it, you're spewing radioactive debris here on Earth.
471
It's not going to go over well to anyone.
472
And it doesn't really solve your refueling problem.
473
You still need to top it off with hydrogen in space if you want a reusable space plug.
474
So I don't that either.
475
And it's subscale.
476
It's a program that sits in a lab forever.
477 what you need in nuclear electric, I'm passionate on the subject, is you need us to get back to the good old days.
478 we went from the atomic bomb in 1945 to laying the keel on the Nautilus in 1951.
479
Five, six years.
480
We didn't keep it in the lab forever.
481
We said, what?
482
We're going to do big, bold things.
483
And that's what we need to be doing in space when it comes to nuclear.
484
Look, a lot of the science programs I'm huge fans of, Mars sample return, the best thing to do is when the astronauts get there to bring the samples home.
485
Why would we spend billions to send a robotic mission?
486
We can put that into commercial industry and accelerate their timeline.
487
So I wasn't a fan of a pure robotic mission on that one.
488
And, a lot of the big science programs, I want to see James Webb's and Hubble telescope programs launching annually, if not more.
489
Flagship programs definitionally are billion dollar spends.
490
And if you spend a billion, then you've got to get it right, and that means lots of requirements, and we can't take unnecessary risk, and a billion becomes a three billion program and it's never on time.
491 we should be challenging the best and brightest.
492
Give me 10 100 million dollar missions a year.
493
Let's try that.
494
And let's accept that three fail.
495
And get act.
496, I was going to introduce time to science as a KPI.
497, why do we accept things taking 10 years when they could be a year?
498
Even the decadal process of prioritizing scientific missions over a 10-year span is insane.
499
100%.
500
100%.
501
And I think a lot of people hear budget cuts.
502
And I hear this on the NIH side as well now: that the administration and budget cutting is going to take lives.
503
People are going to lose lives.
504
We're going to lose science.
505
This is an anti-science agenda.
506
But if you can get more efficient with how you deploy capital and how you manage the deployment of that capital and the utilization of that capital, you accelerate science, you accelerate outcomes, and you improve the condition and the prosperity for humanity, for America.
507
And it's completely a misdirected statement when people say that a budget cut is an anti-science movement.
508
It's about finding the right places that you get more outcomes and redeploy in a smarter, more efficient way.
509
It drives me nuts.
510
I just see it all over right now.
511
That's just,, it's just politics.
512
I do think overfunding leads to complacency, leads to bureaucracy, which leads to a slowdown in discovery, a slowdown in invention, a slowdown in progress.
513
Anyway, I'm sorry for my rant.
514
I agree.
515
Look,, as entrepreneurs, we know some of our probably best decision-making is always when we were running low on cash.
516
So,, it drives efficiency, and it is a necessity, mother of all invention there.
517
Yeah, look, I think that's just a product of some of our, and I'm not familiar with any of the NIH, and I'm not pretending to go deep on that at all.
518
Just I do think this is a product of the politics of our time.
519
It's a very divided country.
520, people have to take an opposing view and go to extremes.
521
People will die over this.
522
But the government is terrible capital allocators.
523
Come on, we should all know that.
524
And,, we should, as taxpayers, we should be contributing to the things that no one else is willing to do, where there is no good business use case or economic model.
525, it is in,, if competition is working, they can solve a lot of problems, and we should put our energy to what they won't solve.
526
And look, I think Kratzios, by the way, in science, he's a great leader.
527
I've spoken to him a bunch of times.
528, he's not a quack.
529
He doesn't think wild things that.
530
He wants,, the golden age of science and discovery.
531
Science.
532
Good science.
533
Yeah, absolutely.
534
Well, let's talk about Artemis.
535
I think this is a big piece that the American public doesn't fully grok, that we have this effort.
536
And maybe you can just lay out for us the case for Artemis.
537
Lay out for us the case for Mars.
538
Tell us about the relationship between the two and the timelines.
539
Sure.
540
And why are we doing it?
541
Let's just say, I am in the return to the moon camp.
542
That doesn't mean,,, and I know that,, Elon is very focused on Mars, and he has a lot of great reasons why, including just the survival of our species.
543, in the long term, it is the right move.
544
I remember during my hearing, one senator was really grilling me a lot of, well, really, what's the difference between,, moon and Mars?
545
And,, isn't moon the stepping stone?
546
I'm, well, one's a planet,, and,, it has an atmosphere.
547
And if you looked at the moon, it doesn't look pretty.
548, it's getting beat up all the time.
549
It has no protection from,, for solar radiation.
550
So reality is,, you should go to the moon because for 35 years we said we were going to.
551
And I think that's very important.
552, it's very late in the game to say, well, we did it in the 60s and early 70s.
553, that would have been the fine position to state the entire time that we've done it and we're moving on.
554
But we didn't.
555
For 35 years, we said we're going back and we spent over $100 billion of taxpayer dollars saying we were going to do it.
556
And for us not to be able to do it now and watch China do it, I said, it signals a far greater disease across our government and how our system operates.
557
And I don't think we want that reckoning.
558
So, look, we paid for the hardware anyway.
559
Let's go back, but let's parallel going to Mars.
560
So, that's what Artemis is really about.
561, you can say Artemis is about Mars too, but that's 100 years down the line.
562
And, I said, it's a giant disposable rocket program that repurposes shuttle hardware.
563
It's incredibly expensive.
564
We signed up a lot of international partners to support it because we collecting flags.
565
And it doesn't necessarily always mean that what they're contributing to is in the best interest of the program.
566
Case in point,, we add Gateway.
567
Oh man, this is going down a rabbit hole of a lot of things because of the shortcomings of the vehicle.
568
But it's expensive, it's disposable, it is not the way to do affordable, repeatable, efficient exploration, whether it's the moon, Mars, or anywhere else.
569
So, let's get it done and then focus on the right way to go about doing this so that we're not seeing people walk on the moon every five years or something crazy, that it's happening all the time, which is what we get excited about.
570
What is there to do on the moon?
571
Why should we go back?
572
What is the purpose?
573
I think it's almost if you're going to go and commit yourself, take risks in a conflict,, you want clear objectives.
574
And in my mind, again, aside from the fact that the hardware is already essentially purchased, it's clear objectives.
575
Is there any economic, scientific, or national security reasons to be here?
576
And I don't think we can say that conclusively right now, that there are none.
577
And China is going.
578
And if they were to find something, even a small probability, a 1%, let's just say hypothetically it's Helium-3, and they're going to usher in a new form of power.
579
Think about how many conflicts that we've had over the last century over sources of power, over energy.
580
Do we want to get that one wrong?
581
And are we willing to take a 1% chance and that could shift the balance of power here on Earth?
582
I don't think so.
583
And we said we were going to do it for 35 years, and we spent $100 billion of taxpayer money.
584
And I said, the hardware is there.
585
But I think you do it, you make those determinations.
586
Is there scientific, economic, or national security reason to be here?
587
And if not, you move on.
588
And if companies Blue Origin and SpaceX and even Rocket Lab are successful with their vehicles, you're going to have the optionality to go to the moon.
589
It's not, the Delta B is a negligible difference between whether you're going to the moon or Mars.
590
And we should colonize Mars.
591
We should build a colony on Mars.
592
I think we need to go there.
593
And by going there, it is the first step on a far grander journey.
594
Elon is obviously very passionate about it, Occupy Mars.
595
He knows it's not the perfect destination.
596
There's nothing, you can, it's unlike anything in Earth's history.
597
People say it's analogs to the explorers of the 1400s or putting people in those shipping containers for six months and saying we know how to live on Mars.
598
It's bullshit.
599
You could work your whole life on Mars and you still live in a bubble.
600
So it's not going to be an easy way of life, but it is a step in the right direction.
601 our destiny is out and among the stars.
602 we will inevitably learn something out there that's going to change our thinking and it's going to create a craving for that knowledge and we are going to want to continue to go out and explore and learn even more.
603
Mars is the best stop, first step on that journey.
604
So let's talk about getting there and achieving some of the other missions that we might have as a country, as a species, and the relationship with private industry.
605
Elon believes he can get payload into orbit for $10 per kilogram with the Starship platform, which is call it a roughly 100x reduction in cost.
606
Yeah.
607
Maybe more.
608
Maybe from some, depending on the point at which you're measuring it, maybe a thousand 1,000x reduction in cost.
609
And that unlocks the potential to do these things in an economically viable way, going to the moon, going to Mars.
610
Why shouldn't NASA be more fully embracing of this private industry capability?
611
Is it because it's Elon or is it because it reduces money going to defense contractors?
612
What is the motivation against going all in on this company, SpaceX, or companies it, that have built these competencies that would have been unfathomable just a few decades ago, but are real here today?
613
Oh, this is such a deep conversation.
614
So, look, one thing I'd say is, obviously, I love SpaceX, and they safely put me into space twice when two awesome missions brought me home, and I'm cheering them on.
615
I'm happy with SpaceX is doing.
616
I'm thrilled about the investments that Blue Origin is doing, that Rocket Lab is doing,, Firefly.
617
So it's, look, we have a great industry.
618
So the broader question is just why isn't NASA leaning more into commercial?
619
Well, look, it's NASA's foresight that gave birth to the commercial crew program that enabled even me to go to space.
620
So they are thinking in that direction, but there are politics in play.
621
The nice thing is, is those winds are shifting.
622
Throughout my whole confirmation process, you are educated heavily by some very smart political folks.
623
They sherp you around every senator.
624
And they were, look, a year ago, two years ago, the idea of talking to senators that are in SLS states and convincing them we need to be looking a little bit more to the future with commercial and maybe pivoting to things nuclear propulsion would be a non-starter.
625
And I'll tell you, they were very reasonable.
626
All of them were very reasonable that they know that this rocket built on 60-year-old technology that's $4.5 billion of launch has an expiration date.
627
So I do think that ship is turning.
628
It's just, this isn't this isn't a speedboat.
629
The government,, it's turning it's a giant shipping container.
630
It turns a half a degree a year.
631
And that's not obviously fast enough for a lot of us.
632
But I would say it's moving in that direction.
633
And then NASA also has to repurpose its resources on things that a SpaceX or a Blue Origin won't do.
634
They're not going to put a rock, they're not going to build a nuclear reactor and launch it.
635
You're not going to get the indemnities for that.
636
Even shipping highly enriched uranium is a nightmare.
637
That is what the government should be doing.
638
So NASA should be doing what the commercial industries can't.
639
And that, by the way, takes so much stress off a company SpaceX trying to get to Mars.
640
If you can minimize the number of space-based refueling or the in-situ resource manufacturing, look, even when a starship gets to Mars, you're betting on 100 consecutive miracles happening to mine propellant there and bring it back.
641
NASA should be helping.
642
The government should be helping with that because it creates a lot of other optionality.
643
We can have nuclear battle stars in low Earth orbit as part of Golden Dome.
644
There's a lot of reasons why it's not all SpaceX, all commercial versus NASA.
645
It's both.
646
Totally.
647
So just to compare, last week, Space Epoch, a Chinese rocket company, completed its first sea recovery test.
648
So much we saw a few years ago with SpaceX, they had a vertical launch and they landed back in the ocean, about 125-second flight.
649
The key question a lot of folks are now asking: Has China caught up?
650
Is this a space race?
651
Why does it matter?
652
Because isn't space big enough for everyone?
653, the space is the ultimate high ground, and the high ground has mattered.
654, it's had tactical and strategic significance since the beginning of humankind.
655
It matters.
656
I was grateful to have the opportunity to lead,, the peaceful exploration of space, but it's not all peaceful.
657, we can't be naive to the fact that it has been weaponized.
658
And,, China leading in this domain makes a difference.
659
There are things of scientific and economic and again, national security value out there.
660
And we can't, we have to lead.
661
We can't fall behind.
662
If we fall behind, we may never catch up.
663
So, and I am concerned about that.
664, China moving closer to reusability.
665
They launched the second most orbital rockets every year without reusability.
666, thank goodness for SpaceX, or we definitely be already behind in that regard.
667
So I am concerned about it.
668
It honestly is a race.
669
And, yeah, the domain is vitally important.
670
We can't fall behind.
671
So that gives them the high ground with respect to weapons systems, with respect to observational platforms, sensors, et cetera.
672
Right.
673
Yeah.
674
Okay.
675
So let's talk a little bit about your nomination.
676
You seem, I would give you my vote.
677
You should be the administrator of NASA.
678
It would be amazing.
679
Oh, thanks.
680
You testified in front of the Senate committee on April 9th.
681
I think it was a 19 to 9 vote to move you out of committee.
682
Yes.
683
Then there were reports going into this weekend that you were going to be voted on by the full Senate this week.
684
And the estimates were you were going to get 70 confirmation votes.
685
That was some news report I had read.
686
So it seems you were going to fly right through and administer NASA.
687
So then what happened?
688
So, I got a call Friday of last week that,, the president has decided to go in a different direction.
689
It was a real bummer.
690
And I know a number of parties in government need to be notified of that, which,, I expected to have just a peaceful weekend.
691
And the next thing I knew on Saturday,, there was a lot of activity on the internet.
692
But maybe that's just my perspective because I follow space and such.
693
But it was certainly disappointing.
694
But,, the president needs to have his person that he counts on to fulfill the agenda.
695
And yeah, I.
696
The person that called you, what did they tell you was the reason the president was withdrawing his nomination?
697
Just said the president had decided to go in a different direction.
698
We all served at the pleasure of the president.
699
Now,, I started to get some more details as it went on.
700
I honestly also,, I'm not,, I don't play dumb on this.
701, I had a pretty good idea of,, that,, I don't think that the timing was much of a coincidence that,, there were other changes going on the same day.
702
And,, it was obviously a little bit of a disappointment.
703
So are you referring to Elon?
704
I just,, there was, obviously, there was more than one,, departure that was covered on that day.
705
And it became,, at least from what I've heard, that it was, there was a,, there was, and I'm just,, I read the news same as everybody else, but I,, I had, obviously, was in the, in D.C.
706
for the last six months getting ready that,, there were some people that,, that had some access to grind, I guess.
707
And I was a good, visible target.
708
I know the news talks a lot about that,, Democratic donations is the cause.
709
That was not a new development.
710
You just Google.
711
They're all public.
712
The New York Times published an article saying that President Trump knew about your Democratic donations in the past when you received the nomination.
713
So that was not news, according to the New York Times, that that was well understood and well covered.
714
So put the kibosh on that explanation.
715
So what are the axes to grind or the access to grind with Elon?
716
Are there two factions?
717
Whatever you can provide some color on, I think it would be really helpful to understand because there's a lot of speculation going on right now.
718
And I would say some folks are really disappointed in some of the transitions that are taking place.
719
And some folks are really trying to grok it and understand it.
720
So anything you can do to help folks understand would be,, I think helpful.
721, first, I just, I want to be overwhelmingly clear.
722
I don't fault the president at all.
723
I fully support him.
724, the president of the United States,, the leader of the free world makes a thousand decisions a day with seconds of information.
725
He's got to get a lot more right than wrong.
726
So I don't,,, I don't blame,, an influential advisor coming in and saying, look, here's the facts, and I think we should kill this guy.
727
And the president's got to make a call and move on.
728
I think that's exactly,, how it went.
729
It was not the Senate at all.
730
You don't get floor time, by the way.
731, there's 100 nominees that are waiting for floor time.
732
The only way you get floor time is when a lot of senators,, call Senator Foon and say, this is our guy, and we got to move him along.
733
That's how it's a high, you're going to get a high vote count.
734
So the Senate was very fair, really nice.
735
I enjoyed that experience i i think you you got one person.
736
And I don't know the history on what the trigger was or wasn't but decided to to make a move and again i don't fault the president for it at all but look in in in terms of donations i i've always been somewhat of a moderate i i i am a right-leaning i i i do support the president's agenda that's why i made as big of a donation as i did to his cause let me just ask for clarity yeah sorry go ahead i was just gonna say you when you fill out your questionnaire for the senate committee which is public it asks you to list every donation before you go in front of a single senator before you do a hearing you do these prep sessions at the white house where people pretend to be senators and they prep you on the donation question so that wasn't new news might have been new to the president at that might have refreshed his memory perhaps but that i don't i don't think that was a cause i think the media has got it pretty accurate so was this a shot at elon by someone that is anti-Elon people can draw their their own conclusions but I think the direction that people are going is or thinking on this seems to check out to me and what is the root of that is it vested interest in spending that Elon is advocating gets cut is it diametrically opposed philosophical points of view on the role of government what is the root anti-Elon sentiment that is on the other side of the equation here do you think I think that The people overwhelmingly voted for the president to go in and shrink the government and bring about change and get rid of fraud waste and abuse of which I am a thousand percent behind the president.
737
And I believe that that's what Elon and Doge was working towards.
738
But people also hate change.
739 we all know this and people can be very protective of their empire.
740
And when somebody comes in, Elon's got a playbook and I think he knows how to get things done.
741
And I think in a lot of respects that rub some people or what I think that was one of the had some access to grind.
742
I don't know.
743
And we're just waiting.
744
I don't want to speculate on all this, but.
745
Yeah, no,, I think that you've said enough.
746
And I guess you've seen the tweets from Elon today where he was pretty negative about the House bill that is being labeled the big beautiful bill, making the case that it's going to drive up a government deficit to over $2 trillion, $2.5 trillion a year.
747
It doesn't make deep enough cuts.
748
There's a lot of pork in there, a lot of wasteful spending in there.
749
And then the House Speaker today responded to Elon saying, Hey, we've still got a rescission bill coming.
750
We've still got an appropriation bill coming where we're going to start to fix the budget.
751
But clearly, Elon is now getting vocal about his point of view on this.
752
Have you spoken with him at all about what's going on and government spending and his take on things as he's walked out of the office there?
753
Well,, as, mentioned, that's what I told the Senate too.
754, I've only spoken to Elon,, I don't know, a couple dozen times, most of which related to human spaceflight missions.
755
But when I was talking to him towards the end of last year, it was all on government efficiency-related programs.
756
And I think Elon got a lot of people excited about Doge by making one simple point.
757
The interest rate on the national debt exceeds,, the DOD budget.
758
That's scary, and it's getting worse.
759
And we can't spend our way out of this problem, which we've grown a habit to doing.
760
And I know he's very passionate about it.
761
And he sacrificed a lot along with all the others at Doge to try and bring about some significant spending cuts.
762
And then to see a bill come in, whatever, 1,200 pages or so that adds to the deficit, I think was pretty disheartening.
763
I suspect,, I'm not in this fight.
764
And I think trying to codify a handful of billions in cuts probably is a drop in the bucket.
765
So I can't imagine that's too exciting.
766
Do you think he's going to get more vocal?
767
I wouldn't presume to know what goes on through his mind.
768 I said, I think he spends a lot of time trying to solve a lot of world's problems.
769
And the problem for this country, and I think a lot of people agree with it, is that this national debt is just getting way out of hand.
770, this has been my case for about four years: that if we don't fix this, it eventually becomes an intractable debt spiral.
771
And when that happens, all of the wrangling we're doing over budget, priorities, programs, interests, jobs are no longer possible.
772
It's you're trying to rearrange the deck chairs on the Titanic.
773
You don't get the choice of what programs to fund when there is no funding.
774
And that's the unfortunate iceberg we're running into.
775
Do you think Doge is dead?
776
Any point of view on that?
777, it was interesting.
778, obviously there was the grand exit this past week.
779
And then, I don't know, at least in my Twitter feed, I try and follow a lot of the cabinet secretaries.
780, they were all coming out and saying,, Doge is alive and well embedded inside the A.
781, I think it was more implying that,,, we're going to clean house, we're going to take care of our own house as opposed to letting other people help us do it.
782
Problem is,, we haven't been very successful at that historically.
783
So I suspect going into the midterms, people don't want to,, let the other side be pounding the table on Doge.
784
So I don't know.
785, look, I've been an outsider nominee, so I have no idea how it would play out.
786
But I think that some, I imagine some people in the government want to see it go quiet late in the night.
787
Is there a deep state?
788
And does the deep states,, is it too big to break?
789, I don't know what I would classify a deep state or not.
790, there are, there are, there is an absolutely bloated bureaucracy that hates change, gets very entrenched, that is happy to ride out political appointees.
791, what, you're gone in three, four years or,, or dead before you even arrive.
792
We'll wait you out.
793
So I think there's some of that.
794
And then I think there's some of that with actual politicians and political appointees that advocate hell for the status quo.
795
And some of it might be good intended because they're just afraid of what comes next.
796
And why take a risk when you've got something right now that supposedly works?
797
And I ask, what if that comes at the competitiveness of the nation and our economic security?
798
What if we get it wrong because you weren't willing to take some risk and make changes?
799
So I don't think they're necessarily all evil, by the way.
800
I just think some people get very comfortable in the status quo.
801
Are you going to go back to space?
802
I don't know.
803, this is the first time in 26 years that I've been really out of work.
804
I'm sure I'm definitely going to go back and help Shift 4.
805
I won't ever rob my CEO of his well-deserved title now.
806
I'll probably be an exec chair or something.
807
And I got to work.
808
I got to have a mission.
809
But I'll find something to contribute to.
810
And man, I love flying and I love space.
811
And I the philanthropic efforts we've been doing with St.
812
Jude.
813
So I'll keep busy.
814
Amazing.
815
Well, look, you've been, if nothing, Jared, an inspiration to many.
816
I appreciate your commitment to service, your commitment to charity, your commitment to discovery.
817
And I want to thank you for the time today.
818
It's been really great talking with you.
819
Thank you.
820
Thank you.
821
I appreciate having the opportunity to chat.
