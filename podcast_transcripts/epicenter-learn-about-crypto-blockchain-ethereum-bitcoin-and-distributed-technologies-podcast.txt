1
What's interesting to note is that app chains, at least in the broadest sense of sort of like an app-specific execution environment, are winning.
2
Like in the first cycle, there was sort of Ronin and Flow and Stepin.
3
In this cycle, there was DuIDX, Hyperliquid.
4
It's clear that there's product market fit for large projects doing like app-specific environments.
5
Most of them are going for L2s nowadays rather than L1s, and I think that makes a lot of sense, which is also why Initia design makes so much sense.
6
Allowing teams to build entire Cosmos SDK chains in whatever VM they want as roll-ups on Initia and have instant access to basically everything they need from explorers, liquidity, integrations, rewards, kind of all the participants of a world that's so fragmented in terms of L2s that care about themselves and their growth, users on the L1, stakers.
7
How do we align all these people?
8
And we basically built a very robust economic framework that lets us do that, which is called Initial VIP.
9
Welcome to Epicenter of the Show, which talks about the technologies, projects, and people driving decentralization and the blockchain revolution.
10
I'm Brian Crane, and today I'm speaking with Zon, who's the co-founder of Initia.
11
And we are joined today by two very special guests, guest hosts.
12
So Jose Macedo, who's the co-founder of Delphi, and he runs Delphi Labs part.
13
And then Anil, who is the CEO and founder of Delphi.
14
So Initia is a layer one blockchain that's designed around deploying customized, interconnected or interwoven, as they call it, roll-ups.
15
They've just launched.
16
So really excited to dive into Initia today.
17
So just before we get started, we'd like to share a few words from our sponsors this week.
18

32
Cool.
33
Well, thanks so much for coming on, guys.
34
This is going to be fun.
35
And it's kind of a different format than we usually do, but I think it's.
36
Maybe Zahn, do you want to start?
37
Sure.
38
Howdy, fellas.
39
I'm Zahn.
40
As Brian initially said, I'm one of the co-founders of Initia.
41
We just launched.
42
It was pretty awesome.
43
I think we launched the Initia L1 plus around 10 layer 2s all on different VMs all at the same time.
44
It might be the largest orchestrated multi-chain launch ever, probably.
45
I don't think people usually launch multiple chains at the same time.
46
So this is probably the only one that happened, but also, I guess, the largest.
47
Yeah, I'm sure we'll dive further into it, but pass it over to Enio.
48
Yeah, so I'm one of the co-founders of Delphi.
49
We've been early supporters of Zahn and the Initia team for a while now.
50
So we're super excited about this launch.
51
And yeah, excited to be here to talk about Initia.
52
I'm sure Jose and I will talk about our whole app chain thesis, the failure with it, and then how we kind of ended up, you know, diving down initial rabbit hole.
53
Yeah.
54
I'm Jose.
55
I split my time between Delphi Labs and Delphi Ventures.
56
Adventures actually led this initial investment and known Zun for a few years now.
57
And yeah, hoping Zun can make AppChains finally work and avenge our avenge.
58
I think all of us on this call have been bullish Cosmos, which isn't ideal, hasn't been ideal.
59
So hoping Zahn can run it back and make AppChains finally work.
60
Inshallah, brother.
61
I'm curious, what was your experience building on Terra and how did that led to you starting in Isha?
62
Yeah, so I wasn't just building on Terra.
63
Before that, I worked at Terra as a smart contract dev.
64
It was like my first time getting into smart contracting and building in crypto.
65
Before that, I was just a regular software engineer.
66
I played a lot with Ethereum, but never actually built contracts there.
67
And so Cosmosm and Terra were my first time actually doing that.
68
And it was a lot of fun.
69
I thought it was really interesting.
70
Cosmosmo was cool.
71
I got to learn Rust for the first time.
72
All these new principles when it comes to building smart contracts.
73
And the craziest one is just that stuff doesn't execute automatically.
74
Like something has to poke a smart contract to move.
75
And that was just like a crazy paradigm shift in my mind as opposed to building in Web 2.
76
And so that was a lot of fun.
77
I got to build some really cool applications.
78
And then I left Terraform to build my own project with my current co-founder, Stan.
79
And it was an options project that was basically hooked into Anchor along with we had a lot of the ecosystem teams ready with integrations.
80
And it's really exciting because Terra as a chain was like one of the most vibrant ecosystems out of any blockchain that existed at the time.
81
Obviously, a lot of it was fueled by Anchor, which we know was super.
82
And Terra really was all of Cosmos.
83
And I think it was somewhat propping up the app chain thesis to a big extent because we're like, hey, look, this one app chain really succeeded, but none of the others really also succeeded in their own merits.
84
And so once Terra collapsed, I think that with it, a lot of the app chains and Cosmos just crumbled.
85
And obviously, the project that I was building there didn't make any sense anymore.
86
And so we scrapped that, returned money back to our investors who funded us back then.
87
And then basically a few months later, we're thinking about what to build next because me and Stan still wanted to do something.
88
And we started basically thinking about the NISHA and rebuilding the app chain thesis with a much heavier guiding hand, one where you shape its creation, the first few app chains, and how everything comes to play, rather than leaving it all up to an open source system.
89
Yeah, that was kind of the beginnings of that.
90
And when I was working on Terra is when I first met Jose and Eniil.
91
I think at the time they were on the labs team working on Astroport.
92
That's actually how I met my co-founder, Stan.
93
He was designing, building Uni v3 or concentrated liquidity pools for Astroport.
94
And I was supposed to help build it.
95
So thanks, Jose.
96
You're welcome.
97
So, yeah, let's talk about the AppChain thesis more generally.
98
I mean, I guess if you sort of zoom out, right, then the thing that everyone competes for the most in crypto, I would say, is like application developers, right?
99
And application developers have a lot of different options today.
100
You could build maybe on each mainnet, but you know, fees are high, so that's probably not the preferred choice for most people.
101
But you have things like Solana and base that are at the top, right, where you can just build your smart contract on there.
102
Or you could say you build your own L1, right?
103
So that has maybe struggled a bit, but it's still happening quite a lot, right?
104
People still build their own L1, whether it's like a kind of totally new L1, or whether it's maybe Cosmos chains, or some other people compete, trying to compete here, maybe like Avalanche and some others trying to go in.
105
Or there's roll-ups, right?
106
And then roll-ups, again, there's many options, right?
107
You could deploy on an existing roll-up or do your own roll-up, and you do your own roll-up.
108
You can do it on Ethereum.
109
You could do maybe some sovereign roll-up on Celestia, right?
110
Or you could build on Initia, right?
111
Like Interwoven Rollup.
112
How, maybe for any of you guys, how do you guys see the sort of pros and cons here and the state of the app chain thesis?
113
So yeah, I think that the trade-offs, and I think one thing that's interesting to note is that app chains, at least in the broadest sense of sort of like an app-specific execution environment, are like winning.
114
You know, we've seen it across all cycles, right?
115
Like in the first cycle, there was sort of Ronin and Flow and Stepin.
116
In this cycle, there was DYDX, Hyperliquid, Last, Abstract, Converge now.
117
It's clear that there's a product market fit for large projects doing app-specific environments.
118
Most of them are going for L2s nowadays rather than L1s.
119
And I think that makes a lot of sense, which is also why Initiative Design makes so much sense.
120
And I think the main reason that people do this is because sovereignty and customizability matter, right?
121
Developers want to control the ground they build on.
122
They want to be able to build fully vertically integrated experiences.
123
They don't want to necessarily compete for block space, face uncertain costs.
124
They might want to customize parts of their stack.
125
They might even want to be able to roll back state if they need to, right, without relying on an L1 having to do that, if there's a hack or something like that.
126
So I think there's a lot of reasons for going into an app-specific environment.
127
And I think that thesis is winning.
128
The thing that didn't win was like Cosmos, right?
129
Or I guess Cosmos SDK has done, has done well, has done okay.
130
But Cosmos or like Atom as a token and sort of the tokens in that ecosystem haven't really done well.
131
And to me, Cosmos just sort of misunderstood the role of like the hub that a hub needs to provide to app chains, right?
132
And I think part of it is because it was conceived 10 years ago before anyone who was even talking about L2s.
133
And most of the design decisions were made optimizing for sovereign chains rather than roll-ups.
134
But the second thing, and most important, I think, is that it sort of misunderstood what projects want from their hub, right?
135
From a hub, like the realities of what they want.
136
They thought, oh, what.
137
The hardest things about doing an app chains and the biggest trade-offs in launching one versus launching on an existing chain is simple stuff, like wallet integrations.
138
You have to do your own wallet integrations.
139
You have to do, if you integrate with a centralized exchange, they need to integrate with your chain.
140
It's way, way harder to get that done.
141
Block explorers, like there's no block explorer.
142
Even some of the biggest chains today, I mean, Solana Block Explorer is notoriously crap, right?
143
You don't have canonical bridged assets with liquidity, right?
144
So you won't have stable coins.
145
You're going to have this alphabet soup of stable coins with different prefixes.
146
And then there's the intangibles, which is the business development and ecosystem development, which is actually one of the most important parts.
147
If you're a hype project on Solana, you get a lot of benefit from that.
148
There's a bunch of people that go farm your airdrop.
149
People are active on Solana Foundation, tweets you.
150
People will be active on your Discord just because you have that ecosystem behind you of everyone that owns Seoul and wants your project to succeed because it's good for Seoul.
151
And all of this was missing from Cosmos.
152
There was no unified way to bet on Cosmos.
153
It never happened.
154
And at the same time, every time you launched a new chain, you faced all these issues.
155
And so it was just very costly to build an app chain.
156
And this doesn't even go for the fact of bootstrapping validators, having to pay out inflation, fragmenting UX.
157
And so Initia just sort of, from my perspective, really reinvented rethought from first principles.
158
What do you want from a hub?
159
Assuming we go into this sort of roll-up-centric, app-specific world, what do these roll-ups actually want from a hub?
160
And then they sort of rebuild it from the ground up, thinking about all these things and like solving kind of all the problems.
161
And I really, I've just rambled for a while.
162
So maybe Zond, you want to come in and say how you guys did that?
163
Sure.
164
Yeah, I think Jose is right, right?
165
Like, there totally are two ways that crypto scales, right?
166
We all know it's either the fast chain or the app chains.
167
And everybody's working on the fast chain camp.
168
I don't know what's actually going to win in the long run, but I can put my horse in the race for the app chain thesis because it seems like it's the natural evolution, right?
169
It's an application's final destination, is what we call Initia.
170
And it's because apps will want to capture their value and potentially make customizations that lead them to winning one specific vertical because they've altered something that lets them edge out competition on that sector.
171
And that's the way we've kind of seen things play out over time.
172
You know, you have perptexes on every chain, then one actually takes it seriously, builds their own chain, and they just fucking win.
173
And this is going to happen along other verticals as well.
174
So I think the app chain thesis will play out.
175
Now it's about how do we make this very easy?
176
What do teams need?
177
How do we get more of them to build?
178
And I think Initia is just designed in the right way to provide these teams everything they need.
179
But if you look at some of the other options, they're just still so infeasible.
180
Like building a Cosmos layer one, you get the flexibility, but it's still goddamn hard.
181
Building a roll-up on Ethereum, very easy.
182
You have so many RAS solutions, but you fragment all the infrastructure because these RAS solutions give you like 10 DA options and 15 interop solutions and all these oracles.
183
And you need shared standards across a multi-chain world for UX to properly work.
184
And then you have no customizability.
185
Like OP Stack, Arbitrum Orbit, these things are great, but you can't, like, for example, reorder transactions.
186
You can't use a different type of virtual machine.
187
The choices that do matter for developers day in and day out are things that you can't edit, but you get to change the DA layer.
188
Like, those are not what's actually interesting.
189
So at Initia, we've kind of combined the best models by using some of the hindsight in history that we've been through as builders in Cosmos as well as big users on Ethereum.
190
Allowing teams to build entire Cosmos SDK chains in whatever VM they want as roll-ups on Initia and have instant access to basically everything they need from explorers, liquidity, integrations, rewards, and then ensuring that we have a very tight hand on what the product UX looks like.
191
So what does it actually look and feel like for end users interacting with 15 different roll-ups?
192
And do we control those touch points so that over time we can get to a world where it feels like one and the Initia team can envision that and build that ourselves.
193
And then lastly, like how do we ensure that value is retained and how do we align kind of all the participants of a world that's so fragmented in terms of L2s that care about themselves and their growth, users on the L1, stakers?
194
Like, how do we align all these people?
195
And we basically built a very robust economic framework that lets us do that, which is called Initia VIP.
196
And what that does is it essentially just distributes rewards to users that are using applications, simple as that.
197
And as a layer two, to get more rewards, you have to build use cases for the native Init token and basically care and have a reason to care about it.
198
And that's either you build a demand sink or integrate the native token on your chain, or you try and influence holders on the layer one to vote for you.
199
And so, in this way, we kind of make sure that everybody still cares about init.
200
I like to use an example that Initia is like the federal government and roll-ups are like states within the US, where everyone has their own sovereignty, but they still care about the ultimate growth of the entire country as a whole.
201
And I think having this federated stance will allow us to build this app chain future correctly at first.
202
And then in the future, we can think about how to properly decentralize the control of everything.
203
Yeah.
204
I think, like, one of my favorite things that you guys have focused on your approach is, you know, the target customer in the immediate near term has been like definitely devs, right?
205
Building, especially with the flexibility that you have, you know, supporting EVM, Moo VM, Wasm VM.
206
Devs can, you know, build using Solidity, Move, WebAssembly.
207
But I think what's really cool about it is I think at the end of the day, the end user is going to also reap all these benefits, right?
208
And I'm kind of curious, like, you know, would Lota kind of get more into how the launch went?
209
You guys just launched recently.
210
How did it go?
211
I know you guys launched with, I guess, like 10 minutes.
212
Curious, which ones are you maybe not most excited about, but which ones are you most surprised about coming to market this fast?
213
And which ones do you think are necessary for users who are going to start bridging the initial?
214
Like, how's that experience, and what can they do right now or in the near term?
215
You know, launch is never as smooth as you think it's going to go.
216
Everything always has some problems.
217
But I would say things went relatively smoothly, at least on the L1 side.
218
I think one of the things we've seen in the past is just when an airdrop happens, chains always break because you have like hundreds of thousands of users just trying to spam transactions within the same like two seconds.
219
And so we built a really nice batching system that essentially just batches requests.
220
And then we do one transaction that sends like a hundred people their airdrop at one time instead of each of those being its own transaction.
221
And so that really helped make sure that the launch went smooth.
222
And then in terms of layer twos, you know, we did our best to have all 10 and their front ends live before the public launch.
223
But I think it was actually around all 10 chains were live, but maybe only around five of them had their front ends up.
224
So we're in a good place, and we have, I think, five or six more roll-ups that will go live over the next month.
225
So that's pretty exciting.
226
And there's quite a few things that people have been doing on the chain.
227
The first and foremost is we have this system called Enshrine Liquidity.
228
We use our inflation to basically build a hub of liquidity on the L1 that's accessible, but you also stake that with validators.
229
And so I think there is like a $15 million in it USDC pool on the layer one that has a pretty good APY.
230
Obviously, NFA, don't ape into that pool if you don't want to.
231
So that has been pretty awesome to see just that growing and people actually using the system.
232
And then the first VIP distributions happen within the next three days.
233
I think that is one of the most exciting things to have been watching because there's a gauge vote on the underlying layer one where stakers vote which roll-ups they want to receive rewards through the VIP system and watching that evolve has been really interesting.
234
So right now you basically have people playing some games behind the scenes with these whale stakers to try and incentivize them to vote for their roll-up to allocate them more rewards.
235
And you kind of see a little bit of dominance moving towards like the DeFi applications for these because they obviously are trying to sustain larger amounts of TDL.
236
But what's interesting still is that even if you are not a DeFi application and you still get some of the votes here, that is probably hugely advantageous for you and your users because you're not trying to maintain 20, 40, 50 million TVL in a lending market.
237
You're trying to give a little bit of boost for doing actions in a game.
238
And VIP basically just helps you bootstrap that.
239
I think one of the things about bribing behind the scenes is that it's a little bit sus.
240
If you don't know the right people, it's going to be hard to get the gauge vote up.
241
But that is why I'm excited about platforms like Cabal, which kind of make this transparent.
242
I think you guys are investors in Cabal, but it basically allows anyone to, you know, provide incentives to voters to vote for them inside this gauge vote.
243
And that'll be good once it becomes fully transparent.
244
But the economy has been pretty exciting.
245
I think, like, so one of the ones that I point to is Kamagotch.
246
They're a fully on-chain game, just probably the most cracked game that I've ever seen get built that is all on-chain.
247
And it makes perfect sense for them to be their own roll-up because they capture the value from their sequencer.
248
I think in the past four days alone, the sequencer has minted like $15K worth just off of transaction fees.
249
But like, that's already a very awesome sign, right?
250
There are paths to being profitable as a roll-up because you aren't distributing these fees back to a set of validators.
251
You're just keeping these rewards.
252
And, you know, 15K in four days is like probably enough to sustain your runway for a small team of people.
253
And it only increases as.
254
And then they also held a public sale.
255
Their token is backed by baseline.
256
I think they raised over like two or three million in that public sale all on chain.
257
That's pretty awesome for a young, healthy economy.
258
And then a couple of other cool projects that you might want to look at are Echelon and Inertia.
259
They're basically just lending markets, but Echelon has, I think, maybe like 300 mil TBL across Aptos.
260
And now on Initia, they have an early lending market for Init, USDC, TIA, some of these other assets.
261
Yeah, it's, I mean, what have you guys been seeing?
262
Have you tried any of these roll-ups yet?
263
Not yet.
264
Mainly just liquidity providing on L1.
265
Thank you.
266
Honest work.
267
Yes, sir.
268
I've seen some of these NFTs going crazy, too.
269
Yeah, the Stargaze team, they deployed a roll-up called Intergaze, which is basically just Stargaze, but as a roll-up, which is pretty cool, because they are definitely one of the last remaining builder teams in Cosmos.
270
And they have just been launching a few collections like Tuesies, Raccoons, Annios.
271
Those have been fun.
272
Yeah, I mean, regarding the launch, right, maybe one thing briefly to mention since we have this group together, I mean, we, of course, one, right, we've been working with Initia for a while and now we work also with Delphi, right, to launch the first Delphi validator.
273
So maybe Enil, like what was the thinking for you behind doing a validator?
274
Yeah, to be honest, Brian's been annoying me for a while to do, you know, to have Delphi do its first validator on some chains, right?
275
And to be honest, one thing that we always discussed internally was we wanted to make sure we feel like it's kind of like a big responsibility of us tying our brand or kind of like using our brand to kind of have this vote and confidence.
276
So we honestly didn't really think about it till we really started getting excited about the initial launch.
277
And I think we kind of chatted with Brian and said, hey, is this possible?
278
And didn't even realize how closely you guys were working together.
279
I think it made a lot of sense.
280
I think our team's super excited about that.
281
It's gone really well since we first started.
282
It's like a whole different validator business that we've launched.
283
So maybe we'll do more.
284
But I think for now, we're pretty excited to see how this one goes.
285
And to be honest, I think Delphi as a whole, the way that we kind of have operated and learned in the space is rolling our sleeves up and getting our hands dirty.
286
And I think the validator side of crypto has been some side of business that obviously with people like Brian and our network, we've been able to learn a lot from.
287
But I think actually getting our hands dirty and getting involved helps us just understand it way better.
288
And I think Initial was a chain that we wanted to kind of support and kind of get as close to as possible.
289
Yeah.
290
Let's talk about the whole economic model because that feels like one of the most interesting parts.
291
I mean, I think we, on a high level, right, like proof of stake chains have basically so far used their native inflation to incentivize people to stake and secure the chain, and you know, that makes sense, right?
292
But of course, if you think of like the success of a chain, people just staking and securing it, like it's not enough, right?
293
And especially, you know, liquidity is such a crucial thing.
294
And you know, we've seen BearChain do something very interesting there with proof of liquidity, which is, you know, we will see how it works in the long run, but it's definitely, I mean, for us as a validator that's been, you know, very challenging, but very interesting, right, to really understand how to optimize this and how to generate higher rewards.
295
Now, you guys have done this like enshrined liquidity.
296
How have you thought about designing this?
297
And maybe also in reference to the BearChain model, like where do you want to differ here in terms of how it works?
298
Yeah, I think the justification here is, you know, chains are interesting because of their apps.
299
That's why users come and use them.
300
So what can we do to ensure and help apps win?
301
And what else does an ecosystem need?
302
Where should inflation really be going in a network?
303
And it's not to staking.
304
Why is that?
305
Well, if you're staking inflation and your security budget is the vast majority of your inflation and like one of the highest rewarding things to do, you're directly cannibalizing your own ecosystem.
306
If I'm getting, you know, 10, 20% stake tokens with the L1, which is probably like the most secure and safe thing I can do with my tokens, and a lending 6%, I'm never going to go lend my tokens there because I'm just going to stake them.
307
And so I think using that security budget and inflation in a way that actually adds value is hugely advantageous and probably the way that most new chains are going to move towards in the future.
308
You can get to a level of security that is safe enough by using tokens that would otherwise not be able to be used.
309
So for example, in our case, we allow investors to stake their tokens for around the base inflation rate, which is around 2% to 3% APY, so relatively low.
310
The rewards are locked and vested over the same four-year vesting schedule.
311
So, you know, you're not going to be jeated on.
312
And now we have built up a layer of security and economic stake that is enough that we need.
313
So instead of using 40% of the supply to pay to these stakers, let's use it to do something meaningful.
314
And we basically do two things.
315
One is Inshrine Liquidity, and the other is VIP.
316
So Enshrine Liquidity is built basically just to incentivize the Initia L1 to be a liquidity hub for all of the roll-ups on Initia.
317
You know, these, one of the interesting things about Initia is that no team is building a general purpose layer two.
318
We think that is like a losing fight.
319
Every layer two on Ethereum is a general purpose layer two, and the difference between them is the color of their apps or their branding.
320
Really just not interesting.
321
We want people to build app chains.
322
And because of that, you're probably not building a DEX on your chain, or you're probably not trying to build liquidity on your chain, or you don't want to do that.
323
And so, the initial layer one acts as the base hub of liquidity for everyone.
324
And so, we repurpose a lot of the inflation for 25% of the entire supply for staking basically LP tokens with validators.
325
This allows us to just build a hub of liquidity for major assets.
326
And because of how interwoven roll-ups work, it's all accessible from L2s.
327
So, right now, it's just init USDC.
328
We might add other pairs soon, probably init SUSDE from Athena.
329
And then, if there is enough demand for assets like ETH or BTC, we'll build for that as well using the same inflation.
330
Then, the second part of inflation, another 25% of the supply, is basically to VIP.
331
And this is allocated to users of layer two applications.
332
As mentioned earlier, layer twos get rewards based on how much init they have, plus a gauge vote on the layer one.
333
And then, on each of these layer twos, the teams set metrics on-chain on what users should be doing to receive these rewards.
334
So, if I'm Echelon, for example, I need to lend init and lend USDC.
335
And for that reasons, those on-chain metrics count for my VIP scoring, and I'll get init rewards based on that.
336
And these rewards aren't just distributed upfront, they're vested as escrowed init.
337
And basically, the way to unlock these rewards is by me.
338
So it's essentially a programmatic airdrop system where every two weeks users are being airdropped rewards, and they have to keep using these chains to unlock these rewards.
339
And is this a vested interest program that's happening on the L1 or is happening on the L2s?
340
So it's based on the L2 activity, but you get these rewards on the L1 directly to a user.
341
So, you know, it can't be, the team can't just give it all to themselves and then take some of that.
342
They can set an operator commission just like a validator.
343
Yeah, I think the launch has been pretty cool.
344
You know, we have probably around these 10 roll-ups, around 30 to 40 million TVL, and all of that is natural.
345
I think one of the things I've seen from a lot of chain launches this past cycle is TVL deals before launch, so that right when you launch the chain, you basically have like a few hundred million or even billions of dollars of TVL.
346
But this is an incredible waste of money, almost always.
347
The vast majority of this TVL has no mandate, so it's just sitting on the chain, or it's in a form that is entirely useless, right?
348
Like not to throw Etherfi under the bus, amazing team, we have Wieth on the initial L1, but like a Wieth ETH pair is probably not going to do much for advancing your economy on chain, but maybe a stable pair with a native token or an ETH USDC pair might.
349
And so a lot of the liquidity is basically just a way to show on DeFi Llama that you have larger numbers.
350
And you pay for that in tokens that were usually at some sort of seed valuation rather than the currently trading price.
351
And these tokens are kind of phantom tokens, props to teams like BearChain, which did this at least publicly.
352
So everyone knew how much rewards were being emitted for these pre-TVL farms.
353
But there's other teams that essentially just promise investors lock tokens at a discount to bring TVL on the chain.
354
And these tokens just will suddenly appear in the circulating supply because they actually came from something like the foundation.
355
And I think that's a pretty unhealthy habit that the industry has gotten into.
356
And I'm hoping that we can do things a bit more cleanly going forward with Initia.
357
Yeah, it's a big thing.
358
You guys have done, I think, done things the clean way every turn.
359
Like whether going out to community round of the same or like lower round actually than the last VC round, the way you've launched, the float, being transparent about it and stuff, launching at a lower valuation.
360
I think all these things, you guys have done things the right way.
361
Let's see if it pays off.
362
Hope it pays off.
363
I think like one thing we kind of spoke about this a lot leading up, and when we're advising teams on this, is like there's a reason everyone does things the wrong way, right?
364
Or like the wrong way.
365
Like there are a lot of benefits to launching at a higher valuation with a SCAMI float, like all the stuff that you see.
366
And I hope that, like, I think Initia is probably the highest quality project that's done things the right way.
367
There are a few others, but I'm hoping it can start a trend.
368
Because, yeah, it's cool to see.
369
Yeah, I mean, I think this is definitely sort of ties into, well, there's a little bit of a crisis in the industry, I would say, at this point, right?
370
Where we have all of these new tokens launching and people trying to manipulate the price, the FTV, the TVL, and it works until it doesn't work.
371
And then I think we have seen now that just retail, I think it worked in the past, right?
372
Because, oh, it looks great.
373
And then retail users would buy it and it would kind of sort of sustain.
374
And maybe you could sort of fake it till you make it type thing.
375
But then I think users have woken up to that, right?
376
And they're like, well, these things are like down only.
377
And I'm not going to buy it.
378
Right.
379
And so we see basically almost all the new launches struggling, right?
380
And just going down and not being able to sustain it.
381
And everyone worried about the unlocks that are coming.
382
So I think different ways are needed.
383
So it's very cool that you guys are going that direction.
384
Yeah, I think what matters is just how long do you expect to be working on this project and what is your time horizon?
385
The incentives are just totally not set up for you to be a long-termist in crypto by now.
386
I love my team.
387
I love the people that we're working with.
388
And I hope to be working on this for years to come.
389
And so if you have that mindset, I think starting somewhere reasonable and growing with your ecosystem and with the project only makes sense.
390
But we'll see what happens.
391
Yeah.
392
Yeah.
393
I think like even the most long-term teams and that we work with on the venture side or even the consulting side of Delphi, like, you know, once you have a token live, because of the short attention span that, you know, the community and like a lot of, you know, people just within crypto has, there's just so much pressure.
394
I think like we really love how long-term you and Stan have been thinking about Initia and like, you know, just the amount of time you put into even the launch.
395
Like I'm curious, you know, one year after Mingnat, like what's like a single stat that will tell you Initia is like working or not?
396
Like what like for you guys, like what are you guys thinking about, you know, long term?
397
Obviously not, you know, price or anything like that, but I'm curious what you think about.
398
Yeah, I think number of roll-ups is a great thing.
399
But I think it's very easy to be number of roll-ups doesn't actually matter.
400
What matters is probably more so like...
401
There's a well-known ecosystem with over 100 roll-ups.
402
Yeah.
403
Yeah, exactly.
404
I think all that really matters is a few applications.
405
So rather, it should be metrics like revenue generated by roll-ups, right?
406
Stuff like the fees that are actually generated are these teams making money.
407
That'll really show if this interwoven thesis is working out, where you have all these app chains that users can move between very easily.
408
And then probably TBL is just a standard metric to look at across the roll-ups.
409
But I think the biggest one is really just revenue.
410
One question I have, it feels like Initia and the app chain thesis generally is like a bet on crypto innovation, right?
411
That hasn't happened yet.
412
Because I don't know if you agree with this, but to some extent, like if sort of Anatoly and some of the Solana people are right, that the only use cases are minting and trading tokens, then I think Solana or something like it is probably the right design, right?
413
Like a monolith with shared state, like all the deep applications, shared state and stuff, is probably the right design.
414
So I think to believe in the app chain thesis in Initia, you sort of have to be bullish long-term, like crypto innovation.
415
And I'm curious how you feel about that.
416
And also the other two, like, yeah, how do you guys feel about that?
417
Are you bullish at this point?
418
And what applications, like pockets are you most interested in?
419
And especially for you on Initia, Zon?
420
Yeah, I think you're right.
421
It really just depends on how hard are people going to start tinkering.
422
Are we going to start getting some interesting experiments?
423
I've been thinking about it like when a new PlayStation comes out, you get some of the same games that you had before, but then a few years down the line, like Elden Ring.
424
And so I'm thinking that's, you know, it's a similar bet here with the app chain thesis, right?
425
That now that it's actually easy to do this, teams will spend a bit more time and want to control their stack and will build something super interesting.
426
The problem is what is going to be built.
427
And the spectrum is so huge in the design space.
428
And I think the Initia team itself has a range of ideas that we want to experiment with.
429
But it's hard to say exactly what will be done.
430
And what I think is also interesting is these new virtual machines that are opening up the design space too.
431
Like move has only been around for so long, but it is a phenomenal language to work with.
432
But I think the viewpoint that new virtual machines will unlock net new applications is totally wrong.
433
Because based on examples, we haven't seen any net new applications on Aptus or SUI.
434
We just see the same things written in Move.
435
And I think that's just about expressivity as a developer.
436
And so I am bullish on experimentation, but I totally think that it takes time for those experiments to play out.
437
What about you, you guys?
438
Curious?
439
Yeah, I mean, I do think there's strong evidence that DeFi or financial use cases is is just is the thing that like blockchains are incredibly powerful for.
440
And I think that's also where sort of the blockchain advantage really comes in, right?
441
Because the composability in DeFi is just amazing, right?
442
You can do something and then it leverages this protocol and then use a token in some other protocol and maybe borrow against it and do something again.
443
So I think if you compare the traditional financial system and the on-chain system, then I think that kind of composability and DeFi and innovation there does feel like really the unique superpower.
444
Now, of course, I think what it does open up is now you can maybe financialize and incentivize a much wider range of stuff than you can in the traditional world.
445
You can start having maybe social networks that have some kind of incentive component or games.
446
Now, yeah, I mean, I think social networks to me has been one of the things where, you know, even from the very beginning, I felt like if you look at something like Facebook, right, Facebook managed to get this enormous scale, but the users who, you know, the power users who really helped make it a success, they didn't benefit from the success.
447
So I've always felt that if you could build something like a social network type thing where you have much more of an incentive alignment and the people actually driving it forward can benefit and you have sort of markets that actually work, you know, that could be extremely powerful.
448
I don't think we've seen that yet, right?
449
I mean, you had some brief spikes with like Friends Tech, but like, you know, it didn't really make sense.
450
They weren't well designed.
451
So I think that is one example where, as a category, I feel.
452
Gaming, I don't know as much about, but I could see that also being one.
453
So yeah, what do you think, Anil?
454
Yeah, I think, you know, obviously within Delphi, we talk about this question a lot.
455
And I think like when it comes to app chains, we, you know, to your guys' point, I think we've really seen specifically not just DeFi, but like perp dexes kind of be like the biggest winners in this like app chain basis, whether it's DYDX, Hyperliquid, et cetera.
456
I think more broadly, though, you know, the way that I see crypto, I've said this a bunch, it's just like the humans, like most powerful human coordination tool, right?
457
And I think that actually becomes more and more useful with kind of like all this abundance that's created with things like AI going forward.
458
So yeah, I'm still very bullish on a lot of these use cases that we have been investing over the years, even though, you know, something like gaming, obviously we were big investors and big proponents of like Axie and Illubium and stuff way back in the day.
459
I do think games have like this big potential of being this like, you know, every, I think year in crypto, you always, you know, are hoping for, you know, one, two, or three like big, you know, mainstream applications that kind of like not just, you know, show off the power of this technology, but also onboard a lot of the masses that maybe aren't in crypto yet.
460
And I think games are still like a bet that that team still, it's very hard to make that bet because I think a lot of them won't work out, right?
461
But I think we've invested in a lot of like really strong teams that think about this in like the right way.
462
And, you know, we're obviously hopeful that like one of those works out.
463
I think when it comes to like, you know, DeFi and its place in crypto.
464
I think when I first got into crypto, I was super excited about DeFi for sure, but I still thought that there was this huge potential for a majority of long-tail use cases.
465
And DeFi would not be the biggest portion of this.
466
And I think over time, I've kind of come to realize that DeFi is kind of like the backbone of all these other use cases anyway.
467
And what percent is that?
468
Is that like 50, 60% of what crypto will actually enable?
469
Is it like 80%, 90%?
470
Is a thing I kind of go back and forth on.
471
And I think it's like the question of us doing research, us building, us investing to figure that out.
472
I think the next big boom for applications will be once ZKTLS is like here and ready.
473
That's you can just bring anything from anywhere on chain and create primitives for it.
474
And that just widens the scope of what we can bring on chain by like trillions.
475
Right now, it's actually still pretty hard to bring new assets on chain, whether those are like RWAs that no one cares about, like a wine bottle.
476
But once you have like the ability to bring someone's gaming data on chain or like their scores and stuff or their medical records, these are all things that ZKTLS just like enables a lot quicker.
477
And I think that's when you have the next boom of crypto.
478
And I'm pretty excited for that.
479
So just CKTLS basically means you have some sort of web session and then you can verify the results from that to write it back on chain.
480
So let's say if I don't know, medical website and then you can verify some data that I chose there, leveraging SSL.
481
Right and then and then you can verify it on chain.
482
Yep.
483
So I think like, you know, ideas like medical records on chain have been always one of the things that people have said blockchain is great for.
484
And theoretically, it makes sense.
485
We've just never gotten that, which is kind of crazy.
486
Like no one has done it well.
487
Yeah.
488
And so maybe ZKTLS will make that easier.
489
But, you know, I'm just looking for more fun things to do on chain.
490
And I think, you know, like allowing people to bring their World of Warcraft or their league data on chain and start trading stuff or the ways that we can start to stack financial primitives here.
491
Maybe I'm lending against some of my skins or who knows what can be created.
492
But the design space just becomes so much bigger.
493
My kind of take is that basically crypto is in the trough of disillusionment stage.
494
And like, I don't know, I've been speaking to a lot of teams recently that have sort of like been building for a few years and are now seeing like big upticks.
495
And this is everywhere from like sort of WorldCoin to like stuff in the energy space, like the decentralizing grid stuff that we've talked about for years.
496
Like all these things have been building in the background for like sometimes seven, eight years and are really starting to see like upticks.
497
And I think eventually almost all the things that people imagined in 2017.
498
Kind of like how it happened with the internet, right?
499
Like all the most ridiculous, like laughed-at ideas that people had in the late 90s ended up happening.
500
They just happened like way later.
501
So, yeah, I don't know.
502
I think the same thing is going to probably end up happening in crypto.
503
It's just tough because at the same time, there's a lot of very overvalued vaporware because of just the nature of public market, like giving public market liquidity to early stage things.
504
And so you have these two forces happening at the same time.
505
Yeah.
506
But I'm pretty bullish on a lot of these different applications coming to market.
507
And I do think it's kind of a no-brainer to me that pretty much every asset will end up on chain.
508
Like you're already seeing it.
509
And like stablecoins, anyone who's ever owned a stablecoin for a sufficient amount of time just knows it's like you'd rather have that than a fiat dollar in a bank account.
510
It's just better in every way, right?
511
You don't have like a bunk bank cocking you every time you want to make a transaction or asking you to go into the asking you to go into branch.
512
Like yeah, it's seamless like interoperability with anything you want to do with it.
513
So I just think that's going to be the case for like every asset.
514
And you're seeing it with stocks.
515
I think Superstate just announced today they're like bringing stocks on chain.
516
We know a few people working on that too.
517
Yeah, I'm pretty like yeah, I'm pretty sure on that one.
518
And that's just like the DeFi use case.
519
Like I'm, I sort of think there's no way to put the cat back in the cat back in the bottle.
520
Doesn't sound right.
521
Yeah, I think it's going to happen.
522
I think this goes back to like what we were saying earlier about like patience.
523
Like I think the crypto industry has this kind of like mental illness of just like wanting everything to be done like ASAP and now.
524
And I think like one thing I always think about is taking a step back and thinking about how far we've come even since like when we've got into crypto.
525
I think a lot of like the successes and headlines that you're seeing week by week right now or would be things that like you'd be in disbelief in that we would even have the opportunity to see even like six, seven, eight years ago.
526
So yeah, I think like to your point and to Zahn's point, as you bring all these assets on chain, I think another cool part is like all this experimentation, all these maybe dumb games that people view as like not value productive at all have actually been making the info more robust, have made like a lot of these mechanisms and the design decisions like way clearer.
527
So when these assets do get on chain, we have like, we're not starting from zero and have to go and work through all those things while we bring these assets on chain.
528
So yeah, I mean, I'm super excited about that.
529
I think like, you know, one thing I've learned building Delphi at large is just that like you just got to be patient.
530
This stuff doesn't happen overnight.
531
But if you take a step back, like progress is being made.
532
I wanted to ask about one thing that maybe goes a little bit more technical regarding initial.
533
So if you think of the app chain, I mean, one of the big struggles with, if you look at Cosmos, but if you look at AppChains more generally, has been the fragmentation of user experience and the challenge with liquidity as well, right?
534
So, you'd have basically the nice thing in Solana or Ethereum, right?
535
You have all of this liquidity, everything is there.
536
Now, you have different chains, it gets fragmented out.
537
You know, you guys are addressing that, but like, how exactly are you guys solving that problem?
538
So, assets are all issued on the initial layer one, or the vast majority of them.
539
And then to and from roll-ups, there's essentially two ways to bridge, but to simplify things, let's just say they all use IBC.
540
And so, if you have USDC on one roll-up and you want to send it to another roll-up, those tokens transfer through the layer one.
541
Because IBC has pairwise dependencies, if I went from roll-up A to roll up B directly, I'd get USDC one.
542
And if I went through the layer one, from rollup A to initial layer one to roll up B, I'd get USDC two.
543
And so, what we do is we essentially route all transfers through the initial layer one and access this hub because that's where all the liquidity is.
544
And because of that, you can have fungibility of these assets.
545
Where if I'm sending USDC from one roll-up to another, I'm going to get the same version, and we're not going to get any new token standards.
546
Essentially, that's just the key way that we avoid liquidity fragmentation.
547
Cosmos was created as this kind of a web design, but really it should have been more of a hub-and-spoke.
548
And so, we just said, let's hub and spoke this thing.
549
That was kind of like the original, actually, even design and idea around the Cosmos Hub was that you would have this kind of hub and spoke IBC routing thing.
550
Then I think it was just a sort of to some extent it was a you know failure of execution, right?
551
That that didn't happen.
552
And that you ended up having more of these like pairwise IBC thing and then that you know didn't end up working.
553
Everything was a bit too permissionless.
554
Yeah.
555
You got to start off a little bit permissioned.
556
You know, bring the thing into the world the way you want it to be brought in, grow it a bit, and then you can start to give it the reins.
557
It's like having a child.
558
So it's kind of it's kind of where Ethereum probably is maybe trying to go towards as well, in their very slow, methodical, researchy way.
559
The nice thing is you have everyone using the same standard, right?
560
Whether that's to get into Initia, you use Layer Zero, and then around Initia, you use IBC.
561
All the standards are the same.
562
And that means we're going to have consistency of assets, but we're also going to have consistency when it comes to trust assumptions.
563
So as an asset issuer, if you trust one roll-up, you're going to be able to trust the other roll-up in the same way.
564
You're not going to have to look into the details and see, like, how is this roll-up run?
565
What's its sequencer setup?
566
Do I trust this bridging or not?
567
Because they're all going to be the same.
568
And those are going to be enshrined at the L1 level.
569
And once you have this consistency of shared standards, we can start to build a lot of better UX experiences over all of this.
570
I think the UX that we have right now is not bad, but there's definitely a lot of work to be done.
571
We're currently going to do a full redesign of the Initia.
572
We're going to change a bit of the way that you connect to wallets.
573
It's already nice that you can use EVM wallets on any virtual machine chain.
574
I think that's just the biggest blocker for getting anyone into Cosmos: they have to download a Cosmos wallet.
575
So I'm never going to switch from my Rabbi wallet, and so I need to ensure that would work on Initia as well.
576
And so, slowly we'll make this user experience better.
577
We have the assets all nice and unfragmented, and the economy is just getting started, and I'm excited for where it goes.
578
So, maybe a final topic.
579
With Delphi, you guys are investors in Initia right now.
580
You guys were on the valid initial, you invested in a bunch of initial projects.
581
I think you guys have, you know, you guys have done some research reports on Initia.
582
So, a lot of involvement already.
583
I don't know, is there anything on the lab side you guys are also doing with Initial?
584
Not right now.
585
Probably a bit early for that.
586
We could maybe do something in the future.
587
But, yeah, not right now on the lab side.
588
But, yeah, as you said, pretty active on the ventures and research side.
589
Yeah, so people should definitely check out that research report.
590
I think if people want to go deep on Initia, then that's probably the best place to go.
591
Yeah, I think we'll make it public actually for this pod.
592
So, we'll drop it, drop them in the show notes and everything like that.
593
Cool.
594
So, Zon, maybe to end off, what does the roadmap look like?
595
So, if you think of like the next two years, what are the most important things?
596
I can't tell you the next two years, but I can probably tell you the next six months at least.
597
Okay, let's do the next six months.
598
Next six months is getting more roll-ups that we are already working with live and out to mainnet, adding more assets to InShine Liquidity, revamping the Initia app, bridge, and wallet widget to have a better UX, and then probably tweaking Initia VIP.
599
So, VIP is great in the way it is right now, but it only allocates rewards based on the gauge vote in the balance pool.
600
And I think more interesting ways to allocate these rewards will show up over time.
601
And so, we want to make sure that we're consistently evaluating and adjusting our economic models.
602
I think people usually don't change the parameters of their chain after it's live, but these are totally things that you should tweak.
603
It's basically like changing the Fed rates, whether you want savings or people spending.
604
And so, we're going to continue to adjust these things, and that's probably what the next six months looks like.
605
Awesome.
606
And then, like, what about devs and users?
607
Like, what actions should they be taking?
608
If devs want to build on initial, like, what's the process of that?
609
And then, you know, if users want to get set up and everything like that, what's the process for that?
610
If you are a user looking to get in, go to initia.xyz slash onboarding.
611
There's a whole flow there for connecting your wallet, bridging in funds, seeing what apps you can play with, and just getting in there.
612
If you are a developer, docs.initia.xyz, that's your place.
613
You can hit me up at It's AlwaysZani on Telegram or Twitter.
614
If you have an interesting idea, I always love to chat.
615
Cool.
616
Well, thanks so much, Sean, for coming on.
617
And thanks so much, Anil and Jose, for doing this episode together.
618
It was really fun and I'm super excited how this initial is going to play out and what's the impact going to be for the larger way of how people build in crypto.
619
Definitely.
620
Yeah, I appreciate you guys.
621
It was nice to be on.
622
Yeah.
623
Yeah, thanks very much.
624
Thank you, Amigos.
