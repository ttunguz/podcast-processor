I feel everyone keeps making this comparison to FinTech, but it's more and not even banks, just non-bank financial lending people were and math at this thing.
2 every major private credit fund CEO was at this.
3
And so I feel Circle has a very different audience than Tether, and that audience's net worth is almost disjoint.
4
And the set of people who will use both is almost basically the only time that it's going to overlap is in the curve pool to trade USDC for USBT.
5
Not a dividend.
6
It's Tale of Tufawn.
7
Now, your losses are on someone else's balance sheet.
8
Generally speaking, aircrafts are pointless anyways.
9
I'm in the trading firms who are very involved.
10
But I to eat the ultimate on them.
11
DeFi protocols are the antidote to this problem.
12
Hello, everybody.
13
Welcome to the Chopping Block.
14
Every couple weeks, the four of us get together and give the industry insiders perspective on the crypto topics of the day.
15
Tokyo Conchoz.
16
First, we got Robert, the crypto connoisseur and czar of Superstate.
17
Good morning, everybody.
18
Next, we've got Tarun, the Giga Brain, and Grand Pubah at Gauntlet.
19
Yo.
20
Joining us today, we've got Laura, CEO of the show.
21
Hey, everyone.
22
And I am Ace, the head hype man at Dragonfly.
23
We're early stage investors in crypto, but I want to caveat that nothing we say here is investment advice, legal advice, or even life advice.
24
Please see choppingblock.xyz for more disclosures.
25
So gentlemen, I can say we have fully kicked off stablecoin mania.
26
We just had the Circle IPO, which is probably the blockbuster IPO of this year, and it was absolutely insane.
27
So for those of you who are not watching, Circle has been trying to IPO for years now.
28
They originally tried to go out through a SPAC back in SPAC Mania.
29
Didn't go through.
30
Then they tried to IPO earlier this year.
31
And then,, Tariff Tantrum cut that off.
32
And then finally, one last go of it of trying to IPO.
33
There was also talk that maybe they were going to get acquired instead of getting IPO'd.
34
Didn't happen.
35
And their IPO, absolutely incredible performance.
36
So this has been one of the biggest IPO pops in history, the highest two-day IPO pop since 1980 for any IPO that raised more than $500 million, more than Snowflake, more than Rivian.
37
Their first day close, they were up 180%.
38
Second day close, they were up another 30%.
39
Combined two-day jump was 250% total.
40
They originally, in their IPO, their original IPO, they raised $1.1 billion.
41
If they had priced their IPO at the day two closed and roughly at the current price that it's trading today, they would have raised $4 billion instead.
42
It was underpriced by roughly 4X.
43
Right now, it's trading at a valuation multiple.
44
It's a little bit insane.
45
Currently, 15X revenue of their 2024 revenue, 160 times net income.
46
So if you compare that to Coinbase, Coinbase right now is 25 times earnings.
47
Circle is trading at 160 times earnings.
48
Of course, because an IPO, there's still a lockup.
49
Insiders can't sell until 180 days.
50
But it seems that right now, this is the shot heard around the world, that it is now stablecoin season.
51
I don't think anybody was expecting this.
52
People were talking at the time of, oh, maybe the IPO is not going to have enough interest.
53
Maybe they're going to have to price it down.
54
It priced up and then up and then up.
55
And then it just kept riding on public market euphoria.
56
Robert, I think you were probably the closest to this.
57
What's your take on Circle Mania?
58
First correction, it's not stablecoin season.
59
It's stablecoin summer.
60
You got to get that memoring.
61
Okay.
62
Apologies.
63
But technically, it's not summer yet.
64
It's not.
65
It's June.
66
When is it again?
67
That was announced.
68
That's June.
69
Starts June 21st, technically.
70
Okay, fine.
71
I see what's right the first time.
72
Stablecoin season.
73
The summer bureaucrats are in full season.
74
Yes.
75, this was unbelievable because I think it showed and surprised everybody with just how much enthusiasm there is for new public crypto companies.
76
I don't think Circle thought it was going to be this successful.
77
I don't think any of the bankers thought it was going to be this successful.
78
I don't think the investors thought it was going to be this successful.
79
No one on crypto Twitter thought it was going to be this successful.
80, the real question is, where did all this demand come from?
81
So suddenly, because nobody that I spoke to thought it was going to have this outcome.
82
Everyone was, okay, it's going to go public.
83
It's going to be meandering a little bit.
84
This has blown away everybody.
85
And I think it's reset everybody's expectations for the valuations in public markets for crypto companies.
86
The amount of demand here is just ferocious.
87
And so I think it's going to expedite pretty much everyone else's plans to go public.
88
We're already seeing that with new filings.
89
Oh, yeah, Gemini, right?
90
Exactly.
91, there's companies that have been waiting.
92
And I think seeing the success at Circle, it's going to be empowering for everybody else.
93
We're going to see Gemini.
94
We're going to see All Swords.
95
We're going to see Kraken finally do it.
96
We're going to see.
97
But do you think this is a public market generally or is it specific to stablecoins?
98
Well, I think this is both, right?
99
I think everybody wants to get in on stable coins.
100
Everyone can see the Genius Act and the Stable Act and impending stablecoin legislation.
101
Everyone knows that this is a growth market.
102
Whether or not Circle is the only or the beneficiary of this is for sure to be seen.
103
I think in some ways,, all this legislation could be to their detriment.
104
But stablecoins are a hot topic.
105
And we've had so few true crypto native companies outside of the miners going public in the U.S.
106
that I don't think it's limited to just stablecoins.
107
I think this is the first shot out of the quiver, but I think there's going to be a lot more demand than people expect in general for high-quality companies that are rare that you don't otherwise have access to.
108
No one has had access to a pure play stablecoin before in the public markets.
109
Is it overvalued?
110
Probably, right?
111
Is it overvalued relative to Tether?
112, for sure, right?
113
But there's no other way to bet on this.
114, betting on Ethereum, I don't think that really does it.
115
Betting on Solana, betting on whatever L1.
116
If stablecoins succeed, it's hazy whether or not any particular L1 is going to succeed.
117
And so I think if you're a public market investor, clearly you waped in.
118
Well, so John Ma from Artemis pointed out that if Tether were trading at the same multiple that Circle is trading at, it would be worth about half a trillion dollars.
119
Just for reference, JP Morgan is 700 billion.
120
So that would make it the second most valuable financial company in the world.
121
Well, I think it's more justified for Tether than it is for Circle, simply because Circle's margins are not that good.
122
Circle has an incredibly bloated headcount and they share a tremendous amount of their revenue with Coinbase.
123, the same multiple on Tether is far more justified than it is for Circular in particular.
124
For Circular?
125
For Circular.
126
Yes.
127
The other interesting thing is that, so Tether has announced, so the Stable Act right now, I think it's going to be voted on tomorrow.
128
So probably by the time you hear this, there will already be a vote on the Stable Act or the Stable Act, the Genius Act.
129
We're going to forecast that it passes.
130
Yes.
131
Well, it passed closure 66 to 32.
132
So I think it's likely to end up passing, but still TBD.
133
But right now, it augurs fairly well that there's appetite for this.
134
That being said, Tether has said that if this passes, if the Stable Act passes, or sorry, not the Stable Act, the Genius Act passes, that they will basically pull out of the U.S.
135
market.
136
Because one of the provisions of both the Stable Act and the Genius Act is that you can only have high-quality collateral backing your stablecoin, such as short-term treasuries, which already is basically what Circle and most of the other stablecoin issuers own.
137
Whereas Tether has a bunch of other exotic stuff, right?
138
They have commercial paper.
139
They've got Bitcoin in there.
140
They've got other random loans.
141
So they've got a lot of a hodgepodge of collateral that they would have to totally redo what it's their financial infrastructure in order to be the safe, secure stuff that the U.S.
142
regulation is demanding.
143
But would they, though?
144, because it has to be backed one-to-one.
145
They've been generating now in excess of $10 billion profit, right, cumulatively that has been used to buy all this other stuff.
146
If they wanted to go strictly to one-to-one coverage, I think because of how much profit they've made and how much over-collateralization there could be there, I don't think it would be that hard for them to go to one-to-one backing with stable assets.
147
Maybe not, but they've said that they will exit the U.S.
148
market.
149
Now, maybe they're blustering in order to try to move the regulation.
150
But they've said their focus is on non-U.S.
151
markets.
152
And I can see the rationale of that is that,, hey, this is going to be extremely expensive.
153
It also means that now,, every jot and tittle of everything we've ever done is going to be under a microscope from the Fed.
154
And I don't know,, Tether is a famously insular and mistrustful business.
155
They their business the way that it is.
156
And no surprise,, it prints money.
157
It's an incredible business.
158
And this might be part of the reason why you see such a high premium on Circle is because people realize that, hey, Circle is basically going to have the entire U.S.
159
market to themselves because Tether's not going to enter because they don't want to be under this regulatory regime that's coming forth.
160
So it's going to be Circle versus the banks.
161
And there's been all this reporting now about the banks contemplating a consortium.
162
I think it's JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, and a bunch of other banks have talked about doing a consortium stablecoin among the big U.S.
163
banks.
164
And so it might be that the industry separates into their circle onshore, which is the crypto native techie one.
165
Then there's the banks, which primarily serve institutions, maybe.
166
They're more risk averse.
167
And then there's international, which is maybe predominantly owned by Tether.
168
And then let's say on-chain is mostly USDC just because USDC is historically dominant on-chain.
169
I can see it playing out where there's different domains that are really owned by different parties.
170
But obviously it's way too early to really say.
171
Laura, what's your take on Circle Mania?
172
Yeah, so I have so many things to say.
173
So I agree with Robert that the reason that it's very frothy is both because stablecoins are hot, but also public companies.
174, this whole trend with the crypto treasury companies, in particular Bitcoin Treasury companies, people want access to crypto exposure in tradify markets.
175
So,, Circle fits both buckets.
176
But the thing is,,, all this stuff that we're talking about with Tether, I just had Jeff Park on the show for a two-part interview.
177
And it was so interesting.
178, basically, eventually what you could see is that the stablecoins turn the US dollar into multiple products.
179
And that's that's basically if the U.S.
180
is willing to be more entrepreneurial about the fact that it has this asset that so many other parts of the world want.
181
But, who knows, obviously, TBD on whether the government will get its act together to understand that this is a valuable thing and that they, if they were more entrepreneurial about it, they could use it in that way.
182
But,, one example would be just,,, everybody always talks about how Tether is a good example for Euro dollars.
183, there's so much demand abroad for dollars.
184
And, essentially,, you could imagine that there's different yields based on who it is or which company you're using or who it is that wants to mint the stablecoin.
185
So, anyway, all I'm trying to say is that,, I think people understand that there's a huge amount of space within this whole category for a number of different niches.
186
But something that was so interesting was: so I had two different people on the show talk about Circle.
187
I might have had more, but the two that I remember are Arthur Hayes and then Omar.
188
I'm just blinking on his last name from Dragonfly.
189
What's his last name?
190
Yeah.
191
So both of them,, were negative on the Circle IPO and they were saying, and, this is well before the IPO happened.
192
So it was shortly after the news came out that they were going to do this.
193
But, it's all the things that we all know in crypto that they have huge overhead, that the business is super different from Tether because it's compliant.
194, you even hear things people in the security space complaining about the fact that when there's bad actors using USDC, Circle will not freeze the money because since they are a US company, they can be sued much more easily than Tether.
195
And so anyway, so the point is they just have a lot more, they're much more encumbered.
196
So what was interesting is that was the conventional wisdom in the crypto space.
197
But then I don't know if you saw this tweet by Vicki Fu, who I guess she used to work at Circle.
198
And she wrote, watching Circle's IPO pricing is fascinating from a fintech infrastructure.
199
infrastructure perspective.
200
Having built payments infrastructure at Circle, I can tell you, when you control money issuance, you're not in FinTech anymore.
201
You're in monetary policy.
202
And then so she basically walked through what the numbers were looking and then she made comparisons.
203
She said PayPal 70 billion market cap 1.5 trillion dollars in volume.
204
Visa $500 billion market cap $14 trillion in volume.
205
Circle $6 billion valuation $12 trillion in volume.
206
So it's very close to the Visa volume, but what is that?
207, I don't know, 12 or 13% of the market cap.
208
So anyway, so, and now I don't know what the current market cap is.
209
She wrote this on June 4th.
210
But the point is just she was saying everybody in crypto is downplaying the significance of this.
211
But she said,, the math doesn't work.
212
25 times oversubscribe tells the real story.
213
Underwriters priced for safety, but missed the fundamental shift.
214
She said, Circle controls the digital dollar printing press.
215
So anyway, point is, I honestly, I really know where this is going to go because,, just from everything I understand about Circle, even just the fact that they have to give half of their, is it profit, I think, to Coinbase?
216, Coinbase is making more money from USDC than Circle is.
217
And,, it's all this,, even,, I know for a different conversation, we're going to, a different topic we're going to cover later.
218, Mosey tweeted this little pyramid of,, who has the most power.
219
And it's the, it's the people with the, at the distribution channel, right?
220, the exchanges and stuff.
221
And so, again, it's, it, it is, okay, so I know all these things about Circle and their business.
222
At the same time, I know, yes, okay, stablecoins are going to be a huge,, category.
223
So am I overthinking it?
224
Or,, and then the last bit is just, but the banks, when the banks get in, then it's, again, it's another distribution channel that Circle doesn't have.
225
And yeah, okay, maybe, maybe they're going to,, launch their own bank.
226, I don't know.
227
But still,, don't you feel trying to create their own bank and compete with the likes of a JP Morgan?
228, how's it going to go for them?
229
So I don't know.
230
Anyway, so I don't have conclusive thoughts.
231
I have thoughts in a lot of different directions.
232
And I'm curious to see how pan out.
233
Was I going to be the only non-hater on this, this, about this topic?
234
I'm not a hater.
235
I'm a confused person.
236
Robert and Laura deserves way more hater vibes.
237
No, it's not hating vibes.
238
Maybe not hating.
239
Maybe negative.
240
Negative.
241
I went to the IPO party on Friday.
242
And so I talked to Jeremy and saw the whole thing.
243
And first off, I have never seen that many Tradify people showing up to a crypto event.
244
There were literally three of us who were not in suits.
245
So that was also pretty funny and illuminating.
246
And it was funny,, they rung the closing bell and it was everyone was around in a suit.
247
And all the people who were not in Suits, well, the three of us were just in the back.
248
But I think it was, I don't know.
249
I all I have to say is I've never seen this much interest from traditional finance people that was legitimate.
250
There's usually a lot of bullshit Kfabe stuff where they're, oh, Bitcoin price is up.
251
We're going to pretend we're going to do something with blockchains, in 2017, 2018, Visa and PayPal then.
252
And then they don't do anything or just do enough to have enough lip service so that their investors don't dunk their stock for missing out on the next thing.
253
And this time definitely did not feel that.
254
I feel everyone keeps making this comparison to FinTech, but it's more, and not even banks, just non-bank financial lending people were and mass at this thing.
255 every major private credit fund CEO was at this.
256
And so I feel Circle has a very different audience than Tether, and that audience's net worth is almost disjoint.
257
And the set of people who will use both is almost basically the only time that's going to overlap is in the curve pool to trade USDC.
258 outside of that, I feel they are just going to diverge over time.
259
And I think I could see that being a pretty hard to,, if you look at a lot of the new stablecoins, I do really feel Circle may have paid a lot for a early distribution advantage, but it's clear that none of the new stablecoins have been able to, I'm not talking about Tether, I'm talking about all the competing stablecoins.
260
Have not been able to find even a distribution channel that's one one-thousandth of what about what their Coinbase tool is.
261
And so,, I think there's a lot of stuff you have to think about when I don't think you're right that Circle has a totally disjoint distribution channel.
262
Circle is still making these deals, or even today, they're making these deals where they're giving a huge portion of their earnings of the float that's owned by a wallet or owned by some other platform, which implies that they're still competing.
263, they're obviously trying to gather up a lot of market share and they're trying to become dominant.
264
And they're okay with giving up a lot of their earnings today in order to build this dominant position.
265
But it also means that they don't perceive themselves as a monopoly.
266
They perceive themselves as being in a competitive market where they need to give a lot of incentives.
267
I know, I did not say they perceive themselves as a monopoly.
268
I'm saying that their competitors have generally either had this problem where they've had to pay much more than Circle had to pay to get even one hundredth the distribution, or they've just tried to go down the yield-bearing route, and the U.S.
269
government has slapped them in the face, and that will never really happen.
270
It seems that's not going to happen.
271
So, I think Circle set the floor price to what any distribution deal will look, and it makes it exorbitantly expensive for a newcomer to overcome that because everyone's going to be, give me 75% to 80% of the revenue, right?
272, no one's going to, they're going to be, Circle's paying 50%.
273
You're a small fry, we're going to charge you way more, right?
274
I think that there's this interesting, weird pricing power dynamic from it being so high that it makes it the barrier to entry is hard.
275
And that's why I think you're more likely, ironically, to see banks be successful than I think startup stablecoins.
276
And arguably,, I'm sympathetic from the startup standpoint.
277
I do feel the regulation makes it very hard to be a startup stablecoin in 2020.
278
That's definitely true.
279
But, but what do you, okay?
280
So, so you mentioned, okay, the circle has a dominant market position.
281
I think we all agree with that.
282
What do you think about the pricing, though?
283
Because that's what most of us have been commenting on here.
284 what?
285
Two meme stocks exist that both start with C, Core Weave and Circle, and they both were started around the same time.
286
So that's that's my that's my that's my pointing positive on this if you're calling it a meme stock, isn't that you acknowledging that the price is crazy?
287
I think both Core Weave and Circle are meme stocks in the opposite sense of GameStop.
288
They're meme stocks of something that in 10 years is supposed to be a hundred times as big, right?
289
They're well, that's what the problem is.
290
There's not many proxies to bet on those two separately, so everyone just fundles all their bets into one.
291
That's what I was saying.
292
That's the real story.
293
Yeah, I think that's the real story: is that right now there's only one thing you can buy in public markets that represents a stable coin, and that's Circle.
294
And the reality,, it's if we talk about low float tokens, IPOs are low float.
295
There's not a lot of supply out there for all the people who want to own this narrative.
296
So that's what happens.
297
The narrative just runs.
298
And when there is more supply out there, then maybe there's more that that gets although I will say that can happen.
299
Circle IPO is much higher float than some of these data center companies.
300, the Nebius and Core Weave IPOs aren't exactly, those aren't exactly the thing that you would, I would show a regulator to be, yes, crypto is so much worse with these low float, high FDV.
301
Some of the AI IPOs look bad crypto tokens.
302
But what's interesting,, I think, I think Rob was, Rob from Dragonfly was doing this analysis.
303
That if you take, because,, as Laura, you mentioned, half of Circle's revenue just goes to Coinbase, right?
304
And so what that would imply, if you look at this current valuation, is that there's a circle inside of Coinbase plus the rest of Coinbase's business that produces Coinbase's market cap, which would imply that all of the rest of Coinbase's revenue is trading at a less than a 3x or something that.
305
If markets were efficient, if markets were efficient, which obviously they're not.
306
And obviously,, this is okay.
307
This is an artifact of the fact that Circle has very low low float and so therefore not that much price discovery because there's all this demand for stablecoin.
308
Buying Coinbase doesn't give you enough of that stablecoin exposure, right?
309
And Circle is the pure place stablecoin investment you can make today.
310
But it's an interesting artifact of, hey, if markets were efficient, Coinbase should have repriced way up when everyone realized that, oh, this Circle revenue is worth way more than we thought it was.
311
And the reality is it's not the Circle revenue.
312
It's a Circle brand, right?
313
It's the ticker that's worth so much.
314
So I again hate to keep making this analogy to Core Weave, but if you look at Core Reave versus its customers' ratio of market caps and its customers are all rev share slash build out customers, not so different to this case.
315
So, I think you have to look at the macro market stuff.
316
But also, I do really think the market does is tired of betting on pure ETFs effectively in crypto and micro strategy and treasuries and stuff.
317 you've seen the 10th treasury launches not doing that well, right?
318 in the last few weeks.
319
And I do feel Circle feels a real product to people that they can use on the 10th BTC treasury company, right?
320
Which I think that I think there's some irony to these.
321
I know we're going to talk about this soon.
322
The irony to this BTC treasury thing is there might be a golden goose that they killed by having too many of them trying to catch it at the same time.
323
Well, that's what stacks were.
324
There's a little,, it's almost there's too many of them to all survive concurrently.
325
I'm beyond MicroStrategy.
326
I'm not going to.
327
give them a okay well let's let's switch gears and talk about crypto treasury companies because i think this we've been touching on them a few times in the history of the show but there's i think there's more wood to chop that's worth getting into here so for those of you who are not following The the original crypto treasury company is micro strategy microstrategy now rebranded as strategy is a company that once upon a time was a software company now they're just basically a giant bucket of bitcoin and they issue corporate debt and they buy more bitcoin with it and for some reason it trades above nav nav being the value of all the bitcoin in the bucket right now microstrategy trades at about 1.7x all the bitcoin in the bucket and the big mystery is why is this so and there's a lot of competing explanations about why it is that it trades above that that 1x nav and to be clear at times it's traded below nav when crypto is in a bear market and there's not a lot of demand but right now it's trading sustainably above nav or i should not say sustainably persistently above nav and of course what most people think is that the reason why is that it gives you some leverage exposure and it's likely that they're going to be accumulating more and more bitcoin so there's a way that you can get a levered bet on bitcoin by buying this thing so we've had more entrants we had 21 by jack malars we had trump media go out and play the same playbook buying a bunch of bitcoin you saw the same thing happen with nexon in korea then of course in japan there's meta planet the one in japan meta planet and then we just had the launch of SBET, which is an ethereum version of this that's backed by consensus.
328
SBET is up 10x since they announced that they're moving to this ethereum strategy.
329
Now, critics have started to warn that maybe this is this cycle's GBTC.
330
Maybe this is GBTC very famously known as the Widowmaker trade that led to the collapse of 3AC and implicitly through BlockFi and a bunch of the lending companies in crypto back in 2022.
331
But people are not so confident about when this will happen, how this will happen, or whether it really is the same thing or not.
332
Unlike GBTC, there's not the same obvious mechanism for this leverage playing out in the market because corporate debt operates very differently from hedge funds,, taking on leverage and making these trades.
333
There was a story that was put out by Unchained talking about the compensation structure for a lot of these crypto treasury companies.
334
Laura, do you want to summarize that really briefly?
335
Yeah, so basically, there's different ways to think about how you would value a company this and therefore how you would reward the executives.
336
And,, I think traditionally stock price is the metric, right?
337
But in this case, I think at least some of these companies are trying to be a little bit more innovative.
338
So there is one in particular, DeFi DevCorp, which is one of the ones that is accumulating Solana.
339
And essentially, they are tying the compensation for the CEO, CFO, and CIO to the ratio of Solana, to the ratio of Solana in comparison to the amount of shares in circulation.
340
So it's Solana per share is how you would think about it.
341
And yeah, we don't know yet how 21 or Nakamoto, which are some of the bigger name new treasury companies, will be compensating their executives.
342
But basically, it's just an interesting way to look at it because right now, if you look at these valuations, a lot of them are,, the they're just trading at so many multiples compared to the actual underlying assets.
343
So it's just, yeah, what is how,, is that, is it literally just stock price,, especially if, as we all know, right now, because we're spelling out why stock price is a bad idea, which is because of the fact that these things are so tied to the underlying and the underlying is very volatile.
344
So if you just try to stock price and Solana rips, these executives are going to make a bunch of money.
345
But that doesn't really make sense because they didn't do anything.
346, even if, even if they fail to accumulate a lot of soul and do the financial engineering stuff of,, if they don't do that successfully, but soul goes up, stock price would go up and they would make money.
347
And it's, well, what's,, we know it's a bunch of soul in a bucket.
348
Your job is not to have soul go up.
349
You can't make soul go up, but you can put more soul in the bucket.
350
And that's effectively what this financial metric seems to be measuring: is how effectively are you putting more soul in the bucket?
351
Or how effectively are you levering up?
352
Because really what it's incentivizing at a fundamental level is doing the crypto treasury company's strategy, trade, whatever, which is issue a lot of debt to buy the asset.
353, a company that's 1x levered doesn't have as much crypto per share.
354
If you load it up with debt, 5x,, the original amount and by 5x the amount of assets, right?
355
The company's crazy risky relative to its original equity, so to speak.
356
But you've achieved the metric that you're being paid on or optimized for, which is amount of crypto in the thing per share.
357
And so, really, what I think it incentivizes is companies to take on more leverage.
358
And if you squint,, the crypto treasury strategy looks a levered ETF.
359
It's way more exotic than that for so many different reasons.
360
And you cannot model it as such, a levered ETF.
361
But if you squint and look at it from 90,000 feet, it's a levered ETF.
362
And really, I think the trend that we're going to see is companies trying to lever this play up as much as they possibly can, issuing as much debt as they can to buy as much of the assets as they can.
363
Saylor is very public about that.
364
Is the goal to load as much Bitcoin in and borrow as much as humanly possible to achieve that, with the end goal being accumulate all the possible Bitcoin because it's a competition.
365
It's a race.
366
There's only so much.
367
It's scarce.
368
Right.
369
Well, the difficulty is the way in which you lever up, right?
370
Because there are bad ways to lever up and there are better ways to lever up.
371
MicroStrategy lever up the bad way and now it's almost the good way, which is it's an amazing way.
372, it's an absolutely incredible way that they lever up now.
373
You were showing me some of the new offering that they recently put out in MicroStrategy, which is the stupidest financial instrument I have ever seen where they strike.
374
Strikes.
375
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
376
I think there's strikes is what they're called, which is it's debt that they don't have to pay.
377
And it doesn't, there's no catch up.
378
So if they miss a debt payment, they don't have to pay it back later.
379
And it's a 10% coupon.
380
And that's it.
381
And it's, yeah, buy my debt and I'll maybe pay you back if I want to.
382
And I'll go buy Bitcoin with it.
383
And I get all the upside and, you're stuck holding debt.
384
So I think there's this interesting theory that I've heard people posit around MicroStrategy, which is, in the same way that the more forks that Bitcoin had in some ways made Bitcoin more valuable because it airdropped their holders to basically sell and buy more Bitcoin.
385
There's a sense in which the forks of MicroStrategy, all these, the second and third-tier Bitcoin treasury companies, if they start failing, people may just crowd back into MicroStrategy and it becomes this shelling point for this treasury thing.
386
This is another reason I don't think that I think we're going to see MicroStrategy crush and continue unless there's some catastrophic Bitcoin collapse in price, which it has shown it has can survive up to some level, not maybe at the size it is now, but these other ones are just competing for scraps.
387
I feel who are the convertible debt traders who want to buy the fifth place Bitcoin treasury companies debt, right?
388 I just don't understand how they get that feedback.
389 MicroStrategy really was immaculate conception.
390
So to Robert's point, they borrowed the dangerous way first to build up this treasury.
391
And then now they have, now because they were successful, they have this very cheap form of convertible debt.
392
But the convertible debt market is not infinitely elastic.
393
There's not infinite number of people who are, I see this yield.
394
I'm going to go on the debt side.
395 most people who want to get into this trade will go buy MicroStrategy equity or go buy treasury company equity because it's easy.
396
To do the debt trade, it involves a lot more work, a lot more sophistication on how you think about your risk.
397
And also just, there's just not that much demand for people to own that spread, right?
398
It's a very precise arbitrage.
399
You need to be in large enough size for it to work out for you transaction cost-wise.
400
And there just aren't that many people.
401
So, I think of it personally as there's a fixed pie of demand.
402
And MicroStrategy probably takes up at least 50% of that, if not more.
403
Right.
404
And that other 50%, everyone is just fighting.
405
And the more there's new companies, they're all fighting for the same set of convertible debt arbitragers.
406
And maybe that set grows, but that set grows 10% a year.
407
That's not growing as much as these companies' demand, if you look at the aggregate demand is.
408
And I think there's going to be some shortfall.
409
I wouldn't be surprised if we see some of these treasury companies completely pivot because they're unable to issue debt and they have to find some alternative.
410
Well, let me say yes, but.
411
Okay, so I think here's the biggest difference to traditional convertible arbitrage and the market for it.
412
So if a normal, normal, not crypto treasury company, let's just say some manufacturing company,, in the heartland that does, I don't know, whatever, makes widgets, wants to issue convertibles, the market for it is looking at really the volatility of that company and the upside in the stock above the conversion price and doing options valuation arbitrage to say how much is the option at that convert worth.
413
And the market for that is really tiny because you're basically betting on this one little widget company and its prospects in essence.
414
And how many people even want that exposure in the first place?
415
Because with convertible, you still have the debt underwriting downside of that widget company combined with an option that you can value.
416
With strategy or with any of these other ones, the company is all my micro strategies.
417
I know you were inceptioning me to get it wrong.
418
So with strategy or any of the crypto treasury companies, it's different than that, right?
419
The downside across all Bitcoin companies is almost more uniform.
420
There's less esoteric, weird company risk that you have to underwrite, right?
421
It has nothing to do with the company itself.
422
The company is a shell.
423
The company is a holding pot or a box,.
424
And so, all of these companies, in a lot of ways, look a little bit more alike.
425
The downside is based on the downside of Bitcoin.
426
That's going to be uniform across every one of these Bitcoin-based strategies.
427
And the upside is more uniform across them as well.
428
It's based on the volatility of Bitcoin once it becomes a pure Bitcoin play.
429
And so, it has nothing to do with the company's esoteric behaviors.
430
It really is a bet on Bitcoin's volatility and Bitcoin's downside.
431
And as an investor, not only is that market a thousand times bigger than people's willingness to bet on some widget companies,, volatility and downside, not only is it just infinitely bigger and will continue to get bigger if crypto and Bitcoin continue to go up, but each company looks more alike than they do different.
432
And I think it makes it easier for hedge funds or capital to come in and do this at scale and in mass.
433
And so, I think it's going to be more sustainable than we think it is on the surface.
434
And I think it can get a lot bigger than this.
435
Do you agree with that for the Solana and Ethereum ones?
436
Bitcoin, I can buy because the market cap is just so large relative to the debt issuances that it doesn't seem that crazy to imagine people care about the duration risk.
437
But in Solar ETH, it does not seem that's going to be how many can there sustainably be for Solar ETH?
438, at the end of the day, I think it's also a function of the size of the spot derivative markets, right?
439
If there's a huge Ether derivatives market, right?
440
It's not that hard to model or hedge the convertibles of an Ether strategy company, right?
441
And I think It's a function of just how big is that market in general.
442
If there's no market otherwise, if we're talking about, I don't know, pick coin market cap number 400 and you make a company out of that.
443
I don't think there's any demand there.
444 you can't do much with it.
445, it's hard to trade.
446
You can't hedge it, whatever.
447
But for things that already have a huge options market, we know how to price the upside and the downside of the asset, it's, it could get really big.
448
I just think there's a carrying capacity to these.
449 there's not, the world does not have infinite number.
450 for Bitcoin, I think people are fine with the duration risk.
451
But even for ETH, I don't think people want to take that long of duration risk.
452
You can see it in the funding rates.
453
You can see it in ETH options on the ETF.
454
The funding rates between Ether and Bitcoin are pretty similar.
455
They're not that different.
456
On the notion on the OI is if you if you OI weighted, it's very different.
457
I don't think you could eat up 10 of these ETH SBAT type companies.
458
I think, I guess that's my point.
459
We're going to find all of the markets so.
460
There's 10 for Bitcoin.
461
There's two for Solana.
462
No, no, no.
463
There's more than 10 for Bitcoin, right?
464
There's all these random companies adding Bitcoin to their treasury and in different markets.
465, there's not the same thing.
466
There's minimum 90 or I don't even know.
467
It's a huge number.
468
Well, but no, adding a balance sheet versus being just this.
469
Not just a strategy clone.
470
Outside the US, though, there are a lot of, have been a lot of announcements for Bitcoin leverage companies.
471
Sure.
472
But they're, but they're tiny.
473, they're small relative to MicroStrategy.
474
They're 1% of strategy, and they don't have,, there's no real corporate debt market in those countries.
475
And so,, it's, okay, it's not really the same playbook at that scale.
476
Yeah, the one thing that I want to talk about is that tweet that everybody was tweeting that it looks these companies are being set up to be some version of a future play the role of some future collapse at which GBTC or these types of stocks are at the center.
477
And we also wrote about that and it feels it would only really happen if you could take out loans against these.
478
And there are other factors,,, MicroStrategy could probably get whatever terms it wants, whereas some of the other players might go out further on the risk curve and do things that are,, just prime them for,, more downsides, I guess, when the markets go haywire.
479
So point is, if for whatever reason there are lenders that are willing to let you borrow against them or something, I guess that's how it would happen.
480
But it is also something where you could see some cascade, right?
481
Where the price of Bitcoin drops for some reason or another.
482
And then maybe some of the, yeah, the in the long tail, these companies that are, that aren't getting as good terms for their funding their purchases, but then they have to sell and then that causes a cascade.
483
So I don't know, those are just my thoughts, but it was just interesting to see so many people tweet about that.
484
And,, as I, as far as I understand right now, I don't think you can borrow against these, but I just thought it was interesting that JP Morgan is now going to allow you to borrow against Bitcoin ETFs, which I,, Jamie Diamond is famously pretty anti-Bitcoin, but clearly his company doesn't mind making money off of all that.
485
But,, who knows?
486, if things get ratio, though, right?
487
What?
488
Yeah, it's a pretty low LTV, right?
489
Yeah.
490, there's a few things.
491
I'm not the only broker to do that, but the LTVs are all fine.
492
Yeah,, every other broker has done it except them, basically.
493
Yeah.
494
Oh, for wait, for ETFs?
495
I guess I didn't know that.
496
For ETFs.
497
Well, I guess I just mean if you're trading, you're usually your broker will offer you some form of margin.
498
And I think David Morgans was pretty conservative.
499
And you can definitely borrow against MicroStrategy.
500
Let's put it that way.
501
But not at some crazy LTV, but most brokers will offer you short-term loans.
502
Oh, okay.
503
So do you think that then does that explain all those tweets where people were saying it could be the future GBTC?
504
I think it's these collapses never happen in the thing that everyone's watching.
505
Yeah, exactly.
506
Totally.
507
It's a little too much of a.
508
Except for Terra.
509
Terra.
510
Everybody was watching Terra.
511
Well, everyone knew the failure mechanism for it.
512
Well, not everyone, but some people.
513
Yeah, definitely not everyone.
514
There was a lot of Trad 5 bros who were aping in who had no idea how to do it.
515
So I feel the failure mechanism for this stuff is more if one of them goes into the SP 500 and then right after it enters the SP 500, all these ETFs are forced to buy it.
516
But then in the first window before the SP rebalance, the coin crash is so high that it should have dropped out because it's selling debt that is duration of when the next rebalance will happen, which is when it's kicked out.
517
And there will not be this forced buying.
518
Because,, when you're added to SP 500, there's a million funds in ETFs that just have to constantly buy your stock to track it.
519
And if Bitcoin crashes a lot right after you get added and you start issuing debt, the thing is, you can issue debt very cheaply because everyone thinks their stock is going up because you're constantly being bought because you're in SP 500.
520
But if the crypto assets crash enough, at the next SP rebalance, you might find it.
521
Oh, but the debt these issuing now does not have any claim on the right conversion.
522
You can't take him into bankruptcy if he doesn't pay you back.
523
No, but the debt has equity conversion.
524
They're equity convertibles.
525
So the equity that gets the SS whatever it is, the newest, no, no, no.
526
MicroStrategy, again, they're a special beast, right?
527
That's the only one that could conceivably enter into the SP.
528
But all of these other ones are going to try, right?
529 their goal is to enter the corporate.
530, they'd have to go.
531
My goal is to enter the X.
532
No, no, no, no, no.
533
Sorry, sorry.
534
I'm just trying.
535
I'm just trying to, I'm trying to say,, if there were some collapse, this is the type of thing that,, I think I think at this point,,, I look, I don't know how he did it, but Michael Saylor has the most incredible access to capital for the shit that he's pulling.
536, at this point,, it's not Sailor who's going to tank the market, it's going to be somebody else.
537
And look, if the market does tank and Bitcoin goes to 50, 40K and it stays there for a long time, for fucking,, for years, then yes, Sailor is going to further weigh down the market, but it will not be him who does it initially, right?
538 that, that seems implausible.
539
Sayor will make it worse, but on the upside, he's increasing the cyclicality of the asset, both the upside.
540
And if we have a downside, it's going to be harder to get out of that downside.
541
Well, I think the next leg up is going to be a good one.
542
So,, good for Sailor.
543
Okay.
544
No, no, I mad respect to Sailor for pulling this off.
545
That's why I'm a little, I find this boom in the copycats you should appreciate how crazy it is what this guy did.
546
I don't think you need to copy it because I know imitation of flattery, but this is a way to burn money on fire flattery.
547, it's, no, but if it works, even I just don't think anyone does, everyone is, has Sailor dollar Bitcoin dollar signs in their eyes who are starting these companies when you talk to them.
548
And you're always, I,, the immaculate conception surviving all of these crazy crashes.
549
Totally, totally.
550
Sailor's a gangster.
551
Sailor's a gangster.
552
There will never be another him.
553
And what Laura points out.
554
It's not that there will never be.
555
It will be a different game.
556
It will be a different game.
557
Yeah, yeah.
558
Not that.
559
People should not be compensated the way that Sailor was, right?
560
Sailor owns so much of MicroStrategy.
561
All these other people running the quote-unquote next MicroStrategy, they're all hired guns.
562
They're all mercenaries and they should not get paid the way that Sailor got paid.
563
They should be, oh, you have to optimize this financial metric that Sailor basically invented.
564
Because he realized, look, I'm a financial engineer.
565
And if you're a financial engineer, you should get paid on the value of your financial engineering, not on the value of the underlying.
566
So I think we're moving in the right direction.
567
It's just hard to get that excited about these things.
568
It doesn't feel the market is that sustainable for them.
569
I would love to be proven wrong that there could be 500 of these.
570
It just doesn't, it's, I don't know.
571
Yeah,, I feel what's going to happen is,, the reason why it worked for Michael Saylor is because he is a very good mascot, right?
572
So,, 21 has a shot because Jack Mallors is the same type of personality, but maybe for a different generation.
573
These are not my original thoughts.
574
I forget who said this or where I heard this.
575
But the point is, I feel for a lot of these, you need somebody to be that evangelist in the face of the company that will get people excited because otherwise, yeah,, financial engineering is important, but also things the terms that you could use to finance these purchases.
576
Part of whatever the magical juju is that Michael Saylor has,, that is an ingredient that's necessary from these executives, also.
577
I think.
578
I agree.
579
You have to scream, there is no second best.
580, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
581
Okay, okay, let's play a little game that I'll call fantasy CEO for one of these companies.
582, pick an asset, and, who it who in the world would be the best Michael Saylor of the asset?
583
So, who do you think for ETH and Sol, who would those honestly?
584
But you guys, this is why, because,, and oh my God, I got so much shit for the Max Resnick show that we did with Tarun.
585, and for whatever reason, we both, for whatever reason, people think that I hate Ethereum, but I don't.
586
But I had been thinking about this, and I was thinking for the Ethereum treasury companies, I was, who is that person?
587
And, everybody's, oh,, maybe Joe Lubin, but Joe Lubin, he, he, in my opinion, he is not as charismatic as a Michael Saylor,,, just, and I couldn't even think of who that would be.
588, it can, can.
589
Can you,,, so,, obviously, this is not something that Tullip would even want to do, so clearly, not him.
590
Not that I think he should, or or that anybody would even suggest him, but, he's the face of Ethereum.
591, other than that,, we've got the etherealized people, but, I don't know, they're don't forget the bankless guys.
592
We had a show, yeah, we literally had a show with David from Bankless, and we were, right, And we were, dude, you should you should be the guy.
593
I still, I still stand by that, he's the best I could come up with.
594
What about for Solana?
595
What about for Solana?
596
Let's let's Solana.
597
I feel Ansom.
598
I know it's weird to say Ansom would be good.
599
Ansom, no, no, I think he'd be good.
600
I think he has a little too much history with the meme coin stuff that I think would make it difficult for Wall Street to embrace him.
601
Yeah, however, raising convertible notes that does not seem his jam.
602
No, but Ansom, Anselm, if you're ever interested, clearly there's a three out of four, three out of four podcast hosts.
603
I agree.
604
But to your point about Jack Mallors, right, I think he plays that role with just Solana.
605
It's more of a young person's game, it's more about Gen Z and Gen Alpha.
606
I think Ansem would play really well for that.
607
Yeah, and frankly, the convertible stuff does itself, right?
608
Once, once you're the nth of these, it's, okay,, show me your metric.
609
Will people buy the colours?
610, also, even though legal docs are probably standardized for this.
611
Exactly.
612
What happened?
613, AI is running all of them at this point.
614
You don't need to worry about that.
615
It's pretty easy.
616
Yeah, but the thing about how we were talking about how the prices at which these stocks are trading is just nowhere near any fundamental analysis.
617, that is why Ansem would be a good quote-unquote mascot, as I'm calling it.
618 what I'm saying?
619
Because he's the meme coin guy.
620
He's the person who,,, he could be associated with some random meme coin.
621
And,, let's just face it,, for most meme coins, there aren't good quote-unquote fundamentals.
622
I think that's a good point.
623
Is that if it's the Solana, if it's a Solana microstrategy, it's not going to get distribution on CNBC, it's going to get distribution on TikTok.
624
And so, it's really, who's the TikTok mascot, not the CNBC mascot for this thing?
625
Exactly.
626
Okay.
627
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
628
We missed one very important asset for this, which is XRP.
629
Who is the XRP?
630
Because,, if you just, if you look at everything above Solana, the only thing we've missed are BNB and XRP.
631
BNB already SCZ.
632, it's, I don't think there's really any other mascot.
633
But, but, so, XRP.
634
They could just be Carlinghouse?
635
Can it be one of the leaders of the project?
636
We're just getting Ripple Labs itself goes public and just gets a bunch of debt and buys more XRPs.
637
Yes, that is perfect.
638
That's perfect.
639, that would be really funny.
640
They have an underlying business.
641
It's IPOable, right?
642, they've survived this SEC case.
643
It's the perfect setup.
644
You've convinced me.
645
You've convinced me.
646
And they have a stable coin.
647
Speaking of the meme coins.
648
But also, I'm sorry.
649
So I missed part of what you said, but are you saying it's because they already hold 50% of the Ripple or whatever it is?
650
Great start to the treasury.
651
Yeah, exactly.
652
Great start to the treasure.
653
They've already loaded up and they just keep buying more.
654
People thought the business model of Ripple Labs is selling wrong, wrong, it's to buy the XRP.
655
Oh, my god, if they pull this up.
656
But by the way, you guys, I don't know if you saw, there is an XRP holding company, this Vivo Power.
657
It's going to be, I think you're seeding it with 121 million.
658
This is a Saudi guy, right?
659
Yeah, yeah, Saudi, yeah, and it's just starting with, yeah, 121 million.
660
By Ripple Labs, you marked my words.
661, it would be really funny,, if Ripple Labs just did it because it's, it's the natural end point of this whole saga.
662
It's you start a coin just to have the labs company do this.
663
So they ended it.
664
So basically, then they would have played it all perfectly where on the way up, they make their money selling billions and billions and gazillions and gazillions of dollars just selling and dumping on retail.
665
And then at this moment in time, they pivot and then they start.
666
They just become an accumulation company and an XRP treasury company.
667
So I think it's your Lord.
668
It does not play out we've predicted.
669
Okay, well, so one last story I wanted to get to.
670
So circling back a little bit to stablecoin mania, there's a project called Plasma, which is supposedly a stablecoin chain that's affiliated with Tether.
671
There's a bunch of these now that are basically supposedly natively or quote-unquote natively issuing Tether, and they have zero transaction fees on the chain.
672
So the idea is that this is supposed to be better than Tron because Tron has fees, these have no fees, and they facilitate stablecoin payments.
673
So Plasma, you guys aren't investors in Plasma, are you?
674
No, okay.
675
So Plasma, they recently did, we're not investors in Plasma, they recently did an ICO of raising at a 500 million valuation via sonar, they raised $50 million for 10% of the Plasma supply at a $500 million FTV.
676
They had these vaults, which I think were liquidity vaults that they filled up with $500 million of demand in, I think, the span of seconds.
677
The top 10 wallets held 38% of the total supply.
678
Top 17 wallets held 50%.
679
One wallet alone deposited 50 million.
680
There was a gigantic gas war.
681
I think one person paid $100K to get in with their $10 million of USDC.
682
So we're seeing this ICO boom.
683
Now, this ICO took place on a platform called Sonar, which is a new product that was released by Echo, which of course is basically created by Kobe.
684
So Echo was originally a platform, or not originally, it still is, a platform for these syndicates that are led by individual syndicate leaders who syndicate deals.
685
And it's more traditional syndicate style investing where you have to be an accredited investor, usually in some jurisdictions to invest into these things.
686
But Sonar is a response to the fact that more and more people have been asking for ICOs.
687
And the idea is that Sonar, because ICOs are of questionable legal status, Sonar is a self-hosted ICO platform.
688
So you can, as a team, use Sonar software to run the ICO yourself.
689
But Kobe slash Echo, they're not running the ICO.
690
They have nothing to do with it.
691
They're just software providers, essentially.
692
So that's Sonar.
693
So these guys did this ICO.
694
I think they're European based and a crazy explosion in the ICO meta.
695
Laura, you and I argued recently on the show about whether or not ICOs are going to come back.
696
And I think I was pretty incredulous that, well, ICOs are super legal, so obviously they're not coming back.
697
Because I was the one who said, wait, don't you guys think this is happening?
698
And then you suddenly started reaming me and saying it's not.
699
And I was, wait, I think I'm noticing trends.
700
But anyway, yes, I feel vindicated.
701
I'm going to take my victory lap right now.
702, every first year of a Trump term has been an ICO boom.
703
Oh, true.
704
I'm just saying 2017 this year.
705
True, this is why you're not a public markets analyst.
706
No, True.
707
Yeah, yeah.
708
I'm just saying it's funny.
709 the first year of Trump's rule, last time and this time, everyone's saying ICO again.
710
Okay.
711
All right.
712
Yeah.
713
So Kobe was saying that,, they started Echo, but because of the syndicate model, people weren't in love with how they needed to get endorsed and how they didn't have full control.
714
And,, this allows them to do that.
715
And so I just find it so interesting that basically it's more the, what's the word?
716,,, because in my book, I wrote all about ICO.
717
So if you just look at the DAO, where they basically created this big, they got all this money.
718
And then once it was in the smart contracts, they realized, oh, shoot, we didn't build out any of the tooling for you to do anything once the money's in there.
719, we have no way for you to get the money out.
720
Then, of course, when the hack happened,,, that created issues.
721
And then,, we saw the janky version where,, people were doing this for my ether wallet.
722
And Taylor was dealing with people who, Taylor Monaghan was dealing with people who lost their money or was getting phished or,, scammed or whatever.
723
And now it's we have the adult version.
724
And,, I feel basically this is this long-term trajectory that we're seeing, where, back in the dot-com era, companies would,, be startups and then they would go public early.
725
Whereas nowadays, it takes forever.
726, people, companies, they just don't go public early.
727
So now we have a new function where you can get in earlier.
728
And, yeah, I understand there's risks and there needs to be education.
729
And there probably also needs to be some changes in the accredited investor laws, but at least in the U.S.
730
But the point is,, just when I look at the full span of what's happening across history and how markets are changing, it does make sense to me that there will be something more this, whether it is exactly this, because obviously there were a lot of problems with this ICO.
731
But yeah, I could see it becoming more and more of a thing.
732
All right, we got to wrap up.
733
Robert, you want to give us a last word?
734
Are ICOs here to stay?
735
ICOs are hopefully not here to stay.
736
Hopefully not.
737
Oh, shit.
738
Okay.
739
Now, next episode of the shopping blog.
740
We'll have to come back to this.
741
We'll come back to this.
742
Okay.
743
I think they're always going to come back in different shapes and forms.
744
The zeroth law of capitalism.
745
Whenever Trump's rule, whenever Trump's rule, the first year of every rule is part of the blue moon of ICOs.
746
The zeroth law of capitalism is everywhere first.
747
Everyone always tries to find a way to securitize things that people tell them they can't securitize.
748
Okay.
749
Inspirational.
750
Thank you, Tarun.
751
Thank you for the inspirational speakers.
752
You're welcome.
753
All right.
754
With that, we got to wrap.
755
Thanks, everybody.
756
We'll be back next week.
757
Thanks, everyone.
758
See you next time.
759
Bye.
