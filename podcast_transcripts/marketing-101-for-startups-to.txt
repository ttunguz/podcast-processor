1
If I want to understand my audience and where developers are landing and what they're seeing, I need to be like fully integrated with developer relations.
2
People just want to get out of their silos and to sit with somebody who's also trying to solve what seems like impossible problems.
3
Welcome to Web3 with A16Z.
4
Since our show covers both tech trends and company building, today's topic is all about marketing, including differences between marketing in crypto and traditional tech.
5
The conversation shares a candid look at what works and what doesn't when it comes to building reputation and community, attracting developers, hiring teams and agencies, launching tokens, building founder profiles, and more.
6
Our experts are Amanda Tyler, who was most recently head of marketing at the Optimism Foundation, and who was formerly at Polygon, Coinbase, and Google.
7
Claire Cart, chief marketing officer at Aztec, who previously was at Risk Zero and SoFi.
8
In conversation with Kim Milosevic, CMO at A16Z Crypto, who is formerly VP of Comms at Coinbase, and who has spent decades in tech at A16Z, Skype, Yahoo, and elsewhere.

11
What role should we play as marketing and comms people?
12
Like, should we be out in front or should we be more behind the scenes?
13
And I thought of you, Claire, because you've talked about how being out in front, it's, you know, maybe also because you want to sort of build your profile yourself, but also because it's been really just productive for you.
14
So maybe you can talk a little bit about that.
15
I think, like, you know, in my time working as a marketer and in tech, it's always been the assumption that you're going to be behind the scenes, right?
16
And I think that model works, right?
17
Like, I don't think that every marketer should be out in front necessarily.
18
My time in crypto, I've worked for very deeply technical founders who themselves aren't always as comfortable putting themselves out there.
19
And so we were often like missing that spokesperson or missing that opportunity to be like, okay, someone just tweet about it, right?
20
Like, we have a question, we don't know where to go.
21
You know, our industry is so small.
22
It's like, you just need to discover that needle in the haystack.
23
So I started putting myself out a little bit because of that.
24
But then also, you know, marketing is like so important in crypto.
25
Building a community is so important.
26
I think people just want to hear from as many executives as they can.
27
So I think marketers have like a different role to play in crypto or can play a different role.
28
I don't think we have to be necessarily 100% behind the scenes.
29
And then, yeah, hiring.
30
Like, again, it's looking for this needle in the haystack, right?
31
Like, there isn't as much marketing talent in crypto as I wish there was.
32
I wish there was more.
33
And like, we all have to cultivate it.
34
And I think it's gotten better over the past five or six years.
35
Being a known brand, like having people refer talent to you, and then also having talent be like, oh, yeah, you know, I've heard of you.
36
Absolutely, I'll take this call, even though I'm working somewhere else right now or whatever it may be, right?
37
It just really kind of like speeds things along.
38
Yeah, and I think it's especially a superpower when you're working with really early stage projects and companies where maybe they just haven't built the reputation.
39
So for you to bring some of your own profile to the table, I think it helps move the needle for the whole project.
40
I think it's been helpful for me to build a presence on Twitter specifically for hiring because you can build that trust with people who are interested in working with you.
41
And if you're especially working in an early stage startup, it's like, oh, they don't really understand what the values and ethos are of that company yet, but they know what yours are.
42
They trust you.
43
Yeah.
44
So they trust you and they are like, okay, that's fine.
45
I like what you've done before.
46
And I'm interested in doing something that you would be interested in doing.
47
So yeah, let's chat.
48
Yeah.
49
That's a really good point.
50
I think too, like, I do feel like most people go to work for people.
51
Yeah.
52
Yes.
53
And not companies necessarily, right?
54
You want to like the company mission, vision, the work they're doing.
55
But I definitely go to work for people.
56
And so knowing who that person is that's DMing me to come and work for them, like I am going to take that call.
57
Yeah.
58
Yeah.
59
Versus, you know, maybe feeling like, okay, I've never heard of this company because as you said, a lot of them are early.
60
Yeah.
61
Yeah.
62
Do you think like that is a crypto-specific thing or do you think that's just in general?
63
And I'd just be curious to kind of like also take a step back and talk a little bit about what you guys think is really specific about crypto marketing versus more general tech marketing.
64
I do think that crypto is more of a cult of personality.
65
I mean, there's always been cults of personality in tech, right?
66
Like we think about Mark Zuckerberger's to Cheryl Sandberg.
67
And, you know, and those people definitely did a lot to build their personal brand, right?
68
To write books and to, you know, do all these things.
69
But I think crypto is even more so.
70
Like for me specifically, like when I was in my early 20s, I built a really solid Instagram following based on like non-crypto stuff.
71
Yeah, like mommy blog stuff.
72
But then when it came to crypto, I saw this opportunity of like being a big fish in a small pond, right?
73
As a creator and like a content person.
74
I was like, whoa, it's so accessible to just like put your voice out there.
75
And there's so many little subcultures that exist within crypto that are very clear.
76
You can kind of like pick one and understand the cast of characters really easily.
77
Whereas like, you know, Zuckerberg or something, you know, you wrote a book, you said yourself, like it's the entry is so much like harder.
78
And in crypto, we're so early.
79
Like there's not many of us.
80
Yeah, I agree.
81
Like crypto is still so early.
82
And most of the action is really still like on the infrastructure side, if you think about it, right?
83
So how do you differentiate yourself as a project and like go after that audience?
84
Yeah, I think you stated the problem really clearly for us as marketers and that our addressable audience is so small.
85
So if you think about it, yeah, I guess it's 30,000 now.
86
I guess 2024 it was 23,000.
87
I know this because I often use it as my like ammunition to like, why isn't this going viral?
88
But I'm like, okay, how do the first 23,000 people a month actively contributing to repositories in our industry?
89
Yeah.
90
And I worked at Google like eight years ago for developers.
91
I worked in the DevRel side.
92
So I've always worked in marketing for developers.
93
And even at Google, I often would be like, well, there's only 28 million software developers in the world.
94
So we can only.
95
Views, my friend, right?
96
So they're same problems, but obviously the scale is like, it's 0.08%.
97
of software developers in the world that are contributing to crypto projects.
98
0.08%.
99
And I know that because I use it as well.
100
Yeah.
101
But I'm sticking this up here.
102
Yes.
103
And it's really important to remember that and to remember that your addressable audience is not a general audience.
104
Yeah.
105
It is truly a very niche, small, general audience.
106
And how you differentiate your product with a very niche, very niche, small audience is by understanding them one-to-one.
107
That's literally the only way.
108
So there's what do developers want?
109
You have to think about that, right?
110
If you're trying to solve the problem of, oh my God, our audience is so niche, how do we reach them?
111
Well, what are their problems?
112
Composability in Rollup World, number one, to build an application that is composable.
113
Number two, economic upside, right?
114
So how can I benefit from this very tiny industry, right, where I'm maybe not getting paid for providing public goods and software?
115
And then number three is a value system.
116
So how as marketers, do we build a value system that can attract developers to our cult?
117
The third one, though, really hits home for me because I think there's a lot of, if you go within a team and you're the marketer and you're trying to talk to product and edge and crypto research and understand, okay, like what makes this different and what would make this attractive to someone?
118
Most of them focus on like the things you can do with the technology, right?
119
But there's not a lot of focus necessarily on that idea of economic upside because anyone who joins you and wants to build is essentially saying, right?
120
Because this is their livelihood.
121
But then the values piece, like, I think developers.
122
I found like they really do want to join a movement.
123
They want to have a sense of identity and belonging because they're risking so much on this.
124
You know, like these platforms are early, the tech is early, and they might be leaving a comfortable job or, you know, not continuing their PhD program.
125
They're making really serious decisions.
126
And so I think feeling that there's a sense of belonging and a sense of place is so important.
127
And so, yeah, in addition to like, okay, this is what the tech can do.
128
And then what's it going to get you?
129
It's going to get you this opportunity and it's going to get you entree into this group, club, cult, whatever you want to call it.
130
And then the other thing I'd say is because there are so few people, I think in tech, like we are obsessed with this idea of scale.
131
And I think sometimes it really kind of like blinds us to how you bootstrap things when it's early and we're still early.
132
And so I always tell my team like, okay, we'll find a couple of things that we can scale.
133
You know, we have email marketing tools, right?
134
There are things.
135
But don't come to me trying to scale our entire developer program if you can't tell me all their names, their dog's name.
136
You know, not enough people.
137
And that doesn't scale.
138
There's some do things that don't scale in marketing and crypto.
139
That's just a fact.
140
So I see a lot of people trying to skip to the scale phase.
141
And I'm like, what are you scaling?
142
Like, who are these people?
143
Why do they care?
144
Get your first 10 developers on board and loving you.
145
And that's going to, yeah, that's going to move the flywheel.
146
Developers are like very strong word of mouth.
147
So, focus on the things that don't scale, and then that is gonna create like this, you know, kind of like rolling stone that just gathers momentum.
148
So, you know, there's a lot of these, each of these like layer ones have their own kind of cult, if you will, and own personality and vibe and culture.
149
You guys are both in the, it have been working, you know, very heavily in the Ethereum ecosystem.
150
And I'm curious, like, you know, how much does kind of riding the vibes of that Ethereum, like leaning into it, like, how much does that play into marketing for a layer two project, or does that not matter as much?
151
Amanda is more experienced in like the Ethereum ecosystem than I am.
152
So, I was at a layer one previous to Aztec.
153
And so, this is actually something I'm thinking through quite a lot.
154
Yeah.
155
Also, you know, the kind of the vibes of the energy around Ethereum, like, ebb and flow.
156
And there have been times when people are very excited about it.
157
Ethereum is going to save the world, so many amazing things.
158
And then there's also been times where people are, you know, upset at the leadership of the foundation or they have concerns.
159
You know, so it really ebbs and flows.
160
So, this is something that I don't know if I fully figured out yet.
161
Yeah.
162
Yeah.
163
Yeah.
164
I think, like, listen, in the roll-up world, every L2 is a cultural extension of Ethereum.
165
Ethereum has built this culture and this like public goods infrastructure in a way where it's welcoming to everyone and anybody, right?
166
It's permissionless, it's borderless.
167
We really want to see technology built solving different issues across all of these roll-ups, right?
168
So, that's what's special about Ethereum.
169
And what that brings us is co-opetition, which is the word I use often, like even when explaining what you know, building on Ethereum is like, or even when I'm explaining what the super chain is.
170
And I think that creates a very interesting place to be a marketer in because we're constantly trying to market the business, the L2, as a business, right?
171
The business is incentivized.
172
But as a marketer, you cannot forget why we're here and the foundational elements of why the roll-up is doing what it's doing.
173
And all of that is to scale the world computer Ethereum.
174
And I think if you weave that into messaging to answer your question specifically, that's helpful.
175
But over the years of marketing Ethereum, I find that what's actually the most powerful thing is if the technology can prove its value to Ethereum.
176
And then it gives us as marketers ammunition and energy to drive the Ethereum messaging.
177
It's one thing to put top of vault built to scale Ethereum.
178
And it's another thing to have your gas token be ETH, right?
179
And not allow custom gas tokens in your standard config for your stack.
180
Is that because you feel like the developers in the Ethereum ecosystem are that loyal?
181
Or do you feel like it's, I mean, you could argue like they just want to be building great stuff and it maybe doesn't matter so much that it happens to be part of Ethereum.
182
There is an EVM developer.
183
Like EVM compatibility is very real.
184
If you look at all the developer reports, there's definitely been a shift to other ecosystems like Gathering Steam.
185
But I think Ethereum is.
186
Well, I also wonder, just like, so Base has done a really phenomenal job.
187
And when people are drawn to Base, building on Base, do they really think about the fact that they're building on Ethereum?
188
Or are they feeling like they're part of the base ecosystem and Ethereum sort of value crop becomes more of a background?
189
When I think about this, I sort of think about the size and scale of an L2 versus like Ethereum and kind of like the resources that they have to deploy.
190
So in the case of Base, obviously they're part of a publicly traded company and they have a war test and a huge team and just a lot of resources, right?
191
I think for L2s that maybe aren't as well resourced, either in terms of the money that they have or the team that they have or the expertise that they have in-house, you know, maybe sort of attaching yourself to Ethereum more is like a really smart way to kind of associate yourself with like a larger brand that has like more pool and more credibility, right?
192
And you can kind of sort of like find your way in and see how you can like get developers or users that way.
193
I think for base, they can kind of go toe-to-toe with Ethereum, right?
194
In terms of like a lot of the resources that they have to deploy, right?
195
So I think for them, they can sort of stand out and say like build on base, build on base.
196
And you don't have to wrap the Ethereum messaging in as much if you don't want to.
197
I think it's a good point, though, Claire, that some of these L2s, some of them are in better, it's about the resourcing.
198
And so some of them are going to hitch themselves maybe a little bit more tight or closer to Ethereum if they haven't quite.
199
Whereas some of them, they're a bit farther along, like Base and, like you said, you know, pulling in the resources from Coinbase, like they can stand on their own a bit more.
200
I want to ask you, too, about you know, the role of community managers, developer relations, DevRel, and how that fits in with marketing.
201
Like, do you feel like that should sit as part of marketing?
202
Do you think that should just be a really tight collaboration?
203
And how have you seen that work?
204
I've built and led teams under both models, like one where it's kind of like an integrated, like, full-funnel marketing team, where everything from awareness, consideration, trial, conversion, and I would consider DevRel like, you know, to be middle and lower in the funnel, right?
205
They're trying to support the builders who've already heard about you to now take their first step or support them through like a deployment, right?
206
I think like there's pluses and minuses to both.
207
I think with Aztec, like our DevRels are much closer to our product team and our PM, like our PMs.
208
Because of the complexity of what we've built, like, I actually think that that's a good thing, but it does require, there is like quite a lot of friction, right?
209
Just to coordinate, like making sure that we're all targeting the same type of user, that we want to move through this funnel, making sure that all of our programs are linked so that we're not bringing someone in and then DevRel is sort of getting a handoff and speaking a totally different language to them, or vice versa, that we're bringing the wrong type of developers in at the top.
210
Yeah, what do you think?
211
I believe that developer relations and advocacy should fit with marketing.
212
Maybe it's just like my marketing experience in DevRel, but things like documentation being the primary surface, top of funnel.
213
Like I think of documentation as being like, you know, a developer Google is how do I build with the OP stack?
214
Where do they land?
215
They land on the documentation.
216
Who's owning the documentation?
217
Who's owning that language?
218
Who's owning the kind of like consistency of the funnel?
219
It's DevRel or product managers or product.
220
So if I want to understand my audience and where developers are landing and what they're seeing, I need to be like fully integrated with developer relations.
221
I also see in crypto specifically, DevRel is turning more into like this public-facing content, content creators.
222
And they need to, because there are so many problems with developer tooling today that are causing so much friction for anything of value to be built in our industry that I think it's so important to see a face on a video explaining this is where you find the thing in the documentation.
223
This is how you build.
224
These are the problems I'm solving.
225
I've gone through like, we had like an hour-long coding sesh video.
226
God, it got so many views and engagement.
227
People just want to get out of their silos and to sit with somebody who's also trying to solve what seems like impossible problems.
228
Yeah.
229
So I think DevRel and crypto specifically should probably have more of like a marketing flavor.
230
It's really important for all of these projects to be, you know, promoting and kind of raising up the developers that are building on their chains.
231
And I'm curious, like, how do you guys think about that?
232
You know, how much focus do you put on it?
233
How much focus do you think should be put on that?
234
My sense is it kind of depends on where you are in your L1, L2 journey.
235
I think if you're farther along or a Solana or whatever, obviously a lot more of the focus should be on, you know, what are people building on our chain, where you're maybe a little bit earlier, like in Aztec, you kind of have to do a little bit of both.
236
But I'm just curious how you guys think about that.
237
Developers really like hearing from and about other developers.
238
And so I think like the more that you can highlight success stories, it goes to the upside, right?
239
Like what's in this for me?
240
It lets you project the culture of the community, of the chain, of the tech, right?
241
Like we're building in the privacy space, so that obviously attracts people with like a very certain values orientation.
242
So I think like showcasing developers who are active in your community and who are finding success is a really, really effective way to market to developers like that really does hit like what can the product do?
243
What's in it for you?
244
And like what are the values and cultures that you're going to find here?
245
It's a little bit of a cold start problem, right?
246
Because when you're trying to attract your first couple developers, there aren't success stories to tell, right?
247
And so then you do really have to focus on things outside of that, like, okay, what are the use cases?
248
What are you thinking maybe the potential economic opportunities?
249
But yeah, like for my team, as soon as we get those couple builders, okay, they're building and maybe they've raised money.
250
And, you know, there's all these different kind of milestones I think that we're looking out for where we really want to try to champion them like as much as possible.
251
And I say this to my team and I say it, I say it pretty openly.
252
Like, yes, I'm the CMO of Aztec, but I actually consider myself more to be the CMO of people who build on Aztec.
253
And so if you come and build on Aztec and you need marketing support, like you can call me.
254
You know, I'm your girl.
255
Like, I will go to that for whoever builds with us because that is something that you can do that's so high leverage for people in your ecosystem.
256
They don't have the resources to hire a full-time marketing hire yet.
257
So, how can we get them there?
258
Yeah, very similar to my world, actually, where it's a portfolio and how do I support the portfolio.
259
Exactly.
260
It's kind of that's my portfolio, right?
261
Doesn't always sound well, but no.
262
To your point, the wins that you get are very high-leverage.
263
Yeah, yeah, it doesn't, it doesn't scale.
264
And sometimes, you know, you're supporting projects, and you know, it's just all across the board, right?
265
Marketing's a priority for them one day, and you build this whole plan for them, and then the next day, there's a fire going on in your codebase, and they can't, you know, so it's not always linear, but I think it's one of the highest-leverage things like a marketer at a project can do in their ecosystem or in their portfolio of projects.
266
Yeah, I agree.
267
I look at marketing in this industry like similar to how you just positioned yourself as the human coordinator across the ecosystem.
268
Yeah, because it's not only lifting the developer stories up, but it's also being able to find them and deliver them to product managers and be like, hey, this person is having an issue with X, Y, and Z.
269
And I nerd sniped them into like, you know, helping us refine the product.
270
Here, take them, support them, help them.
271
So, it's yes, the visibility, but also like, simply, can you build the thing better with our direct one-to-one support?
272
I found you in this repo asking a question.
273
Like, I found, then I found you on Twitter, then I found you on Telegram.
274
Let's get your product into a place where it's really sexy.
275
Next level, you should tell them.
276
You should tell them.
277
Yeah, that's actually one of my questions: is like, how do you keep a pulse on your community?
278
So hard.
279
Yeah.
280
How do you, you know, and how do you kind of also filter through that feedback of like, you know, the noise and the signal?
281
And especially, like, there's a lot of bots out there.
282
There's a lot of fake stuff out there.
283
Yeah.
284
I'd love to hear your tips.
285
So we had just released a token standard that is an interoperable token standard.
286
And I wanted to see if people were immediately using it and to understand like where they were using it.
287
I wanted to find somebody integrating it into their launchpad, like at the very early stage.
288
So I went into the repo, I saw who was like cloning the repo.
289
I was like looking through all of the names.
290
I click each one.
291
And on GitHub, GitHub is like a social profile kind of.
292
So you can see like how long they've been a GitHub developer.
293
You know, like on Twitter, it's like been on Twitter since whatever.
294
So all of the names were like created their GitHub profile 20 minutes ago.
295
Created a GitHub profile.
296
Then I'm just scrolling, scrolling, scrolling.
297
And finally, I'm like, okay, we just released a token standard in New Year's.
298
See, I guess people think there's going to be an airdrop associated because the token is there, right?
299
So it's like, I'm looking, I'm looking.
300
And finally, I find a couple like real GitHub developers, right, that are in there using it.
301
Find their name, find their Twitter, message them on Twitter, ask them what they're leveraging it for, ask them if they understand.
302
Like, this has never been created before.
303
Do you understand what the use case is for it?
304
Direct one-to-one.
305
Got great feedback, like implemented it in the messaging, passed them over to product, was like, this person is using the standard right now.
306
Teach them how to use it in an even more efficient way.
307
So this is what makes Amanda great, by the way.
308
Even one-to-one to one.
309
I'm not kidding.
310
Like, it's like fully in the trenches.
311
Yeah.
312
Well, speaking of tokens, so there are a lot more network tokens.
313
So speaking about network tokens, I'm not talking about meme coins and so on.
314
They're being launched.
315
The regulatory environment's starting to clear up a little bit.
316
People are seeing blue skies ahead.
317
They're feeling like, oh, this is our opportunity.
318
We have companies, our portfolios sometimes are asking, is I want to hire a marketing/slash comms person who had done a token launch before.
319
Clarication.
320
And I'm kind of curious.
321
I'd love to hear your thoughts on like, how do you prepare for a token launch?
322
On and out, too.
323
What happens after a token launch?
324
And how specialized is that?
325
Like, how is that different than a product launch, for example?
326
Should it be positioned as a product launch?
327
So I'd love to hear your thoughts.
328
There aren't many marketers who've had a successful token launch.
329
Yeah.
330
Especially when they're like, I want these people that have done that.
331
I'm like, okay, so we're talking about five people.
332
Yeah, they're just, I mean, there just aren't many, there aren't many people, but I also don't think that it's sorcery or alchemy.
333
I think there's things you can pull in from like other marketing disciplines, right?
334
Marketing is, I always told my team.
335
Like, we can look outside of crypto to like, how can we understand this?
336
I think the thing with tokens is that they do function as a product, right?
337
Like, there's certain ways in which they're structured, which kind of dictate in many ways if they're successful or not, launch or long-term.
338
And so, you have to understand what you're launching just like anything.
339
So, I think saying, we're launching a token, you know, it's like, okay, like, you know, what are the tokenomics?
340
And then, how do you use that to build a strategy?
341
I think a lot of people approach token launches as, I need to pour all this gas on the fire and go super hard right away.
342
Maybe, based on your tokenomics and what things look like, maybe you should kind of start quiet and slow and build momentum.
343
I mean, there's so many different ways to approach it.
344
So, I think the first thing I'd say is try to sit down with whoever structured this product and understand what it is you're taking to market, right?
345
Don't be fooled by just token.
346
There are so many different types of tokens.
347
And then, also, I'd say, like, just get started early because launching a token really is a global exercise.
348
And if you've mostly been speaking on your brand channels in English to European and US audiences, and you haven't managed to go all over the world, where are people using tokens in their daily lives?
349
What does that look like?
350
Where are people trading tokens?
351
Like, what does that look like?
352
And trying to understand the different markets is like its whole own exercise.
353
And if you can't hire one of the five people who've done a successful token launch, you can educate yourself, right?
354
Just like you would if you were.
355
And then I think the other thing is, like, I do think that I tell the team, like, the day we launch our mainnet, the day we launch our token, that's day one of the work that we now need to do, right?
356
Don't see it as the end point.
357
Yeah.
358
It's the beginning.
359
Yeah, similar to an IPO, right?
360
It's similar with ASICs.
361
If someone said, let's go on a roadshow, do our IPO, and then, you know, hope for the best.
362
Like, that project would never get listed, and their investors would have a fit.
363
You know, the whole idea is this is your opportunity now to, you know, access capital markets newly, recapitalize the project.
364
What are your goals around that?
365
And so figuring all that out and then also seeing it as day one.
366
Like, because once you launch the token, there's a whole other host of dynamics that now come into play.
367
Is your team ready for that?
368
You know, now there's a global community that may feel one way or another about the token on any given day.
369
Those pressures can really affect the team, both because they're hearing these things externally, but also now because a lot of their compensation is tied to something that on any given day goes up and down, just like if you've ever worked at a publicly traded company, you know, like that comes into play.
370
And so I think there's a lot of things from traditional tech that come into play the day you launch a token.
371
Are there any concrete things that people can take away?
372
So one thing in particular is, you know, do you have a white paper talking about the token structure, tokenomics that you can put out there and make transparent?
373
That's something that we advise our companies to do.
374
What are some other kind of concrete things?
375
Like, you know, you talked a little bit about the feedback and managing some of that kind of feedback after the launch.
376
Like, what kind of systems can you set up?
377
Is it, you know, you resourced so that you can have people engaging and following that?
378
Like, I have this model for like community strategy and theory, and I won't get into all of it, but basically, like, I think you need to set out to decide like what type of people are you wanting to invest company resources in engaging with long-term.
379
And what I mean by that is, because you brought up earlier, you know, there's bots, now there's like LLMs that tweet, and you don't know if the person being very vocal about the progress of your project is a real person or not a real person.
380
You have no idea.
381
And so I think you have to get laser focused on like who are the type of people that we really want to tune into and listen to.
382
You know, we can take in feedback from across the market, but who are the people we want to tune into?
383
Hopefully, by the time you've launched a token, you've done a test net and you've cultivated that community of people who are like deeply aligned.
384
And so I would say, yeah, getting your Discord really well structured, making sure that you have things in place like weekly or monthly community calls where you actually get to talk to the people that helped you launch the network.
385
And if you're in like proof of stake, right, which I am and have been, those people are operating the network.
386
So they're holding tokens in size.
387
And that's to perform this activity that's really central to keeping a decentralized network running.
388
So I think you definitely listen to those folks, right?
389
You listen to your node operators, your validators, whatever you call them in your system.
390
So I think understanding how to listen to these big players who may not be institutions, they might be homestakers, but they really helped you bootstrap the network.
391
Tuning into their feed.
392
But I think if you try to like listen to everything online, you're going to get a lot, a lot, a lot of noise.
393
To switch gears a little bit, I mean, I think one of the challenges in the crypto world is that you have these split organizations, right?
394
You have like a foundation and you have labs, and I think marketers really struggle with figuring out like the role of each.
395
They're also resourced differently.
396
Sometimes you have marketing resources on both sides.
397
And I was kind of curious how you think about that, how you work within that world.
398
You know, how do you maybe stay kind of in line, but not too in line, right?
399
Because they have to be separate organizations.
400
But what are your thoughts on that?
401
What are the challenges of working in that kind of environment?
402
I've personally never experienced having a marketing team on both sides.
403
My team services both sides in my experience and work.
404
If you're specifically working for both, you have to understand how to weave both in together, but almost like separate the story in a way, if you're thinking about it tactically from like a social handle perspective.
405
I try to find thought leaders on the lab side to tell the story rather than labs telling the story itself.
406
So I'll get like a product person, right?
407
I'll give them a Twitter badge, which I've seen you do, right?
408
And saying, hey, we need you to distribute this information, these updates that we're making to, I don't know, custom gas topkins.
409
And that person will deliver the information and I'll re-promote from the lab side.
410
So I think there's like different ways to manage that.
411
That's how I've managed it by making mouthpieces for labs and then.
412
I've worked under a similar model.
413
I think the challenge for that is in any ecosystem, like when you have a duplication of resources, you're also paying all of those people.
414
And so I think it does get really tricky to have like both teams sitting in both orgs.
415
So there were some things I liked about it, and then there were some drawbacks.
416
So yeah, I see pluses and minuses.
417
I think like I loved having another like strong marketing lead in the ecosystem to collaborate with.
418
And, you know, we would have little marketing summits alongside DevCon, DevConnect, right?
419
To talk about like kind of our marketing goals for the ecosystem.
420
And that was really great to have someone else to work with and also maintain that really close relationship with all the contributors at labs, you know, because it gets harder to maintain that.
421
You're growing your team and foundation and it gets harder.
422
So there were some really good things about it.
423
But I think like a lot of ecosystems, especially when the markets are down, you know, treasuries are less and like maintaining, you know, a GC and a CFO and a CMO in both orgs can be a little bit taxing.
424
So, you know, every founder out there, or many of them, are looking to kind of figure out how to build their profile, some more aggressively than others.
425
Some maybe are coming at it and coming to folks like us and saying, how do I do it?
426
Whereas sometimes folks like us are going to them saying, you need to do this, right?
427
And I believe they all need to do it in some way.
428
What advice do you have for these founders that you're working with and others?
429
Because I know you're also working with some of the projects, you know, developers that are building their own projects.
430
Amanda, you said this really well.
431
It's like, how do you build your profile?
432
And it doesn't start with you.
433
Yeah.
434
Gosh, there's like, like, founders are people too.
435
Yeah.
436
But I think like my advice to a founder as I'm coming in to support with marketing is always let's build you up as a domain expert and not as a brand shiller, which is cringe, I think.
437
So, what I mean by that is let's make sure that your communication is providing credibility to the product without directly shilling the high-level, you know, narrative for the product.
438
So, let's highlight the problems that the ecosystem is having from your domain expertise.
439
Let's build in public through your domain expertise, leverage your channels, whatever that domain expertise is, right?
440
Rather than, yay, Super Chain Interop is coming, Native Interop is here.
441
Go use it.
442
When founders from Optimism speak, they are heard because it's not often, and they speak from domain expertise, which I think is special.
443
I wish they did it more often, but I think that they're following that formula pretty well.
444
I think whenever I'm working with founders, what I advise them to do is like think about sort of like the lowest friction way that they could share their ideas with the world.
445
So, for some people, like for me, getting on a podcast like this is fun and it's energizing, you know, and I love it.
446
If you asked me to sit down and write everything that I would have shared in this podcast in like a formal prose, that's a lot higher lift for me, like energetically.
447
And in terms of like mental friction, right?
448
Like, I'll procrastinate.
449
So, what I try to tell founders I work with is like, first, let's talk about the easiest way for you to communicate.
450
Like, what would be fun?
451
You know, if fun is writing a 10,000-word essay, like, let's do it.
452
You know, if fun for you is like a casual conversation with some question prompts, like, let's do that.
453
And lean into their strengths.
454
Lean into it.
455
And some are writers.
456
They prefer, but they're very effective.
457
They don't necessarily have to be on stage.
458
Right.
459
Right.
460
Exactly.
461
And that's the other thing.
462
It's like, if giving big keynotes is like sucking all your energy and stressing you out, like, maybe we don't need to, maybe we don't need to do that.
463
Maybe we do.
464
Let's just figure out the thing that is going to excite you and figure out how we can kind of like make that even easier.
465
Yeah.
466
And then figure out like a distribution strategy for it.
467
And then also just leaning into the things that they really love and care about.
468
You know, if they're funny and creative or if whatever it may be, like if we can inject some fun into it, if that's working for them, like, I think that we should try to do that.
469
I kind of think that's like, what is your comfort zone and how do we lean into that?
470
And to your point, like, reduce the friction.
471
And then what are your stretch goals for you so that you can continue to grow?
472
But just not maybe start there.
473
Like, I think if you have a founder who is just building their presence, figure out the easiest thing it is for them to show up for and then do it well and put all your effort behind it.
474
Like get everyone in the company to support it when it goes out and just figure out like how you can kind of have those real foundational moments that you can build momentum off of.
475
Yeah.
476
I mean, have something to say, say it well, and then kind of see where it goes from there.
477
Oftentimes, I have marketing folks coming to me saying, you know, my founders are really coming to me or expect me to figure out what they're going to tweet about, what they're going to write about, what the story should be.
478
It's, I think, unrealistic to expect that a marketing person's going to come in and magically come up with the mission, the value prop, the really core thesis, the vibe, everything for the company.
479
It really should come from the founders.
480
I'm curious what you think.
481
I see myself as a thought partner to my founders on whatever they need, whatever things they struggle with or whatever challenges there are.
482
Or I know someone from outside that I can bring in, right?
483
Like a really great ghostwriter if they do want to write that long-term content.
484
And okay, I can help them source support.
485
But, you know, there's a reason I didn't found the company.
486
Yeah.
487
Right.
488
And I think like founders carry so much of that like culture, the founding DNA.
489
They have the technical vision.
490
I mean, that's why they got backed.
491
And so, yeah, I think it's really necessary that that flows from them.
492
Now, what help they need with that is like a great conversation to have, right?
493
Like, and if the answer is, let's do an off-site and we need to lock ourselves in a room for a day and I really need to bounce ideas off someone, I would love to do that.
494
Yeah.
495
But I'm not going to be leading that session in terms of like the idea generation.
496
Exactly.
497
Yeah.
498
So facilitator, thought partner, just assisting however I can.
499
What refinements do we need to put it through to make it, you know, coherent and like well packaged?
500
And how can we?
501
Totally.
502
A successful marketer has to have a direct relationship with the founder.
503
There's just no way to build the heart and soul in crypto of an organization without having that one-to-one with the founder and understanding their true vision and why they're doing what they're doing.
504
Or the support system for their story.
505
Yeah.
506
Let's talk about resourcing, marketing, resourcing.
507
I'm often asked, you know, when is the right time to hire the full-time marketing person?
508
When, or should I bring in consultants or should I bring in an agency?
509
I know we all have a lot of thoughts about this.
510
Go ahead.
511
People ask me, what's it like marketing in crypto?
512
Like, people that have no idea.
513
I'm like, well, we're oftentimes marketing ideas and dreams, right?
514
So we're pre-product market fit.
515
Oftentimes, we're trying on new outfits, seeing what works, what doesn't work.
516
And I think there is a time and place to bring in a storyteller and a distributor for that, like building in public stage, right?
517
And I, this is my personal opinion.
518
I think the best time to do it is no later than like six months before the product is ready because you don't want to be showing something that doesn't exist for so long.
519
Then you get into a hole of like, ooh, what is this project?
520
Are they actually going to deliver anything?
521
What is it even?
522
You know, like there's just no point to hire a marketer before you even understand when your product is going to land.
523
I would maybe caveat it by saying you could bring someone in earlier if a lot of teams are very committed to building in public and they need the participation of their community to get to launch, right?
524
If you're running a really decentralized test net, and actually, before you have a quote-unquote product or before you have a mainnet, like you need an audience, node operators, to participate.
525
So, I think like when I talk to founders, I usually just try to peel back the layers of like, okay, well, what do you need to get this work done?
526
You know, if you were going to hire a marketer, what would they do?
527
And just like really asking those basic questions, sometimes you peel back to like, they feel a lot of pressure.
528
That's not a great reason.
529
But if it's like, well, we want weekly retros and we want to really like bring everyone along with us, maybe you do need like a part-time or a full-time person in-house to be like the driving force behind that.
530
And what do we think about consultants versus agencies?
531
Oh, gosh, I've had, personally, have had a lot of trouble onboarding agencies.
532
I think in our industry, the domain expertise and knowledge base is so niche, depending on what project you're at.
533
You really have to take the time to educate the humans that are going to be participating and contributing to the marketing work.
534
And that takes time.
535
And if you want to work with an agency, you have to spend time educating them on the domain expertise of your specific product or else it's not going to work.
536
Yeah.
537
Agencies, I find, I mean, there's the really large kind of one-stop shop agencies in our space.
538
I think, you know, there's pluses and minuses to that.
539
Then there's like the really boutique agencies that do very specific things.
540
If you are skilled in marketing and you know how to assess agencies, like I prefer to work with more boutique providers because I'm bringing them in to do a very specific thing and I can work very closely with them to make sure that thing is a very high quality.
541
And so if you have partners you've worked with over the years and you know they're going to dig in and do great work, like those are gold to me.
542
But again, founders don't necessarily have those trusted relationships.
543
And so I think founders are a very tricky spot when it comes to like hiring an agency or getting boutique contractors.
544
But they struggle with like vetting them and managing them.
545
I mean, it's one of many things that if they don't have an in-house marketing or comms person, like if they're managing an agency, it's like to your point, you have to get them up to speed.
546
You have, I mean, it's only effective if you're talking to them constantly and bringing them in and treating them like, you know, a full-time person, which a founder just usually doesn't have time to do.
547
And, you know, and then you have to know what good results look like.
548
You have to know what the right expectations are.
549
And I think, you know, founders, unless they're particularly talented in marketing or have done it before, they don't know where to start with that, right?
550
So I think they oftentimes end up disappointed because they're like, wait, I just spent all this money and they think time, but we would probably say, well, you should have spent 10 times more time to get what you wanted out of them.
551
And then I just didn't get the results.
552
And then it was like, well, what were you expecting the results to be?
553
There's a perception, at least amongst the founders that I spent time with, that the minute they sign that agency contract, all marketing problems are solved.
554
Yeah, yeah.
555
And it's kind of like they've onboarded a marketing factory.
556
Sometimes, even just internally between your peers, it's hard to keep a handle on the narrative damage.
557
And you also have to keep layering in another layer.
558
Yeah.
559
Yeah.
560
When I've worked with smaller boutique agencies, I like to hand them a very small campaign with boundaries and a very clear narrative that I know is not going to change too much and just kind of package it up for them in a little brief.
561
And that seems to be the best way for me to work with an agency.
562
Oh, briefs.
563
Briefs.
564
You said my favorite.
565
Yeah.
566
So, in terms of structuring a marketing team, so let's say, you know, you guys come on, you're maybe the first marketing, full-time marketing hire.
567
Who are your first, second, third hires that you make?
568
I want to hear this from you because you just did it.
569
I did just do it.
570
I did just do it.
571
Okay.
572
The first person I hire is, I just think about them as like my ride or die.
573
So I really look for someone who I've worked with before, who I know gets my leadership style, and we're just going to be able to like get in person and like hash stuff out and just get our work done, right?
574
Because when you're the first hired, like, yes, I'm the CMO, but I'll run a Twitter account.
575
I mean, I'm not, I mean, you have to be a little jagger jill of all trains and no, no, no project duty or whatever is too small, right?
576
You just have to jump in and roll up your sleeves.
577
Exactly.
578
So like I look for the person who is going to do that with me and be super cool and actually energized by it.
579
And I think anybody who's building an early team, like hire someone you can really trust and work well with because it kills you building the team if now all of a sudden the person that you hired, you're like not vibing with and you're not doing good work with and your hiring plans get put on hold because, hey, wait a second, what about this first person you hired?
580
You know, they're not made up to speed yet.
581
So I really go with a known quantity.
582
That's a good point.
583
I mean, I think.
584
And so, if you can find somebody in the first two hires that can do more than one thing, they're not overly specialized.
585
It gives you more flexibility if you know the headcount gets frozen all of a sudden.
586
Exactly.
587
You have to pull back.
588
You can do more with what you have.
589
Exactly.
590
Everybody on a marketing team at a crypto organization should be able to write a tweet, format an email, host a space or a podcast.
591
Everything.
592
You should be able to do everything.
593
It's true.
594
You should be a generalist.
595
And then the second bit is: what vertical are you specializing in?
596
What vertical can I go to you?
597
Do you know the metas that are servicing in the trenches this morning on the feeds related to DeFi?
598
Great.
599
That's how my team was built out.
600
I didn't hire like a social person and a product marketing person.
601
And I hired on verticals.
602
And it seemed to work well on our tiny, tiny team.
603
Yeah.
604
What do you think about hiring crypto-specific people, you know, crypto experience versus not?
605
This is a big question we get asked in our portfolio.
606
Or they'll just tell us, I am looking for somebody who is crypto native.
607
Yeah.
608
And what does that mean, though?
609
Well, what does it mean?
610
And number two, like you are immediately narrowing your pool for them to grow.
611
I know.
612
I think it is really crypto work.
613
If you are a contributor, you know, on the comm side or, you know, writing press briefs, like you can learn.
614
There's time.
615
We've all done it.
616
We all were not crypto native from Earth.
617
Like, you know, we didn't come out crypto native.
618
Like, everyone has an opportunity.
619
And if you have that, like, that passion and that fire, I remember when I did, I read every, I still do.
620
I read everything.
621
Yeah.
622
Like, I'm so well read on Twitter.
623
So anybody can do that.
624
If I can do it, you know, our comms manager can do it.
625
Yeah.
626
I also think, look, like, there are other highly technical parts of tech.
627
You know, you can recruit some of those people and bring them in.
628
Now, I agree with you.
629
They have to be raising their hand and leaning into crypto.
630
Yeah.
631
You can't talk somebody into this world.
632
Yeah.
633
I think like if you think about your business, are you a SaaS product in crypto?
634
Are you trying to attract application developers?
635
Try to find someone who's done that before, right?
636
Like we're in San Francisco right now.
637
We're like in the home of SaaS.
638
Yeah.
639
And so is there a really strong SaaS marketer and you have a SaaS product that you're selling in crypto?
640
But if you can kind of really think deeply, right, about what will this person need to do and then try to hire for that, you know, you might fill the role more quickly and just have access to like a much bigger talent pool.
641
It's also nice to get fresh perspectives on narratives.
642
Yeah.
643
I find.
644
Yeah.
645
Just simply get a fresh perspective.
646
Totally.
647
Yeah.
648
Welcome.
649
Yeah.
650
I was thinking, you know, so as part of the marketing mix, I think more in crypto maybe than other areas of tech, you have founders wanting to have kind of an editorial component to the marketing mix, right?
651
So, you know, they want to hire a writer maybe a lot earlier than some other tech companies might.
652
I'm curious what you think about building an editorial content operation.
653
And when in kind of the life cycle of building your marketing team, when do you see those roles most important?
654
I think content writers, technical writers, are only successful when they have a strategy roadmap in front of them.
655
I see some, yeah, I see some companies like only hire like a technical writer, and that person can translate the product roadmap for the organization.
656
But what they can't do most of the time is build it into that kind of bigger picture for the next six months.
657
You know, when I hear someone wants to hire a writer, I mean, again, I always go through this process of like, okay, why?
658
And what challenge are you facing right now that they would address?
659
Or, you know, what would this person do?
660
And if the answer is just like, well, they would write.
661
You know, it's like, okay, yeah, but.
662
Write what?
663
About what?
664
And, you know, and who's going to sit down with them to provide support on their writing?
665
Like, right?
666
Like, someone just doesn't just magically join an organization and start writing by magic.
667
It's collaborative.
668
Hiring.
669
Very collaborative.
670
So is the founder going to give time with that person?
671
Yeah.
672
Similar to hiring an agency.
673
Like, if you're getting that agency, like, who's managing them?
674
Who's directing them?
675
How are you bringing them in?
676
How much information do they have?
677
Right.
678
Yeah.
679
If you want the writer to be effective, they have to be pretty kind of like integrated into the organization with lots of access, which can also be challenging when you have a highly decentralized, remote, you know, project.
680
So yeah, I think.
681
Like I think hiring somebody like that kind of as a one-off before you have a marketing structure or leader in place isn't, it's just like unlikely to be as successful, right?
682
They need a manager, they need direction, they need a plan, they need to be integrated in order to be successful.
683
Yeah, this might sound a little like silly, but I always, if a founder is like, okay, I want to hire a writer, it's like, well, what's the one top, you know, what's the first thing that you would deliver, right?
684
And then what I usually say is like, that's not a full-time job.
685
Right.
686
I think sometimes founders just go way too quickly to like hire agency.
687
Yeah.
688
This, that, and the other.
689
Yeah.
690
And they're not like drawing on, you know, their, and now you can't draw on your network like all the time to build your company.
691
Like there's limits to it.
692
But if you really want someone to come on to put out this one piece, like how else could you get support on that that isn't hiring this person that I don't think is really going to be successful?
693
Crypto is so incredibly international.
694
And I think that these projects go international so much earlier than your average tech company, right?
695
And we're often asked for like, do you know somebody, you know, do you know, you know, people on the ground in Vietnam that can help us or Turkey can help us or all these different places?
696
And how do you think about resourcing things on the ground if there are launches or activities in some of these very specific and very global markets?
697
It's all relationship-based.
698
You have to know the person, I think.
699
And I know that's so hard.
700
That's a really hard barrier to clear.
701
But I think if you find yourself wanting to activate in a market and you don't have local contacts, contact your network and get an introduction because you just face a lot of challenges, right?
702
You don't know how business is done in that country.
703
So like someone could be proposing something that's really normal and effective.
704
People work very differently in different countries, like a lot of work is more trust-based.
705
People won't necessarily require contract up front, which is like very odd in the United States, right?
706
But that's how people work, they want to work for a month and build trust.
707
So, there's just like so many reasons why I think you need a really warm intro, and then also just you know, they're a world away and they're 10 time zones away, and it's like very hard to actively manage and onboard folks.
708
There could be a language barrier.
709
We have socialized Discord channels, which made it much easier to identify humans that were participating and super engaged.
710
Yeah, that's a good point.
711
Yeah, and then what we did was we educated them on the documentation, and we essentially had like you know, somebody in Argentina who was you know handling the developer relations stuff.
712
We're building a decentralized network of culture, like that's what we're doing.
713
And the best way to harness it, I think, is in like the tools that we use every day to build relationships online.
714
So, localizing channels and Discord was the way that I did it.
715
I love the homegrown strategy for the community piece.
716
I think there are those moments in every project's life cycle where you really are like trying to pull people in and rally them towards a central cause.
717
And when you see people who are super passionate and they're like, I'm a native Russian speaker, and like I've been waiting for this project all my life, like this is what I live for.
718
And you see them showing up and contributing as a volunteer, trying to find a way to like get them on board, whether that's as a paid technical ambassador or hosting local meetups.
719
Um, so I think you can use that as well.
720
Like, hopefully, when you decide you need to enter a market, you aren't going in cold.
721
Hopefully, you already have some ties, and then hopefully, you can ask if you do want to go with like a paid service provider, right?
722
Like, I need a PR firm in this market, I want a KOL firm in this market.
723
Hopefully, you can get warm intros through that.
724
But, yeah, it's really hard to like, I think retrofunding has its pluses and minuses, but I think like one of the big pluses is you do get to see the see the work.
725
Okay, events.
726
We love our events in crypto.
727
I'm curious, like, what do you guys think of the role of events?
728
How successful they are.
729
How do you approach those?
730
I'm learning and learning.
731
I continue to learn how effective they are, how we can make them effective.
732
So, over the last year, I really, when I joined Optimism, Jing was like, Okay, we spent a lot on events last year.
733
What are you going to do around event?
734
I don't want to do events.
735
Well, Jing, you can't like just kind of 100% back off, but let's figure out how.
736
I understand, though, right?
737
I understand the hesitancy.
738
There's a lack of ROI, yeah, right, that we bring home.
739
Brand awareness is often very difficult to measure from a marketing perspective.
740
Yeah, so how do we measure the success of an event?
741
There are many different types of events, right?
742
So, you can't say all events are bad.
743
I found in the last year that I was the most successful in hosting small, really, really targeted like VIP dinner type of events, right?
744
What is our goal?
745
Our goal is to earn business, build relationships.
746
Why do we go to events?
747
We go to events for BD.
748
I don't know what they do, they shake hands, they assign cuts.
749
I don't know exactly what they do, but they're bringing home, they're bringing home good stuff.
750
So, why don't we create a space for them where we can bring all the big players, high signal folks, into one place and get business done?
751
Like, that's why we go to events, right?
752
We also go to events to build brand awareness.
753
Yeah.
754
And I found in the last year that I can do both, spending a quarter of the amount, right, while getting work done and being able to come home and say, okay, these are the individuals we met with.
755
These are the deals that we've signed.
756
These are the relationships that we've built.
757
You can't do that when you're hosting, you know, a 3,000-person event.
758
You just can't.
759
I think it's also really hard for smaller brands to be effective with events.
760
Oh, yeah.
761
It's so noisy.
762
I think if you've already got a decent amount of brand awareness, people know what to expect when they come to an event.
763
It's effective for us.
764
They know that they're going to get, first of all, a high-quality event.
765
There's going to be good people there.
766
Networking, yeah.
767
Yeah, the networking is great.
768
But I agree.
769
I'm like, do we need to be at every one of these?
770
I don't think so.
771
We should be really, really targeted.
772
Yeah.
773
I think for us, I usually try to sit down at the beginning of the year, map out our product roadmap and our objectives, because I think your event strategy changes as your product roadmap matures, you know?
774
Timing.
775
Yeah, timing.
776
If you look at your calendar and realize that you're going to do a massive launch, could you do it in tandem with an event?
777
Does that make sense or not make sense?
778
So I think like trying to map the event calendar to your product goals, your product roadmap is really important.
779
And then I think like one challenge with events is there's often this kind of like, there's this event budget, and I think people sometimes see it as like a little bit of like a slush fund in a way in that.
780
And so, oftentimes, without strong marketing leadership, I think what you see is you know, people's friends, hey, can you co-sponsor this event?
781
And of course, you want to build a relationship, you want to support the project, right?
782
The intention is really good, and so it's like, yeah, let's go in for our 5K and let's get our logo up there.
783
So, oftentimes, I find and find when I come into a team, one of the first things I have to do is I look, what's the last event, like sponsorships that we've done all last year?
784
What were our goals?
785
What were we trying to do?
786
You know, does that make sense from an ecosystem alignment perspective?
787
Like, should we be aligning with the modular ecosystem or more with the theory?
788
Like, where should we be?
789
And then, just kind of trying to talk to all the people and like close some of those things down, you know, let them know that like we're not going to be spending our money that way next year and map it back to the business goals.
790
So, we've also had a lot of success focusing on like one, small private dinners.
791
And then, secondly, we started doing a developer conference last year and now have done two.
792
And I think for us, because we have a DSL and it's like this really emergent community of developers, there's still ties as well into like the research community.
793
And they're really used to kind of like symposiums where they get to present their work.
794
So, kind of trying to bring all those things together to get people to really sit in a room and learn about the state of the art and then trial it and then see from there, okay, who were the 10 incredible people who attended this conference who we now want to get to build on our platform.
795
And that's really hard to do digitally, right?
796
It's really hard to like see the sparkle in someone's eyes and for the DevRel and product to get a sense that, oh my God, that person is just so good.
797
Like, it's really hard to figure out your ideal user, I think, sometimes when it's super niche and it's very emergent tool set.
798
So, I love events for that.
799
It's just, yeah, you find your one or two.
800
So, I love events for that.
801
Developer IRL engagement is a great thing to provide to the community for sure.
802
Yeah.
803
So, I wanted to end on memes and crypto culture.
804
Oh, we love our memes, and you know, the culture is both like very deeply technical, but it's also silly and irreverent and inappropriate oftentimes.
805
You know, how should you, this great question, Amanda, like how serious should crypto marketing be?
806
And how do you sort of balance the kind of this sort of fun side of crypto with also the kind of very technical, serious side?
807
I think it's part of the cult-building exercise of like us having our own language that we all know, but using it to tell different stories, I think, is a fun way to think about.
808
Um, there's definitely brands that really just use memes as their primary function of like storytelling, which is one way to do it.
809
And then there's the other way to do it where you could use memes to just help identify with your audience, right?
810
Um, in little pieces where it makes sense.
811
I love memes.
812
I just seem, I see them as a tool, right?
813
It's like one way to express an idea or a story.
814
Um, there is that meme about, you know, like, sorry that happened, or I'm happy for you.
815
I don't have time to read them.
816
You know, that one?
817
Where it's like, I say that in my head almost every time.
818
I know, I know.
819
And I actually think about that meme a lot when I think about how to use memes.
820
So in tone rules, like what works for us, what doesn't work for us.
821
Yeah, ones that are like lighthearted and really seem to touch a nerve of like, oh, yeah, you know, if you loved what we were doing, you would be so upset if this happened.
822
And like getting a really good caption, I think it's fun.
823
And then social media managers are people too.
824
And I think, you know, if you tell them like, hey, the entire account is going to be super serious.
825
And, you know, I think letting them have a little bit of fun in their job.
826
And like memes are a part of how our industry communicates.
827
So usually I feel like the social managers do a lot better work if you give them a little bit of room to run.
828
And sometimes they come up with memes that also energize the team, you know, where you'll see it's shared on Slack.
829
And I think they're great communication devices if you know kind of how they fit into your strategy.
830
Do you use any memes in your job?
831
You know, not too much.
832
I mean, I think we do a little bit here and there, but I think we're just trying to more support like the projects that are doing it and support what they're putting out there versus like maybe injecting too many of our own.
833
Yeah.
834
But I agree.
835
Like I think we should have fun.
836
And some of our tone things are like, we're never going to be negative on a founder or project, for example.
837
So even if people are having fun and people are being like silly, maybe dunking on somebody, like we're never going to join in on that.
838
It's just good to know kind of like what those barriers are, I guess, like the borders of where we want to stay within our own tone.
839
But we have a very active channel of sharing them all, which just is great.
840
That is fun.
841
That is fun.
842
Well, thank you both.
843
This was amazing.
