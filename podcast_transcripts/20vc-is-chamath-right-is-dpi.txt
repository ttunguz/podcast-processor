1
Will we look back in 20 years and say open AI was a fundamentally important company?
2
Maybe.
3
Every company's market share is up for graphs when there's a platform shift.
4
The hyperscalers have taken very good, cash-efficient businesses, and they would break Mr.
5
Buffett's heart because they've turned them into CapEx hawks.
6
Public company investors are just mean VCs on steroids.
7
This is 20 VC with me, Harry Stebbings.
8
Now, it is my favorite show of the week.
9
Jason Lankin, Rory O'Driscoll, and we have a guest joining us for the first half of this show, Sam Lesson.
10
The discussion,, oh my gosh, it got a little bit spicy on what companies matter.
11
Does open AI even matter?
12
Is one of the questions we discussed today.
13
And then we break down IPOs, we break down QIIME, we break down Circle, we break down Mary Meeker's AI report.
14
It is a fantastic discussion.
15
I so enjoyed doing this.
16
I would love to hear your thoughts on what you think of this style of show.
17

Now let's switch gears from cloud innovation to the future of mobile and how one company is turning your screen into real returns.
41
We spend nearly half our waking hours glued to our phones, upwards of 50 hours every week.
42
Recently, one company transforming this reality stood out so much I personally became a shareholder, Mode Mobile.
43
Mode Mobile created the earn phone, the smartphone that pays you for daily activities.
44
Instead of big tech profiting billions from our attention, Mode returns over $325 million directly to users through earnings and savings.
45
Mode's revenues surged an incredible 32,481% in three years, recognized by Deloitte as 2023's fastest-growing software company in North America.
46
And here's why I'm excited.
47
Mode's equity offerings have raised over $30 million from 20,000 plus retail investors, one of 2025's standout public raises.
48

51
You have now arrived at your destination.
52
Guys, I am so excited for this.
53
We had so many interesting things that we want to dive into this week.
54
I just want to start with diving in on the deep end on a series of Chamath tweets.
55
And Chamath basically said, hey, TVPI is bullshit vanity metric.
56
You can't eat IRR.
57
You can only eat net DPI.
58
When you read this and when you read his quite opinionated stance, how did we feel?
59, I hate agreeing with Chamath on principle, but I agree with him.
60
Well, what's interesting?
61
If you read the Wall Street Journal article on Tom Obravo, they just raised a $34 billion fund, right?
62
Harry, your buddy.
63
So what the Wall Street Journal said, that's a record fund for PE, 34 billion.
64
It's a record.
65
But Q1 was a low point.
66
No one raised a $5 billion PE fund because of lack of liquidity.
67
So it's ties to Chamath's point, which is if you have the liquidity in today's world, you're going to get the capital, right?
68
Tom O'Bravo had $30 billion in distributions last year.
69
$30 billion.
70
I think that exceeds most guests, right?
71
$30 billion in distributions.
72
Not paper markups, but distributions.
73
Look, from my perspective, this is simple, right?
74
There's two very different games that are called venture capital or even private capital in general.
75
One game is making people money.
76
Finding companies early, making the right bets, paying the right prices, and selling.
77
And that is a DPI game, and all that matters is DPI.
78
And that's the game I to play.
79
That's the game I think I value and I respect.
80
There's also an asset gathering game.
81
And the asset gathering game does exist.
82
And here's the thing.
83
I say this as a seed investor with full transparency.
84
As a business, the asset gathering game is a better business.
85
If you're just in it to make money, you're an asset gatherer.
86, that's what the market wants.
87
And we can talk about why in the whole nine yards, the public market wants that.
88
They care about fees, et cetera.
89
The problem is, I just am an intellectual snob and I have no respect for asset gatherers.
90
I think it's a stupid game.
91
I think they're just two very different things that are called the same thing.
92
And you just should be really sober about what game you're in and what you're trying to do.
93
I think it's really fun that we had this conversation and we ended up thinking that Chamat's on the side of good.
94
Nice job, Sam.
95
I'm the first to say,, I think that's wild that I agree with Kamas.
96
My default instinct is to completely disagree with him on whatever he says.
97
But in this case, I happen to agree with him.
98
I'm comfortable disagreeing with him.
99
I honestly thought it was a trite comment.
100
It's one of the very typical Chemat comment.
101
On first glance, it sounds smart, but on deeper analysis, it's vaguely right, but not useful.
102
Obviously, he cited his 2013 and 15 vintage funds.
103
Obviously, at that point, DPI is the only thing that counts.
104
If you're 10 years in and you're still selling promises, then you're in trouble.
105
So that's a trivially obvious comment.
106
But to say TVPI doesn't count, the truth is, venture is investing in illiquid assets for five to seven years with the expectation of making a greater return.
107
That means that for five to seven years, you don't have DPI.
108
You've consciously, you've consciously undpi'd yourself.
109
You've taken money and you've given them a tie in the ground.
110
In that period of time, you have two choices as an investor gauging these guys.
111
You can say, TVPI means nothing.
112
I'll stick my head up my ass and I'll look in seven years.
113
I'll see how they're doing.
114
Or you can use TVPI for what it is, a proxy, a loose proxy for performance.
115
I'll be more direct with you.
116
Again, we don't know each other.
117
Here's the upshot: you have to understand that LPs are just incentive-driven.
118
And from an LP, what you should do as a rational human being, if you were, it was me investing in a fund, you say, yeah, the money's in the ground for five years.
119
And after that, we'll see where we're at.
120
And that's all that matters is what you deliver.
121
I know full well, I know this is an investor, that the marks that you made up or the marks because SoftBank listed something somewhere are completely irrelevant.
122
In fact, the negative signal in a lot of cases.
123
The marks are irrelevant and stupid.
124
Now, here's the reality: institutional LPs are people too.
125
There's some junior guy who wrote the check and he wants to get promoted.
126
And he exists in an organization that's trying to deliver something.
127
He doesn't want to wait seven years to get promoted, right, for making a good call or a bad call.
128
And so it really is just a marketing thing where you're saying, hey, I'm going to give the person who wrote me the check some marketing thing they can then use for their own internal purposes because everything in life is about get laid or get paid.
129
If you had two funds three years in and one of them had no mockups and one of them was a 2x TVPI, would you regard those two funds as exactly identical?
130
No, what I would regard them as though, and this is how I do regard them when I look at my own portfolio or things that, it's very simple, which is how many credible things do you have that are going to be fund returners?
131
Just give me the list of four things.
132
I don't care where they're marked.
133, you either have a set of true, legitimate shots on goal for important companies and important outcomes, or you don't.
134
If a company is marked at 2x where it went in, softbank, some crazy person marked it up and some crazy.
135
Same with the choir.
136
But my point about the Chamad comment is to say it means nothing, to say it means nothing is a gross exaggeration.
137
There almost certainly is some signal in that data.
138
Let's take it.
139
Let's go right down into TVPI means nothing.
140
I'm willing to bet if you got some machine learning algorithm and looked at all the funds three or four years in had a TVPI of 2x, and all the funds that four years in had a TVPI of 0.8x, and then correlated that to the ultimate outcomes.
141
I bet you there would be data in that signal that says it has some value.
142
It's not the only source of data.
143
You're right, there are better sources of data if you're in a position to evaluate better data.
144
But as an LP, in the absence of anything better, there is a signal in the data, which means the comment is wrong.
145
It would be fun to be fun to look at.
146
I bet that firms that hold positions at zero or cost, or even are willing to mark down positions that are more honest about it in reality might.
147
I don't know.
148
We can look at it.
149
But the reality is, I think there's this,, as an LP in many funds, you have funds, you get their statements, and you laugh because they hold everything at ridiculous value.
150
The high watermark they can possibly come up with are these numbers that make no sense.
151
And you look at it, you're, this is funny.
152
But you're, oh, this is not real, right?
153
And I just think that it's because everyone has methodologies all over the board.
154
It's all marketing.
155
I, unfortunately, I hate being with Chamoth.
156
I hate it.
157, I've known Chamoth a long time, not well, but casually.
158
And I gotta say, it drives me nuts that I have to be.
159
But with him, all I care about early is give me five names that matter.
160
And all I care about after you've had enough time is, did you make me money or not?
161
Okay.
162
But I get your point.
163, it's zero is an extreme statement, but, we live in an age of memes.
164
We said we're living in this two-dichotomy world or this binary world of venture.
165
In the middle,, SVB did this great analysis, and they were saying that the middle of VC funds is getting really hollowed out.
166
In other words, your mid-tier firms in terms of size are really falling apart.
167
What happens to them?
168
Is it a game of the very small and the very large, do we think, when we look at this report?
169, you got, yes, there's no middle.
170
You can't be a billion-dollar venture fund.
171
Is a billion middle?
172
Well, what we target call it $200 million early stage funds.
173
That's what we do every few years.
174
I'm very confident we know how to deploy that.
175, I believe there's a market where you can, from a DPI perspective, make money on that.
176
It's not a great fee business, but it's a great DPI business.
177
I don't know how you make multiples on a billion dollars consistently in VC.
178
I think once you're doing 10, you're playing a completely different game of asset gathering and asset deployment where you no longer have the same goals.
179
So I personally think that the billion-dollar zone is the death zone.
180
Gotcha.
181
Good to know as a $900 million fund.
182
No,, I did look at the SVB then.
183
First of all, I was thinking, are they throwing me under the bus too?
184
I checked the data and they were saying the $200 to $500 was the middle zone.
185
So then I felt even more depressed.
186
Now I'm a small bohemian, which is even more degrading.
187
I'm a low-rent conglomerate.
188
I think in the end, you have to be sized for the stage you're playing at to achieve the portfolio construction you want to achieve.
189
And I'm pretty confident that our typical check size is 20 to 30 million and you have 30 to 40 million dollar rounds.
190
We want to get 30 checks.
191
The map works.
192
30 deals total.
193
So I think you have to be sized for the game you're at.
194
It still doesn't mean you can't get it wrong.
195
And I do think, to your point, one of the things I've,, Jason and I have been batting this around over the last eight weeks is I do believe the impact of the conglomerates has made everything harder, including it's harder for us to make money.
196
I totally buy that.
197
The existence of people with $10 billion to spend makes it very hard for people with $900 or $500 or $600 million to spend to do that rationally in a way that probably, and I'd love to hear from Jason on this, in a way that if you're putting out $100 or $200 million, you're probably a little more inured to it.
198
Maybe the more interesting question is for founders.
199
I think the SUB report, which I wrote up, I don't think it was really saying 800 to a billion was the hollowed out middle, but I guess it is part of the analysis, right?
200
That they're not raising funds.
201
If that is true, then every founder wants to raise 20 or 30 million in their A now.
202
No one wants to raise an $8 million Series A is now three safe notes.
203
So does that mean in a couple years, your candidates outside of some scales are going to be limited to mega funds?
204, are they the only people that can't be able to write Series A checks?
205
Because 20 or 30 million isn't even a large Series A today.
206
It's a normal one.
207
So if there is no one in the middle, then we're all stuck with mega funds to fund the seed companies, right?
208, I guess it's an obvious point, but founders just, they better get to know folks with five or $10 billion funds before demo day.
209
Or they're all going bankrupt and these are all bad companies.
210, I think that's the other way to look at this.
211
I know a lot of people are pulling out of Series A's entirely because these are completely mispriced and these make no sense.
212
I think that the other possibility, right, is that we're in an era where there are good companies to be built and there are places to make money.
213
And if you are going into corners of the economy or funding things that other people won't, and so you're an end of one or an end of a few, looking at spaces that are really novel, there are places to make lots of money.
214
But I think we also have to look at the other way, which is, there's just a massive amount of capital being massively misallocated right now.
215
It's always funny when people simultaneously have the worldview that,, the big funds are going to win everything, but all the money is being wasted.
216, at some point.
217
Well, I think the thing that with human mind is, I don't even know that the big funds need to make that much money because they're asset gatherers.
218
They need to make enough money to generate gathering more assets and they need to justify their own existence.
219
And it's a good business.
220
That's different than saying you're trying to make a lot of money in venture capital.
221
Broadly agreed.
222
But I think, Jason, I want to go back to what you said because I thought it was spot on.
223
It's if there's only $200 million funds and billion-dollar funds, then you're exactly right.
224
Logically, those 20, 30, 40, 50 million dollar checks are going to come from only 10 names who are writing 40 of them a year, not eight us.
225
That's possible, but it's just a weird fund construction because those people are then going to be writing 40, 50, 60 checks of this size.
226
You're going to have a very spread out partner base.
227
I don't know if they'll be able to meet the founder needs where it is.
228
Is that not what your insights have today, though?
229, we've mentioned before the outcomes that they have with your hinge health is returning 400 million on a 6 billion fund and then having hundreds of positions and that being the construction they have.
230
Yes, it is the construction they have.
231
But at some point, it gets easier when you're running big sums to put big money in a smaller number of companies than try and diversify away.
232
If we're trying with 900 million to have 30 A's or B's, someone who's running 9 billion, if they were trying to do the same thing, would have 300 A's and B's in three years.
233
It would be silly.
234
So at some point, it becomes a part of their business, but not all their business.
235
And then I think Jason's right.
236, it's so funny.
237
We're going to talk in a few minutes about, and Sam mentioned earlier, this idea of a lot of A's are struggling to be raised.
238
The only way that worldview makes sense is what Sam said: if you have a world where people, can I call them mid-sized funds, quote-unquote, can't survive because of the big guys, and the big guys are, quote, stealing all the good deals.
239
And at the same time, we're also saying many companies are struggling to make a series A, get a series A raised.
240
Those things are common almost opposite to each other.
241
One says capital is scarce, and one says capital is plenty, and the big guys are.
242
I would say,, the way you resolve that illogical seeming statement is quite simple, which is every generation, there's only a few companies that matter.
243
Yes.
244
Most of the money at Series A is completely wasted.
245
And they might want it in larger quantums.
246
That just is, it's a war of attrition, right?
247
Which is more money being lit on fire.
248
Now, the mega funds will just win, it can win because they can say, okay, look, I'm going to plow a gajillion dollars at almost any price in.
249
And because of AI, whatever argument they want to make, there's no upper bound, right?
250
And so they say we make lots of money just on lots of money being deployed.
251
And that can logically make sense.
252
Seed funds are fine because you still have to be in winners, but it's just a multiples game, right?
253
Which is if you're in it at zero, right?
254
Then,, you can make a bunch of checks and make the math work from a DPI perspective.
255
You also have a nice benefit, which I very much appreciate, which is I really strongly believe private to private is an important future.
256
And I love being early and small and first because I can sell into the private markets in a way that you can't if you've written a $30, $40 million check into the series A.
257
You're too big, right?
258
So I think those two things survive.
259
What do you think about?
260
So for selling, if selling early, right?
261
Selling in secondaries, unicorn secondaries, how do you think about the goals?
262
Is it one extra fund, two extra fund, half?
263
Is it just risk allocation?
264
I think if you have a smaller fund, it's really, it's interesting.
265
It is interesting because you get,, I just the other day, I had a 1X exit opportunity to return the fund once.
266
And one of my anchors was I also brought them in as part of the deal, and we talked about it, right?
267
They followed me, so it was less for them.
268
But for them, it would have been a very high IRR and me a 1X, right?
269
That sounds good on the internet, but then it's gone.
270
Yeah, it's all gone.
271
There's no more returns.
272
In the end of the day, there's a few things that matter.
273
The number one rule as a fund allocator, you cannot sell the things that matter.
274
Rule two is because we were one of the first investors in Alberts, or Astro Rockets, or plenty of things that got out and people were excited about, but thesis broke.
275
And so I think you have to be really honest with yourself, right?
276
And honest, and you're going to make mistakes.
277, I think one of the things I always say is, as an early stage investor, you get hundreds of shots to buy.
278
You get really good at buying.
279
You have so fewer shots at learning to sell that it takes much longer to learn to sell well.
280
But it's still as important as learning to buy well.
281
And I think you just have to be really honest with yourself, which is, is this an infinity shot or is it not?
282
And the second that the thesis is broken, and if not, if there's a buyer at a price that makes sense because someone else has different fund dynamics, maybe they already own a lot and for them, it's about rounding down their average incost.
283
Maybe it's their net capital allocator and they don't care as much about the mega return.
284 they have different goals.
285
There are opportunities that work for everyone.
286
Rory, can I ask you if it's not one of the companies that matter, is it lighting money on fire in the binary way that no, I'm glad you came back to that because I would say, again, respectfully, I disagree.
287
And it's a matter of degree, but no, I don't think that's a correct statement.
288
It is true in every decade, you look back and you go, the vast bulk of the value is driven by one or two companies.
289
It's a power law.
290
We all understand the mat.
291
To a landing era, there was a decade where it was Google and then everything else right and that's true and it's intellectually absolutely true so you could say to yourself if I didn't do Google I must have lit the money on fire But then when you make that sentence a few times, then you go and you look at your Schwab account and go, oh, I have money in there.
292
So I mustn't have lit it on fire.
293
There are more wins than the biggest win.
294
It is a power law.
295
I would prefer to have done Google than any, whatever I made money on in 2000 to 2010.
296
But I'm damn glad I did that one too.
297
And the overextrapolation of the only tweed deals make money.
298
So therefore, everything else at Series A is burning money.
299
It's true in that you prefer to be in Google, but it's not the only way to make money.
300, just in the last couple of weeks, we've had, as you mentioned, a couple of decent IPOs, Hinge Health, and we're going to have Chime, Mountain last week.
301
We have another one this week.
302
Take Hinge Hen.
303
Someone made $400 million for their investors.
304
20% of $400 million is $80 million.
305
I say this every time when someone at the office says, oh, it's just a 3X.
306
Every single one of you will cash the fucking check.
307
Every single one of you.
308
If I left them on the counter there, you'd all take them home with you, right?
309
$80 million is still real money in America.
310
And Roy, that's almost my point, but just to put you on Chime, Chime's a great example of this.
311
If you're an early stage investor, you're very sad you didn't sell last round in China.
312
And I would argue at $25 billion, or what the last round was done, when you look at that rationally, you'd say, look, it's a cool company.
313
Is it an infinity company?
314
Or is this a really great place where I did my job, which was to fund it early, to find it early, to fund it when money was scarce?
315
And now we have capital allocators who are making a different assessment.
316
I think the answer is you clearly would have wanted to sell last round.
317
And I think it's incumbent on investors.
318
I only know it's in the S1, but I didn't see any of the early shareholders make the cut on the principal stockholders.
319
When I look at principal stockholders, there's dilution, but I don't see any of the seed guys on the table.
320
So that says to me they probably sold the 20 some amount at 25 billion when I literally only see DST cross-link and they did their job.
321
That did their job.
322
But I think you not if it's at 250 trillion billion.
323
There's two separate things floating around, and I want to disaggregate them.
324
First is: I'm going to fight in defense of mid-tier.
325
Did the mid-tier investors who didn't do the seed but didn't do the $25 billion round, are they happy they did that round?
326
The round that Menlo did, I think was out of the BRC, it was a couple hundred million, can't remember what the pre was, they're damn happy they did that round.
327
And that's a classic example of a mid-sized venture firm making a savvy bet, doing good stock picking, long after the seed, but still making good coin.
328
To me, that's the first point, which is the validation that you can at that fund size, probably it was a four or five hundred million dollar fund then, make really good coin and move the needle at the fund level.
329
Second comment to your point, Sam and Jason, you're right.
330
You look back and go, hmm, I might have been marginally smarter if I had bought a two, three hundred and then sold at 25 billion rather than holding and selling at 12.
331
But the big advantage they have is they'll still book probably 10 or 20 X.
332
Now, 40X is better than 20X, right?
333
So they've made good coin in a situation where, as we discussed before, the $25 billion bond is going to lose money.
334
So that's proof that you can make perfectly shrewd A to C bets, sub a billion pre, and make very good money in a non-quote unquote generational company.
335
Chime is an extremely good company.
336
I agree with all that, Roy.
337
And again, I'm obviously trying to be provocative on purpose, but I think we're drugs.
338
Here's my poison point to bring it full circle to DPI, though, which is when you think about how I relatively value DPI versus TVPI or any other metric.
339
If I'm an early stage funder, really anyone, and you said, Hey, I sold my Chime stock at $25 billion for American dollars, for cash, and I gave it to you years ago, right?
340 from an IRR perspective and a cash perspective, that is a great move.
341
And so that's I think the thing that came in mind when we go back to all this is we're talking pretty deep cuts on the game of VC right now, right?
342
As opposed to the game of company building.
343
But I do think when you come back to this, this is why I believe the Chamalth line, unfortunately, and it's going to get clipped and I'm going to be upset about it, but whatever.
344
Right.
345
It's, in the end of the day, good investors, good capitalists make people money if that's the game they're playing and they're not asset gatherers.
346
In the end, it's true.
347
In the end, check in the bank counts.
348
Sometimes even, as you correctly say, it's often even true.
349
I what you said about it, basically what you said.
350
Sometimes it's even true that a smaller check earlier has more value than a bigger check later, just for a whole bunch of life reasons.
351, that's why we have interest rates.
352
There's time value of money.
353
I remember a friend of mine, we sold his company.
354
I was giving him grief.
355
And then five or six years later, another company in the same space went public at two or three times the market cap.
356
And I foolishly gave him shit about it.
357
And he called bullshit on me.
358
He said, look, I've been at the thing 10 years.
359
I made a lot of money.
360
I got married.
361
I have a life.
362
I have a lovely house in Spain.
363
And I started another company.
364
Yeah, I'd have more money if I'd held, but that was my life choice.
365
And he was exactly right.
366
I just saw Menlo Ventures.
367
So obviously, I don't know what their basis is, Rory.
368
Obviously, they'll make a ton of money on QIIME, right?
369
A classic rate bet.
370
They said they did the Series B, right?
371
They win.
372
So they did the Series B at 200, 300.
373
Maybe we can figure it out on the fly.
374
They're going to, this will be a nine.
375
There'll be some dilution.
376
They'll 10 or 15 extra money, right?
377
That'll be a fun returner or more than a fun returner, probably.
378
Not from mine.
379
Maybe a little ona, but yeah.
380
And I do that team.
381
And then back in 2021, they wanted to invest in all of my companies.
382
They're very hard, very high alignment, right?
383
For better or worse, right?
384
What's interesting to me today from the start of the conversation is all they talk about is Anthropic today.
385
And this is a smart team.
386
It's every they have an Anthropic fund every because I follow all the guys and I'm linked in nothing but their series.
387
They didn't do the seed and they're going to make a lot of money off this, right?
388
Because Anthropic is one to three billion in revenue in five months, right?
389
But it's a sign of the times, isn't it?
390
Probably.
391
I don't see them trumpeting their coming DPI from QIIME, which is epic, but Anthropic is on their social media 17 times a day, as perhaps it should be.
392
But there's no, I don't think they're taking any DPI.
393
We're not talking to entrepreneurs.
394
They're not marketing to LPs.
395
Here's the way I look at it, honestly.
396
I think in venture capital, it is unbelievably difficult to know what anything is worth.
397
And if you're Menlo or you're anyone in the middle, my God, you have to price things properly.
398
If you're plowing enormous amounts of money and something late on the Infinity Dream, prices really matter, which is how you get these ridiculous prices.
399
And the reason is very simple.
400
It's, what is OpenAI worth?
401
Who the hell knows?
402
It's one of those things where people can dream, right?
403
You can have a trillion-dollar dream, and that means that there's very little pricing discipline.
404
It's basically a game of pissing of who can pay more or who's willing to go further.
405
And at seed, nothing's worth anything, right?
406
And so you just have to have pricing discipline and remember that.
407
The problem with Menlo is that I don't know how.
408
I said this to someone who started my career at a gaming company.
409
I think with these private companies, catching the right price and the right dynamic and being right at Series AB is the hardest game.
410
I think some parts of that are true.
411
I think you are right that the seed investor.
412, I always say,, we tend to do A's and B's.
413
And I always say we're at the first point where you can start to do some analysis versus just people and market, which is what you have to live on on broad directionality, right?
414
You've got at least some pitiful facts to look at and try to protect.
415
I have no facts.
416
I exist in a fact-free zone.
417
Yeah, yes, absolutely.
418
And we live in a fact-thin zone.
419
So I do agree.
420
I don't agree that pricing for us is quote harder than pricing for the late stage.
421
I think late stage, on average, I think it's much harder to price at that late stage because on average, you'll be wrong.
422
And we're seeing a whole bunch of down rounds where the last round loses money and every other round prior to that makes money.
423
So I think price discipline is even more important the closer you get to an angle.
424
So they don't lose money.
425
They just get their pressure.
426
Well, we've trashed that one to that.
427
In China's case, they're going to lose money because they don't have a fair eye roll.
428
But I think the more important thing is, the interesting is we always say, and I think entropic, by the way, I think men are doing anthropic was a genius move, right?
429
So come to that in a second.
430
I think it's a genius move too.
431
Totally.
432
I think there's always some deals, and it's very surprising that even at that two, three, five billion valuation level, there's still another 10x from there.
433
Now, there's not many of them.
434
There's literally one maybe every second year.
435
But if you do that one, you can price it's an A or a B, but deploy money it's an F and make a return,, 10X plus return as if it's an A or B.
436
It's an awesome deal.
437
As I say, one of them every couple of years.
438
Andropic was one, OpenAI was one, probably Andrew was one.
439
But the average late-stage deal isn't that, right?
440
And there's just less degrees of freedom on the average late-stage deal to compound.
441
So I think you have to be a little, when I look at the people who do it well, the Meritex, the IVP, there's a fair amount of shrewd price discipline in what they bring to the channel.
442
Or what the product they're selling is,, just a different product.
443
The product they're selling is access to this pool of companies that are late for people with too much money or that need private access with a cherry on top of infinity, right?
444
And they're not in the business.
445
I think that's probably not as true for the names I cited, but I think you're right, Sam.
446
There are people who are, there are funds who are playing that game where,, it gets back to the whole, when all the cute, sexy stuff is private, there are eventually going to be entities whose sole goal in life is to put public investors in contact with those sexy private companies.
447
The one thing I will say on QIIME and the 25 billion is every single round in the billions for Revolut, everyone was saying, well, how much more can it be?
448
How much more can it be?
449
I think everyone is realizing now that Revolut will quite likely be at least a $100 billion company and likely $150 billion.
450
If you sold at $25, you would be grossly underestimating missing $125 billion of gains in a European neobank.
451
But it also just depends what business you think you're in.
452
Aren't you in the business of making as much money for your investors as possible?
453
No, there's another real debate, I think, which is a tough one, which is I would argue that there's a strong case to be made that as a venture capitalist, you should not have an opinion about the public markets.
454
That you're not paid to have an opinion about public markets.
455
People have their own opinions about public markets.
456
And you're paid, your job is to manage the private markets or private pricing.
457
And once something's public, it's, look, the game should be over.
458
Now, there's all sorts of people that juice that or decide they do have opinions about the public markets.
459
But I don't know.
460
It's something I've gone back and forth on, to be totally honest with you, about whether VC is just thematically shooting that, or whether you say, Look,, we can turn over shares.
461
You guys figure out what to do.
462
But I would probably sell Revolut and Chime right now.
463
Right now.
464
Both of them have about 150% market share.
465
True TAM.
466
If you're trying to decide when to sell, right, or whether they have Infinity Runway, market share is a limiter, right?
467
There are folks that can get to 100% market share, but for a lot of apps, 15% I find is a little bit of headwind.
468 you start to see, and a lot of times in B2B, when the market's smaller, it's even before $100 million in revenue.
469
You start to get to double-digit market share, and just when it gets good, because everyone's heard about you, and all the leads come in, it's, ah, all the easy 15% market share is a lot.
470
If it's not a monopoly, if it's not a monopoly, that is the classic thing.
471
Everyone comes,, as an early editor, people come to me,, well, the CAC is blank, but it's going to go down.
472
I'm, nope, CAC only goes up, right?
473, people just consistently get this wrong, right?
474
And so I think it's almost always up at scale, right?
475
It's, this is how the world works.
476
I'm,, the argument that you're going to get good at something and all of a sudden it's going to get cheaper is just wrong.
477
So is Chime an important company?
478
I just don't see it.
479, it's a good company.
480, they provided some banking products to unbanked people or underbanked people.
481
I get it.
482
It's not bad.
483
They did a good job.
484
They built a good app.
485
But is it important?
486
If the $14 billion market cap was in my bank account, I would think it was a very important company indeed.
487
It's fine.
488
It's fine.
489
It's not a bad thing, right?
490
It's just.
491
If that is the case, if QIIME is not an important company at all, then I've never done anything important in my life.
492
I've been a decent founder.
493
I've seeded multiple companies.
494
My team has gone on to help run multiple DeggaCorns.
495
I've had $5 billion cash exits, but I really don't matter.
496
I think I've helped thousands of founders build companies from scratch, but I probably don't matter if Chime doesn't matter.
497
I think the default is that most of us don't matter, and most of the companies in the world don't matter.
498
But the things that matter really matter, right?
499
And I think the job is to find the things that really matter.
500
Do you think Salesforce or Oracle matters?
501
Arthur Balfour, Prime Minister of England, in the 1900s, a very languid, relaxed man, used to say, Nothing matters a lot and very little matters at all.
502
And that's really what you're saying, Sam.
503
And it's true, but the cost of correct response is, what am I meant to do with that?
504
I think an Andrew can matter.
505
I think the Intel Story, it can.
506
I'm not saying it will.
507
I do think killing people matters.
508
It's very difficult.
509
I think that OpenAI could matter.
510
Microsoft, Facebook, Google, these are companies that matter.
511
I think Bitcoin matters.
512
I personally think Solana matters.
513
I think Venmo might matter.
514
We can go down the line of things that are paradigm shifting and have an impact.
515
And then everything else is not you can't build good businesses.
516
You can.
517
So you're not sure OpenAI will matter.
518
You just think it's possible.
519
I'm not sure it will matter.
520
I think it might matter.
521, that's a pretty arrogant thing to say, isn't it?
522
Why?
523
The game is young.
524
They clearly pushed the ball forward, but will we look back in 20 years and say OpenAI was a fundamentally important company?
525
Maybe.
526
I think the truth is most companies fail.
527
Some companies compound to a billion in value.
528
A few each year compound to 5 billion.
529
One every year to 10 and one or two every decade to 100 billion.
530
So taking away that quote matter, and I think market cap is a rough proxy for mattering.
531
I say that pretty confidently because I believe the capital system works and the things that matter the most are valued the most.
532
What I'm disconnecting with a little bit is, and so I love what Jason said.
533
I just want to come back to, I love what he said.
534
I'm at peace with the fact that if the definition of mattering is $100 billion, I may well complete another 10 years in venture, do it for 40 years, and quote, never matter.
535
And I'm okay with that.
536, I'll take it up to my therapist.
537
I'll be fine.
538
But I know I'll have invested in perfectly good companies that have built real value, that create perfectly good businesses that,, in some cases are worth $5, $10 billion.
539
And that's okay.
540
The problem with the only do the things that matter is, in the end, it tends to some nihilism, which is that nothing else does matter.
541
I do think that people should wake up every day and have the opinion that they want to do things that are going to matter.
542
I'd say the most insulting thing you could ever call me is a market participant.
543
I find that an incredibly insulting.
544
You'd be, yeah, yeah, it's a pretty efficient market.
545
Capitalism is pretty efficient.
546
You pay $150 billion, $120 million.
547
Who cares?
548, it's fine.
549
You have a company that's a billion-dollar company that does some stuff.
550
Fine.
551
I'm glad that happened.
552
That's capitalism working.
553
But then you're really just a cog in the system, right?
554
And I think that's not a recipe for outsized returns, but it is a recipe for doing fine.
555
It's just not my goal.
556
I am a cog in the system.
557
I might want to be more than that, but I think you're a hollowed out thumb that doesn't matter.
558
Harry, you should have asked Aaron Levy when you interviewed him yesterday if he mattered.
559
Yeah, I don't think he matters.
560
I don't think Box, I don't think he matters.
561, he has to do that.
562
Aaron Levy.
563
Oh, Box, I love Aaron.
564
It's nowhere near open.
565
I don't think Aaron Levy would say Box is more important than OpenAI.
566
I'm confident he would.
567
For what it's worth, I love Aaron.
568
He's a great company.
569
His company doesn't matter.
570
It's only four, five, six billion.
571
It's irrelevant.
572
I completely agree.
573
His company doesn't matter.
574
And in fact, one of the things I told him when I went public is that.
575
Should he just shut it down tomorrow?
576
It's $5.5 billion company.
577
Absolutely not, but it does matter.
578
It's a big fee for some random person to come run it from some hedge fund.
579
Aaron is very excited about AI, if you didn't know, right?
580
And I think part of that is an opportunity for him and for Box to matter, right?
581
Because Box is, again, he's done an incredible job.
582
I'm very pro Aaron Levy.
583
And what I said to him when the company went public, I said, Look, one of the things I most respect about you is you just worked this to make it happen, right?
584, this was not from a first principles, an important company, right?
585
This is not a sexy company, but you just ground it out.
586
And, I really respect that.
587
I'm, I think that's an incredible thing to have done.
588
But I think part of the excitement about a lot of founders.
589
But he's wasting his life.
590, Aaron and I started together, so he was 20.
591
This company doesn't matter.
592
When he started, he was a wonder kid.
593
Now he's the grayest CEO I know.
594
He's wasted his whole fucking life, is basically what you're saying, because it doesn't matter.
595
Wasted his life.
596
Rory was there.
597
He could have sold his company to Citrix and made $100 million with retention payments in 2008.
598
So he wasted the last, according to you, he wasted the last 16 years of his life.
599
Fucking threw it, flushed it down the toilet by doing a bigger piece of money.
600
He made less money at the IPO.
601
He flushed it down the toilet.
602
But look, I do think there's this thing going on right now.
603
He wasted his life in Citrix.
604
Wasted his fucking life, the poor.
605
For what it's worth, I think, A, I don't know.
606
I think you probably know the math, but my sense is that he probably would have made more in that deal than ultimately going public.
607
And I don't know where he is now, but from that.
608
Cash in 2008 plus his shares in Stripe and Gusto and others.
609
Yeah, he should have just, he should have just found it in Allbirds instead of doing box.
610
If he were a fund manager, he definitely should have sold then.
611
He's not.
612
He's a person and he wants to run it.
613
That's fine.
614
The second thing I say is, I do think there's a lot of exuberance about AI right now from a lot of people who are in these positions.
615, this is a company that's been meh, but maybe there's an angle to not be meh, right?
616
And that's exciting to people.
617, I think that's awesome for Org to try that.
618
But I think it is the race to matter that becomes interesting.
619
And that's why I think the AI stuff is so interesting in so many cases.
620
Is some of it's real, some of it's not.
621
But, there is this new opening where people are, oh my God, does this now matter?
622
That's the big game to play.
623
Anyway, guys, with that, I'm holding up my partner meeting.
624
So I'm going to drop.
625
But that was fun.
626
I hope I have my therapy session set up for tomorrow.
627
I don't matter.
628
I'm hollowed out, but I'll get through it somehow.
629
I'm sure you will.
630
As my wife says, sometimes go get some all birds, Rory.
631
You'll feel better.
632
Go to the mall at Stanford and get a few pair of all birds and you'll feel a winner.
633
Cry into your bucket of money.
634
Okay.
635
The thing that I do want to go to, though, now is, I thought a phenomenal report, which Jason, you did brilliant work on, which was Mary Meeker's AI report.
636
So I want to go to it, though.
637
You posted an incredible thread with 10 fantastic takeaways.
638
I want to hand over to you on which takeaways you found most striking and why, and just start there.
639
Some of it was obvious.
640
The one I first started off, which is obvious, but I'll tell you why I put it in there anyway, was that ChatGPT is the fastest, even though Sam Lesson said he's not sure it's important.
641
It's the fastest gain of users in the history of the world.
642
0 to 800 million in 17 months.
643
Okay.
644
It took Netflix 15 times longer.
645
It took TikTok five times longer.
646
The rate of adoption.
647
I talked to so many folks, especially in B2B here.
648
They're,, I don't know.
649
I don't know that AI can really replace a good hardworking marketing manager or a good PR person.
650
Or they say there's too many, what they say, Rory?
651
There's too many hallucinations.
652
To me, it was a reminder: the rate of change.
653
I don't think as humans, we can process the rate of change of AI.
654
It's so fast that we don't understand almost how quickly it's changing.
655
Whatever you think AI could do three months ago, it's super dated.
656
The second Mary Meeker one was showing that the infrastructure spend is unprecedented in the history of internet, right?
657
That the big six spent $212 billion on CapEx.
658
And yeah, the top line's great, but the spend here is insane.
659
I'm just still a little confused where it's going because it's early at the application level.
660
At the application level, is this all going to coding and support?
661
Is it all going to custom data analysis?
662
Is it all going to subsidizing our chat GPT, 20 bucks a month?
663
I just don't know where all this infrastructure, I think it's laying a foundation that is transformational, but I just, it feels so far ahead of the application level.
664
I think you're right.
665
And my takeaway from her thing was the hyperscalers have taken very good cash-efficient businesses and they would break Mr.
666
Buffett's heart because they've turned them into CapEx hogs, right?
667
Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Facebook all have had CapEx as a percentage of free cash flow go up significantly.
668
Now, as she pointed out, the good news is in the last four or five years, free cash flow themselves have grown.
669
So your cash flow hit hasn't been enormous.
670
It's only been about a 10% decline in free cash flow, right?
671
It hasn't been horrific.
672
In a less generous economic environment, the shareholders of Microsoft might well be screaming and saying, you're wow, 60 billion or nothing to show for it, guys.
673
Come on here.
674
It's been perfect timing.
675
It's a little in that respect, 98, 99.
676
The overall economy has been favorable.
677
The performance of the hyperscalers' existing businesses, not their AI businesses, have been pretty damn amazing.
678
And as a result of that, the market's been able to say, guys, knock yourself out, spend $260 billion.
679, I'm sure something will come of it soon.
680
The $600 billion question is, where are the apps?
681
And since then, it implied, though, didn't say, oh, my God, there's going to be a correction.
682
And obviously, since then, there hasn't been, right?
683
Everyone is just plowing on.
684
They're investing the capital and the revenue is coming.
685
But relative to the spend, if someone said to you, you can finance a $600 billion CapEx business, four or five years in, you'd have $10, $15 million billion in revenue and $585 billion in losses, you'd probably say, ah, no, I don't need that right now.
686
But that's where we're at.
687
We say that on the revenue side, but then,, I think end of year next year, OpenAI is going to be at 25 to 30 billion.
688
We saw Anthropic cross 3 billion in revenue up from a billion just five months ago, 3x from a billion in five months.
689
It always takes time when we're laying infrastructure.
690
Revenue comes later.
691
The variable that we're missing in this discussion, in my view, is time.
692
I totally believe that all the apps will come to fill the space available for it with all this CapEx.
693
I believe the LLM guys will make amazing shit.
694
It'll be impressive and businesses will find a way to use it.
695
But to Jason's point, I think if businesses adopt in two years and then the revenue comes quickly, it'll all be fine.
696
If businesses take four or five years to get there, you could be looking at a more extended period of,, you're having the costs, but not yet the revenues.
697
I think that's the as yet unknown.
698
How quickly will apps revenue fill the gap?
699
When you look at percent of free cash flow, you said they're 10% and investors being okay with that.
700
There's a ceiling to what they are okay with.
701
If it is five years out and that is now 30, 40, is there a ceiling to what investors are okay with?
702
Satya, Larry, Sergei, you name it, spending?
703
Yes, there is, is the answer.
704
And it seems inconceivable today because everyone's, wow, wow, go for it.
705
But,, public company investors are just mean VCs on steroids.
706
We turn on a dime from, I can't believe you're not spending more, to what the frick do you mean you're spending so much money?
707
And we've lived to it in 99 where,, you'd call the team in and say double the burn.
708
And without blushing, you'd call them in six months later and say, why are you spending so much money?
709
Let's cut.
710
If the economy slows down, if your core growth rate starts to decline or slow down significantly, I think you'd see mild to reasonable level pressure on all the hyperscalers an interesting example would be in a different market meta changed its name and wanted to go all in on vr they're two years in there's no return there was a little bit of pressure and i think zuckerberg heard the pressure and pivoted nicely too still spending a lot on virtual reality but not as much and there was a little bit of a belt tightening there so when the pressure comes on i think yeah i think ceos respond i said this when we chatted last time that if you really one of the things i admire about saw maltman some things i don't understand about admirer is how he's telling you the future even though you if you just got to listen yeah And when he started talking about stargate that he alone needed 500 billion just to get going and up to five trillion dollars right we got him all what stargate what do you mean 500 billion but he's socializing the whole market that it's going to be an order of magnitude bigger right he's socializing the market here this isn't amazon not only is the size bigger than the classic amazon investment losses but you need everyone to go all in on this you need all the big participants to say we're going all in on this on this big bet it's not just one company making it making a big bet this is all the big companies making a massive bet i think the interesting question is there was a time when amazon stock was perilously low and a whole bunch of banking analysts were sneering and saying they'll go bust and obviously in retrospect they didn't and all those banks did and jeff bezas got to say nino nino but intuitively you just know when you're spending half a trillion dollars in advance of revenue at some point in the next two or three years there'll be at least one scary moment.
711
And that could be an interesting opportunity to invest, but it's hard to believe it's popping to the right from here.
712
What is a scary moment?
713
Can you just help me visualize that?
714
When we see the commoditization of models, they're all becoming very efficient.
715
They're all becoming really bloody good.
716
What is a scary moment?
717
Maybe if OpenAI just misses a growth plan, right?
718
If it's just 30 or 40%, if they have two rough quarters for whatever reason, right?
719
Some saturation we're not anticipating.
720
That would set off a mini panic, I think.
721
Agreed.
722
And,, I was just looking at their numbers.
723
It's interesting, exactly 20 years apart.
724
Their numbers versus Google's numbers from 20 years ago.
725
So literally, 2002 is the same as OpenAI as 2022.
726
2003, I think I'm doing it from memory, about 1.3 billion for OpenAI, 1.4 billion for Google four years ago, 20 years ago.
727
This year, 2004, sorry, 3 billion and 3 billion.
728
So roughly the same.
729
And now what's interesting is the projections for OpenAI now start to, as yet unrealized projections, start to pull way ahead of Google.
730
In other words, OpenAI will, it was the Google of its day until now and is projecting to become twice the Google of its day for the next four years.
731
Now, maybe it will, because I think it is a more impressive piece of technology when you use it, but maybe it won't.
732
Let me make the statement clear.
733
If all OpenAI is, is just as good as Google, then it's going to miss its number next year by about 40%.
734
That would be a scary moment.
735
I'm simply saying that the expectations are so high that anything less than freaking amazing could feel a fail, even though in any logical terms it isn't.
736
Just as Amazon wasn't a fail in 2001, 2002, it was just, in retrospect, minor growing pains that a panicky market interpreted in, oh my god, they're going to bust.
737
No, they're just building a business where it's going to take three to four billion dollars of losses to get the cash flow break even.
738
And then you're going to make billions every year.
739
Jason, just to be clear, we're going to do a visual of Rory looking mean with open AI.
740
Doesn't matter.
741
No one else in the frame.
742
No one else in the frame.
743
Touch a dick with your captions, Harry.
744
I just want to say that, and you get me into trouble.
745
I've given up.
746
You got to do it.
747
You want to do the third point?
748
Because it's interesting that I brought up.
749
Keep going.
750
No, keep going.
751
You could have opinions on Elon Musk, right?
752
But now that he's out of government, man, the guy is direct, right?
753
He was direct today.
754
He said this spending bill is ridiculous for all parties.
755
And he has been talking about China with AI, right?
756
America's number three point was, we're missing what's happening in China, which is natural.
757
We're not even connected to them on the internet.
758
We have different internet.
759
Her point was: it was X months ago we thought DeepSeek was going to change the world.
760
It didn't.
761
But 93% performance at the time of Open AI's 03 Mini for a fraction of the cost.
762
Alibaba, which we can't even use here, right?
763
Outperforms both.
764
Baidu Ernie, which I don't even know, 0.2% the cost of GPT 4.5.
765
People smarter than me are worried about China and AI.
766
That was her third point.
767
And we've stopped talking about safety, and I think we've stopped talking about China.
768, the simpler point is probably some version of, I think, ChatGPT will be the Apple-level quality product, but there'll be a whole bunch of Android-type quality products that are out there that will just keep pricing honest if they're commercially available universally.
769
And I don't think, to Jason, to your point, obviously, if the models are built in China, we won't be accessing them here, even if we will legally loud.
770
My guess is corporate America wouldn't want to.
771
The meta point about DeepSeek was that it was possible to get quite close, quite cheaply.
772
And,, you're going to see that independent of China just in terms of competition here.
773
But I think the undeniable fact is we ain't a monopoly anymore.
774
It's not two or three companies monopolistically producing LLMs.
775
There are four or five companies the other side of the pond cranking them out.
776
Jason, were there any others that you think were specifically relevant for B2B?
777
Maybe just two more, and you can shut me up.
778
The second one, which we all know, but I think it's very useful to see it simplified and compressed into a chart, which is folks still get this wrong on B2B today.
779
Token costs collapse 99.7% in two years.
780
Now, if you're a developer, if you're sitting in Windsurf or Lovable all day, you get this, and it's not this simple because you're consuming many more tokens, right?
781
But all these ill-fitting blazer and jeans SaaS guys who are saying it's too expensive, or the mediocre and VP of engineering that don't code anymore, who haven't coded in five years, that are constantly telling me why AI is too expensive and don't work, find a new job, right?
782
If tokens collapse 99% 0.7% in the next two years, you can tell me, Rory, but I don't know where they're going to be in two years, but it's at least going to be an exponential decrease in absolute cost per token, right?
783
We'll use more, right?
784
Training costs will go up.
785
But even today, in June, if I want to just jump off the roof, when I hear a VP of engineering that doesn't code anymore saying it's too expensive to do enough AI in the product, we'd to do this, Rory, at our B2B workflow company, but we can't.
786
It's too expensive, Mr.
787
Board of Director.
788, I just want to tell, I tell the CEO to fire that guy.
789
Yeah, you should pummel him to debt.
790
You're entirely right.
791
Because there's some things I'm angsty about in terms of the road ahead, in terms of the economics of it.
792
But just from a raw knowledge, intelligence, for lack of a better word, is just going to get cheaper and cheaper, faster and faster.
793
Intelligence is available at a price that's declining,, by long orders of magnitude every freaking year.
794
That's just huge.
795
As I say, one of my boards, where I've a wildly smart call in a core AI model as a fellow board member, it just repeats over and again.
796
So you can't do it today.
797
Build the product.
798
By the time you've built it, the stuff will be cheaper.
799
It'll work.
800
And if it doesn't work, then it'll work six months from now.
801
That's the big trend that you're all leaning into.
802
The price of a unit of intelligence is plummeting every month.
803
Therefore, anything that you can throw intelligence at will get cheaper every month.
804
Just lean into it, and the models will make it happen.
805
I call it the AI slow roll, and I think it's the number one thing killing B2B companies is the AI slow roll.
806
Yes.
807
We're talking about it.
808
We're going to roll something out in Q4.
809
We're going to do a limited release in Q4, Rory.
810
And then next year, if it goes well, we're going to roll it out to a little bit more of our base.
811
We're just going to be slaughtered.
812
That's a fun discussion because it is so hard to watch companies turn on a dime and push towards the new thing.
813
And we're talking when Sam was on early.
814
I give Aaron huge credit.
815
He's, we're going to do this.
816
It's going to be top-down.
817
Quintessential example is Facebook just after the IPO this year deciding mobile is it.
818
Strap ourselves into the office.
819
We're just going to get it done.
820
And it takes top-down leadership.
821
And I agree, if you don't do that, and if you don't do it well, you're just going to be slow toast over the next two years.
822
And it's just hard to do.
823
It's just hard to shake companies out of their inertia because you'll always feel that doing a little means at least you're trying.
824
So that gives you points.
825
That's the problem with startups.
826
They're thinking they get points for doing a little, right?
827
Here.
828
Yeah.
829
I thought it was fantastic.
830
I had Varun, the founder of Windsurf, on the show, released on Monday.
831
And he said, listen, startups beat incumbents because of existential dread.
832
If you are in a startup and you don't ship great product and it converts to sales, you lose.
833
If you are in an incumbent and you don't ship great product, it converts, and you're a great engineer, you're definitely getting reassigned and reallocated.
834
You're not going to lose great engineers.
835
You're just going to put them on different products.
836
See, it will be.
837, that's the problem with B2B today versus where Varun is.
838
I don't see enough existential dread in most B2B startups.
839
I don't see it.
840
Aaron has it.
841
Yamini had it when she was on stage.
842
Aaron and Yamini at SASTR this year.
843, Rory Sales Investor both, they both said the same thing.
844
We're so excited and we're scared.
845
I don't see enough existential dread in B2B startups.
846
I don't see it.
847
I see a little bit of it, some discussion.
848
I want to walk into a board meeting and see a little bit of shaking because there's so much going on in the world.
849
And they just had yet another hackathon this last weekend, and they're rolling out AI voice agents on Wednesday.
850
If that's not you, I honestly think you're going to fail.
851
You want dread.
852
Veroon's right because Varun, he's had three different companies in 18 months, right?
853
And every month he's at risk of being displaced.
854
Every month, right?
855
And he's honest about it.
856
He was honest on 20 BC, right?
857
We need more of that in B2B, not this slow roll.
858
So the other point she made, which we knew if you want, but I really think for B2B, this is super interesting because a lot of stuff she said, pricing, but this is one to slow down on.
859
And Harry sometimes jokes that he's old, but this is where Harry is old, for real.
860
Her point was the next 32% of the world is just coming online right now.
861
They will all be AI first.
862
She says they'll use voice agents, agent-driven interfaces, and national language interactions.
863
I think that is 22025.
864
What I do know is that this generation will not use the internet remotely we do.
865
They will not use lead contacts and opportunities.
866
They will not use files.
867
Files are disappearing overnight.
868
Kids do not know what a file is.
869
It does not matter.
870
Everything will be MCP'd or AI'd.
871
And this is an existential threat.
872 if I'm Aaron or Yamini, these are S-tier Sassios.
873
I got to worry about AI today, right?
874
I got to worry about agents.
875
I got to worry about automation.
876
And then I got to worry about what happens when no one uses these applications remotely they use them today.
877
You really think that the next generation is going to even understand what a Salesforce UI is?
878
It won't even make sense to them.
879
They'll never use it.
880
My son helped us at SAS Ranio this year.
881
We have a SAS platform we use for tickets and stuff.
882
And he's, wow, this is the first time I've seen software this.
883
Wow.
884
And he codes every day.
885
I do think that is true.
886
I think in front of every system of record, there's going to be some system of work that does it.
887
And it'll sit on top of the system of record for now.
888
And if it does a good job, it will gradually displace, make irrelevant, or replace the system of record if they allow that to happen.
889
The AI that's closest to you as the worker, if I'm the worker, if the thing that I interact with every day that helps me do my job, over time, that just becomes the most important thing in my life.
890
And anything back behind that doesn't matter.
891
So if I'm a sales rep and I have a lot of automation, voice automation, AI, SDR, whatever, telling me what to do, doing things for me, where I'm acting as a controller of the agents, that's just going to become mentally my model of what a CRM is.
892
And back behind that, yeah, there might be some database called Salesforce, but I just won't care.
893
Yeah, and there might even be multiple ones.
894
You won't care.
895
You won't care if the company is using Salesforce and HubSpot and Adio and its own database.
896
No, I think smart companies can reimagine what those workflows look and built to it.
897
And that's obviously what they're trying to do.
898
But if you fail, if you're not relevant in terms of how your next generation of workers use AI, you will eventually be displaced.
899, it might take a long time.
900
I think, as I've always said, I think Salesforce instances will be there at scale long after I'm dead.
901
But the value accretion will all go to the technology that's helping me do my job, not the technology that's count keeping score on how well my job's been done.
902
The one I'm really struggling with today, and I have asked Aaron and others this, right?
903
It's early, but I think MCP is an existential threat to almost every SaaS app.
904
And now you can MCP into Notion.
905
You can MCP a little bit into HubSpot, but it's very limited, right?
906
You can MCP into Google Calendar.
907
I just don't know why if I can just talk to my AI, my cloud or chat GP, and do everything I want to do at HubSpot elegantly, I don't know why I would ever log into HubSpot or ever even learn what HubSpot is.
908
That's Hatch's perspective, though, isn't it, really?
909
Which is that,, in an Agentic-first world or an agent-first world, you basically have all of these applications that become databases, and then agents basically become the data transporters, and you never need to engage with the core database.
910
I thought it was too nerdy when he started saying it, right?
911
And too technical, too Microsoft-y.
912
I thought it was too Microsoft-y.
913
But time goes by, and now that I can see MCP applications just starting.
914
And the problem today is you need to, listen, I'm not an expert, but everything I've tried, you need a key.
915
So a key is annoying, right?
916
I got to go to some website.
917
I got to get a secret key, and I got to add it to my thing.
918
But when those keys go away, and I can just talk to all my apps through my Chat GPT or Claude, man, I just don't think we're ready for this world.
919
And I'll give you a personal example.
920, Harry knows there's a company I invested in that I love called Mango Mint.
921
It's next generation SaaS for spas, doctors' offices, and the.
922
Okay, they're coming up on 25 million.
923
Love the CO to death, would do anything with them.
924
He was all over MCP the day he could use it.
925
Okay.
926
And he's, here's the problem for me.
927
Let me be clear.
928
And he's the best in his space.
929
That's why they were able to do it.
930
Not a huge TAM, lots of issues.
931, now, let's say I want an appointment at Watercourse Way in Palo Alto, right?
932
Where Rory goes to decompress after a tough pod.
933
Tell me.
934
But right now, he might have to figure out which application they use.
935
Do they use Mango Mint?
936
Do they, which of the variants, what do they use?
937
MCP, it can just abstract away and you'll have no more relationship with his application.
938
And, he's, I could become a pipe overnight.
939
And he's already completely changed his value proposition because of that.
940
Because it's, if I don't change what I'm doing today, no one will even know which of these applications.
941
And Harry's invested in some adjacent companies, not in this space.
942
But you might not know.
943
You might not know which restaurant application it is, which spa application.
944
It might not matter.
945
It's very difficult for me to imagine you can increase your prices in that world.
946
Maybe you can increase your prices.
947
I can tell you one thing, dude.
948
If you're doing SaaS for spas, you definitely don't matter according to Sam.
949
That's it.
950
No, no, no, no, no.
951
I wouldn't even.
952
Restaurants, you are just not even in the conversation, dude.
953
We're both doctors' offices, spas.
954
But he was, in a good way, it was an instant wake-up call.
955
He's, if I don't address, if I don't add even more value, I will be partially obsolete because people won't even know who I am anymore.
956
They'll just use AI to just go out and pick it for them.
957
And anytime anyone starts talking about agentic this and that, I start to roll my eyes.
958
It's too nerdy.
959
The real world doesn't think about agentic this, but the rural world does think, can I go to ChatGPT and get my haircut?
960, Rory's upgraded his haircut for the show.
961
It looks good, right?
962
Thank you.
963
But why can't my ChatGPT just figure out where's the best haircut in the mid-peninsula and do it for me?
964
Why do I have to do these apps?
965
The closer you are to what the customer or the user wants to do, the more right you have to swallow anything that's behind that.
966
And that's really what you're saying.
967
Do you want to be the person who keeps track of who's coming to the spa?
968
Or do you want to be the software that helps decide who's coming to the spa?
969
I want to be the decider.
970
I don't want to be the tracker.
971
Because tracking on its own is inherently just not as valuable as a thing to bring to market.
972
The long-term trend is clear here.
973
It's very interesting that Darmesh is on the bleeding edge of this for HubSpot.
974
And I think HubSpot is threatened by MCP.
975, HubSpot is a system of record, too.
976
It's a very valuable one.
977
And does HubSpot really want everybody abstracting away all their structured data and using it however they want in their own applications and their own CRMs and their own marketing applications?
978
The incumbents will last a long time, but that doesn't matter because what matters to us is where the next new dollar goes.
979
We're all about the next 100 million of new ARR coming on.
980
And it's hard, and that could comfortably go to these next generation products.
981
While at the same time, SAP can compound for the next decade happily, but they won't be getting the new money.
982
Our job is to find the companies that get the new dollar.
983
And you don't have to have a world.
984
One of the big ahas for me has been: quote-unquote, last generation companies can compound happily for years on their existing base, on expanding within those customers, while at the same time, effectively, you're signing new customers who are saying that that old thing is not where the world is going anymore, but it just has such momentum, it just keeps on compounding.
985
But that's okay for that as a public company.
986
For you, as a venture investor, trying to find the new, new thing, it's all about the much smaller dollars in budgets that are available for the new stuff because that's the only money we can live off.
987
We can't take the SAP budget for our new product for the next 10 years.
988
We got to take the new companies or the new functionality that sits on top of those apps, be it SAP, Salesforce, Oracle, et cetera.
989
And it's hard to imagine in 2025, knowing what we do about AI, to say, I've been thinking we really should build a screen just the other SAP screens.
990
That's not where it's going to go.
991
Every company's market share is up for grabs when there's a platform shift.
992
The very biggest ones don't go to zero, they just slow down.
993
But you're right, the mid-tier ones can really hit a wall.
994
And if you're running one of these companies and you're not afraid and you're not 110% focused, you're almost certainly going to fail.
995
And the only question is over what period of time.
996
Turns out making money is hard.
997
Keeping money is harder.
998
Guys, can I just roll to one thing we said about not being a public markets investor?
999
Everyone loves the analysis we do on your chimes of the world that we have done in the past.
1000
There have been a lot coming out in terms of MAs and IPOs.
1001
There's QIIME, obviously, this week.
1002
There's Grove filed for an IPO.
1003
It's an Indian IPO.
1004
Shein moving IPO from London to Hong Kong, maybe finally getting that one out.
1005
Amada Health coming out for a $1.1 billion price.
1006
Circle files for IPO at $8 billion.
1007
Salesforce acquires Informatica at $8 billion.
1008
Of those, free-for-all, which one do you think is most interesting?
1009
I'll hit two.
1010
I do think Circle is interesting just because it's a fun business model.
1011
Basically, it's a Bitcoin-enabled money market fund.
1012
And they get your money.
1013
They're able to invest it in treasuries.
1014
They get a nice yield.
1015
They have to share some of that money with customers, with distribution partners, and they build a perfectly nice business there, right?
1016
And valuation at around 18 plus or minus reasonable.
1017
It's an interesting business.
1018
It's a $43, $44 billion money market fund where they're getting roughly 4% or 5%.
1019
So just under $2 billion in revenue.
1020
And then they have to share a lot of that with distribution partners.
1021
And they have a net interest margin.
1022
It's just a little mini bank type thing.
1023
And then they have OpEx and they make a couple hundred million bucks a year.
1024
Perfectly good business.
1025
It's the boring version of crypto.
1026
Crypto, but safe.
1027
I think it'll be an interesting IPO.
1028
Yeah, I think it's bounded in terms of value because there's no magic explosion thing.
1029
It's very clear how the model works.
1030
Anyone financial can figure it out and value it.
1031
But I think it's interesting.
1032
To me, that was the most interesting, although I'm still trying to fully understand it, was that Snowflake bought probably an almost pre-revenue startup called Crunchy Data, which is a Postgres implementation right after Databricks bought its own Postgres database company, Neon, for a billion.
1033
I assumed Neon had some real revenue, right?
1034
$250 million for Snowflake suggests to me they're buying some distribution.
1035
But the fact that trying to understand to this conversation how AI shifts the battles, that Snowflake and Databricks now need to be database companies to some level in a year or two could be fundamental change and all these lines blurring.
1036
Instead of Snowflake figuring out how to work with all these different Postgres providers and open sourced and forked versions and all the different databases, now they're database companies.
1037
Yes, they need their own custom databases so their agents can efficiently work on all the data that's been laked and stored here.
1038
But pretty interesting within 60 days, including one yesterday, they both became database companies.
1039
It's a big change.
1040
What it really is, is feeling the need to support all the different types of data structures.
1041
And as you said, morphing from a world where the typical Snowflakes data with data warehouse type data to now the data used for AI.
1042
So feeling the need to support a wider variety of data types and data structures.
1043
Yeah, those are the two.
1044
I nearly said, isn't it funny?
1045
I nearly said those are the two publicly traded companies.
1046
And then I remember Databricks isn't publicly traded.
1047
It's just as if it was a public company.
1048
And it should be, of course, and it will be.
1049
But you've got Snowflake as public, you've got Databricks.
1050
And then, Harry, you're going to ask about it in a second, but companies Clickhouse, which are an exploding company in the database space, Collino Database, that's really seeing explosive growth and just raise a big late stage round, I think around $6 billion from a host of who's who.
1051
The AI plumbing business is a great place to be, right?
1052
And if you're even adjacent to it, I would argue five or six years ago, Snowflake wasn't in it.
1053
They were adjacent to it.
1054
So they're trying to fearlessly move into it.
1055
I think the Databricks advantage was they were in it from the start.
1056
It was their thing, moving data and then ultimately,, using moving data, which enabled for AI.
1057
So venture guys make really good thematic bets about the next 10 years and are pretty horrible at assessing how the market's going to react to the next quarter's data.
1058
Hedge fund guys are the exact opposite.
1059
They literally, some of them,, the overnight traders don't even want to think about the big picture trend.
1060
It's just, is this EPS number over or underestimate and will the stock go up or down?
1061
And that's just a different skill set.
1062
I'm no good at that.
1063
Proof that we're all no good at it.
1064
It's a fun thing you can do when you have a public company.
1065
You're on the board of a company.
1066
You have some interesting results.
1067
You're about to announce.
1068
Some things are better than expected.
1069
Some things are worse.
1070
I've seen this over and over again.
1071
You can go around the boardroom and ask people, here's what we said.
1072
Here's what we're going to announce tomorrow.
1073
Will the stock go up or down?
1074
At best, 50% accuracy.
1075
Oh, I've seen it over and over again.
1076
It's, hmm, we think these things are great.
1077
And then you go out and everyone gloms on to the other thing.
1078
Sometimes the stock goes down and you thought it was going up and you want to cry.
1079
Other times it goes up and you're, hmm, okay.
1080
It's two worlds talking past each other sometimes.
1081
Can I ask one more final one for a casual quick fire, which is just the YC, obviously, new batches out this week and they're raising.
1082
And everyone's doing 10% dilution for the round total.
1083
You guys are much more experienced than me.
1084
I'm very lucky to learn from you.
1085
I appreciate our relationships.
1086
Really?
1087
How do we play in a world where the total round is 10%?
1088
Our fund sizes are bigger.
1089
Really, you've got seven and a half for a lead and two and a half for angels.
1090
Jason, how would you advise me?
1091
You do YC very well.
1092
Well, first, I think at YC, it's not 20.
1093
I think the new deal they're trying to do with a lot of startups is at least 50 to 60 posts for even pre-revenue.
1094
There's a ton of deals in this batch at that level.
1095
So that's what they're pushing toward.
1096
And no criticism.
1097, you got to see YC as a business, or this stuff will drive you nuts.
1098
Have to admire the game that's being played on the field, right?
1099
Which is,, when YC went to 15, people thought it was crazy, and then 20, and now they're trying to get everyone to 50 to 60 that are AI, that just have AI, which is 70% of the batch.
1100
That's the goal.
1101
Plenty of folks raising it 50 to 60 or more with essentially no revenue.
1102
So that doesn't change the ownership question, but it does make it all even harder, right?
1103
Because then the A has to be at,, 200 for the math to really pencil out.
1104
This is what I taught investing: for seed investing to really make sense, the next round should be 3x to justify the risk.
1105
And for A or B, it's got to be 2X, or you should just wait.
1106
You should just wait for the next round.
1107
Because not that it's that simple, but intellectually it seems about right.
1108
You can either play that game and buy as much as you can, or you can cry on it on the internet.
1109
All I can tell you, my little analysis of YC is I've ended up owning about a little less than half of what I would have.
1110
That's one guy's analysis.
1111
Because I bought more, I bought more in Revenue Cat, I bought a lot more in Revenue Gat, I bought more in Algolia, I bought more in others that have done reasonably well.
1112
You can buy more in the next round, but it only works unless you have a massive fund.
1113
There's only so much you can buy in the next round, right?
1114, you run out of money, don't you?
1115
So you're going to end up owning maybe half.
1116
But Gary would tell you, since 30% of the batch is unicorns, it don't matter.
1117
Jason, first of all, I couldn't, interesting, could not agree more.
1118
I think it's what you said right at the start about they're doing their job and they're doing it well.
1119
It's one of the best businesses.
1120
Their value proposition to founders is we'll take you two unknown guys, our gals, from unknown place and we'll turn you into something that, God bless these people in Silicon Valley, they'll value at 20 to 40 to 50 million pre.
1121
And their success is a function of the more they can do that, the more people are going to want to come in, the higher quality people they're going to be able to attract.
1122
They're doing their job and they're doing it well.
1123
So you're right, bitching and moaning is a waste of time, right?
1124
All you can do is do your job well in response.
1125
And that's obviously not the stage we play at.
1126
We typically play at a round, round and a half later.
1127
But the only weapon you have on your side of the table for that, if you're going to pursue those deals, is picking.
1128
You obviously have to be way better at picking or you have to find other sources of the deals.
1129
By definition,, what's happening is as the pricing goes up, they will be correct.
1130
On the winner deals, it won't matter because it never matters on the winner deals.
1131
But,, if your advice is only do good deals, it's not really that actionable.
1132, I'm trying to only do good deals, but it's really hard in practice.
1133
The truth is when you're paying significantly more per unit, it's just a lot harder to make money.
1134
Picking has to be much more fine-grained.
1135
They've done a great job representing their side, which is the Paul Graham stated intent, make it easier to found companies.
1136
He's making it easier and more profitable and more attractive for entrepreneurs to found companies.
1137
More companies will be founded.
1138
I guess it's the same math, right?
1139
But there's plenty of ways to justify paying 60 million in a seed round, okay, if it's a generational company.
1140
What's harder, even though you can do it on a spreadsheet, if you have a fixed fund size, it's harder to take the low ownership.
1141
The low ownership crushes you, right?
1142
And so you can say, listen, this is low risk and this is the best team ever.
1143
But when you end up with 3% ownership with a large fund, that's where I think there's the slight fallacy in the YC data.
1144
And I love Gary and I love the team.
1145
But that's a model that for folks that either are angels or have tiny funds or don't need to have a fund returner or a material impact, right?
1146
It's just the math works better if it don't tie that to fund size, I think.
1147
I don't know how you do it to make return a lot of funds with 3%, though.
1148
At the end of the day, until the only thing that makes this whole process work and normalizes errors and corrects for overvaluation is ultimately returns.
1149
Correction on this issue is a lagging indicator.
1150
If these, in fact, are on average overpriced, then five or seven years from now, the people invest in them will slowly realize they've made a mistake and pricing will come down.
1151
But the weird thing about venture is it just takes a long time.
1152
It'll take 10 years to discover if the $8 billion funds work and deliver an acceptable return.
1153
It'll take eight years to figure out can you pay 60 pre for an AIY combinator startup and make money on average.
1154
Along the way, there'll be an anecdote of one company that worked.
1155
But the real test is does the overall asset class work for those prices and deals?
1156
And so far, Gary's exactly right.
1157
He cites the data.
1158
The data from the earlier batches has been obviously amazing.
1159
But,, the synagogue says, if it worked at 20 and gave you a 3x and then you pay 60, you do the math here, people.
1160, your return's going to go down by the same amount.
1161
But not for YC.
1162
And the founders get $6 million instead of $2 million.
1163
There's a lot of conceits for venture.
1164
And so many VCs are, hey, guys, take less money at a lower valuation.
1165
It's less risk.
1166
There's a VC conceit in that.
1167
One, a third the money is riskier if you don't burn it.
1168
Assuming you don't burn it, three times as much money for the same dilution de-risks your life as a founder, right?
1169
The second thing that the grouchy people miss is one of the other things that YC has quietly normalized is if you do this round next week at 60 or last week, right, at 60 post, and you have to do the next round at 20, it's okay.
1170
It's, they're all, this safes are a beautiful vehicle.
1171
Every time safes convert, there's 11,000 different prices, right?
1172
There's my best friend that invested three weeks before the batch, then there's the alumni price, then there's the price Harry paid, then there's the price Lemkin had to pay on demo day, and then there's the poor price Rory had to pay two weeks later, right?
1173
So when these notes convert at 17 prices, and then there's another set of notes at 14 other prices, nobody cares.
1174
Nobody cares that one was at 60 or one was at 20, as long as Rory gets his ownership in the Series B.
1175
Listen, guys, is there any other IPOs, anything that we've missed that we should discuss?
1176
Honestly, I think the most salient fact is that they're happening.
1177
Normal IPOs are taking place.
1178
Normal service has been resumed.
1179
I know we glossed over it in the beginning, but I do think Tom O'Bravo raising a record fund this week is a good sign, too.
1180
That's $35 billion to buy B2B companies, almost entirely B2B.
1181
Something a friend of mine used to say years ago, and it's always struck me, it's just so true.
1182
Price clears all markets.
1183
In other words, you can't get your deal done at 25, which is the price you paid billion, which is the price you paid for the last one.
1184
But there is a price at which most decent companies can get public at,, above a certain critical mass.
1185
Price clears all markets.
1186
That's what price is meant to do.
1187
And what you're seeing now is a degree of realism creeping in.
1188
And as a result of that, transactions taking place.
1189
It's totally healthy.
1190
All righty, we're going to do a Cauchy quick fire.
1191
As I said, this is the prediction marketplace my team adores.
1192
So we're going to go with the first one.
1193
Will OpenAI Johnny Ive device have a screen?
1194
Yes or no?
1195
Well, your team didn't ask when, right?
1196
Yes.
1197
Thank you, Jason.
1198
You've got it.
1199
So here's my thesis.
1200
Listen, if you read the internet, it says that it'll be a pendant on your neck and it'll have no screen.
1201
And even Sam's alluded to that, right?
1202
It's going to be a voice interaction device.
1203
I think the only thing that makes sense, and this is why you buy Johnny Ive, is it's everything.
1204
So it's a pendant on your neck.
1205
It's an app in your phone.
1206
It is listening on our computers.
1207
It is listening on our laptops.
1208
It is a ring Aura.
1209
And importantly, it's an AirPod, right?
1210
Because AirPod is great.
1211
AirPod already does all this.
1212
And if you build all of them and the sunglasses Meta, if you build all of them eventually, some combine and a watch.
1213
You got to have a watch.
1214
So you just, people do watch.
1215
If you do all of them and they're all Johnny Ive level, you solve this problem.
1216
Because we're not all guys sitting in a coffee shop with three things on the bar and our triple espresso.
1217, my son wears AirPods 12 hours a day.
1218
Rory probably will do the necklace because he likes that open the button shirt, hang out with the necklace, gold chain look, right?
1219
The Hawaiian show.
1220
Harry will have the sunglasses, the polarized sunglasses with his AI.
1221
In the land of no sun.
1222
So, yeah, yours will have AI.
1223
Now, there may be a screen in it.
1224
So I think the answer.
1225
So the first thing that comes out will be no, but ultimately it will be all of it.
1226
It'll be yes.
1227
It'll have audio.
1228
It'll have screen.
1229
It'll be everything.
1230
It'll be in those sunglasses.
1231
Because I don't think anyone's going to figure out a new paradigm.
1232
He's just going to figure out how it's all elegant.
1233
You're saying yes.
1234
The family, the family of devices will have a screen.
1235
Rory?
1236
Yeah, I'll probably go with Jason's answer in an uninformed way.
1237
I think the when question is more interesting and will it work?
1238, the interesting question would have been: will the device sell more than 5 million units in the first full year of shipping?
1239
And I would take the under.
1240
It might be 50 bucks, though.
1241
That's the thing.
1242
You could they have enough money to subsidize it.
1243
This is true.
1244
Dude, I would take the overall not.
1245
Yeah, that's a fun bet.
1246
Do that.
1247
You want to do that as a bet?
1248
Yeah, fine, done.
1249
What are we going to bet?
1250
We'll figure it out.
1251 what?
1252
You can buy me the device when I beat you.
1253
So there we go.
1254
Jason, when they sell 5 million in the first year, I will buy you the 5 million and one.
1255
Absolutely.
1256
Done.
1257
Oh, it's wonderful.
1258
And it's now you can buy me Dano at the best.
1259
What am I choosing?
1260
Done.
1261
Will Matter release an AI model that isn't open source this year?
1262
They don't appear to be able to release a lot right now.
1263
They appear to be having some gear grinding internally.
1264
My guess is that would be a decision based on some perceived security issues around open source.
1265
Other than that, I see no reason to change the bet they're currently on, which has been the open source bet.
1266
So no, in the absence of DC intervention, is my call.
1267, we underestimate the importance of Lama in portions of the developer community.
1268
It's already not fully open.
1269
We don't even know what data set it's trained on.
1270
The one thing from these guys, going even they're in Levy's, but Zuck's on another level, hyper-competitive.
1271
And if releasing a fully closed source model makes them more competitive, I think they will.
1272
So I think it's more than 35%.
1273
I think it's a yes.
1274
I think Zach needs to.
1275
I wouldn't bet against Zach on that.
1276
Final one: Elon Musk is back into Tesla and everything in between.
1277
Will Elon be out as Tesla CEO before 2027?
1278
To be clear, I read that as an odds bet.
1279
They're saying it's only a one-third chance that that happens, correct?
1280
I don't think it's likely.
1281
I don't think it's the base case, but you never discount the random event.
1282, I don't know the guy's motivation from Adam, but it's been painful in every dimension.
1283
And,, coming back, it's probably not going to be fun.
1284
And so you can never discount a rage quit, I suppose, would be that.
1285
Especially when you have the fun of SpaceX and XAI to go to.
1286
So you don't do it because you think it's that.
1287
You do it because you think the odds on the Calci bet are low enough, high enough in terms of return that it's not a crazy thing to do.
1288
Jason?
1289
Listen, he's not the CEO of his other companies for a reason.
1290
I don't think he wants to be CEO of Tesla.
1291
I just don't think he could find anybody.
1292
He had his CTO, I forget how you pronounce his name, J.B.
1293
Straubble.
1294
Is that how you say his name?
1295
I think he wanted him to be the CEO of Tesla when he was ready.
1296
I think the problems were huge.
1297
He needed to be the Sam Altman of Tesla.
1298
He needed to be the face.
1299
And the problems were to do everything.
1300
Electric, AI, automation, trucks.
1301
It just was so intense.
1302
He had to be the CEO, but he wasn't the founder.
1303
I think if he could find someone better, now that he's out of that administration and now that he's reflecting on life, right, and working harder, I think if by the end of 2027, I think this is the question.
1304
By the end of 2027, or by the end of 2026 is the bet, right?
1305
Before 27, can he in the next 18 months find someone better than him for the job?
1306
I'd say more than 32%.
1307
You see, exactly.
1308
He'll go 50%.
1309
So that means I got to say yes on this bet.
1310
Is that how it works?
1311
That's what it means.
1312
You think that...
1313
Yes.
1314, he didn't even pick someone very good for Twitter.
1315
What's her name?
1316
She's terrible, right?
1317
I know.
1318
Linda.
1319
And he could also find a nominal CEO for Tesla.
1320
He could find someone that's better than her, right?
1321
But he could still run the company he does Twitter or X.
1322
So I think it's more than 50% because he can't scale as a human being CEO of Tesla and Neuralink and SpaceX and going to Mars.
1323
You just can't do it.
1324
So now that he's out of the administration, I think he will try to recruit somebody just Mark Benioff will.
1325
Mark Benioff's tried four or five times to get out too.
1326
He's hired three other co-CEOs.
1327
It just hasn't worked.
1328
It just hasn't balanced the right thing for Marketing.
1329
I just want to throw it out that there is the complexity of the great comp package that has been held up by a Delaware judge who clearly just has a thing about stopping him.
1330
And that's got to be run to ground.
1331
But yeah, there's enough complexity there that just as a pure betting person, I'm with Jason.
1332
You look at the odds and you go, it mightn't be the right thing to happen.
1333
It mightn't be what you want, but hey, it's not a crazy outcome just given the amount of change that's going on right now.
1334
And also, to be honest, from the Tesla brand perspective, it might allow them to put some distance between their customer base and a fairly controversial person.
1335
So I could totally see it happening.
1336
I also think when you look at the time difference there, 18 months now till 2027, you look at how XAI and Grok are going for him, their recent raise as well.
1337
18 months is so long in AI.
1338
Elon is a master of moving to the most impactful thing in the world that he has.
1339
It could be that.
1340
And I think you see the performance issues at Twitter and the realization that he is a human still.
1341
He's not got.
1342
And that realization comes home to Roost and he goes, Fuck, I need management teams.
1343, he recruited Ilya to OpenAI, right?
1344
He's the guy can recruit.
1345
His most talented CEO, I think.
1346
Don't hate on Twitter.
1347
That was an impossible job.
1348
Gwen Shotwell appears to be one of the most amazing managers ever down there at SpaceX.
1349,, sending rockets up and most of the time having them work and building an amazing business.
1350
That's just been stunning management.
1351
So you have to think he wants to reproduce that if he can, now that he has a moment to reflect.
1352
He's, can I have a Gwen for a different company?
1353
It's public.
1354
There's drama.
1355
There's comp issues.
1356
But he's got to be, but he's got to have thought for a decade.
1357
And I think he did try with his CTO.
1358
But now that he can try again, I got to find my Gwen.
1359
I can't survive with the 58 kids in the 11 companies if I don't find one, right?
1360
Pretty, pretty big load, to be fair.
1361
Yeah, that's good.
1362
Guys, no politics, no personalities.
1363
Let's leave families out.
1364
Okay, no politics, no family.
1365
It's just a cognitive load.
1366
That's all.
1367
It is a cognitive load.
1368
Totally.
1369
Even Elon only has 24 hours a day, turns out.
1370
And a Neuralink round this week.
1371
I thought that was fascinating.
1372
But, guys, listen, I always love this.
1373 it.

We spend nearly half our waking hours glued to our phones, upwards of 50 hours every week.

Recently, one company transforming this reality stood out so much I personally became a shareholder, Mode Mobile.

Mode Mobile created the Earn Phone, the smartphone that pays you for daily activities.
