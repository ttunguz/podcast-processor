1
Where's Antonio Gracias?
2
Bring him up.
3
How bad is it?
4
How messed up is our government?
5
So if Twitter was like the JV League, this is like the NBA.
6
It's the most complex thing I've ever seen.
7
How is he able to find big balls?
8
Where do they show up?
9
Do they just apply out of the blue?
10
I mean, where do these guys come from?
11
You found some people who were illegal immigrants who registered to vote?
12
Yes, this is actually true.
13
Every vote that is cast in Leading America nullifies the vote of an American citizen.
14
So Antonio, we know you're very busy because you decided, like a couple of our other friends, to take a second job working in our government for 100 or so days.
15
Yeah, you can give a round of applause for that.
16
You know, Trump is a unique individual in all the world.
17
It may be polarizing in some ways, but one thing that's not polarizing is Doge.
18
I think everybody wants to see waste, fraud, and abuse and controlled spending in government.
19
Maybe there's some questions about how fast it's going, but we all know you and Elon like to go, you know, at a brisk pace.
20
You laid back and you joined a little later in the process.
21
Like a stat, you joined maybe, what, 15, 20 days ago?
22
I've been there for eight weeks.
23
Eight weeks, okay.
24
So eight weeks.
25
Yeah, 60 days.
26
And you went public with it maybe a couple weeks ago.
27
Yeah.
28
I was in Louis on Maryland for the first four weeks, so you didn't know I was there.
29
Yes.
30
So how bad is it?
31
How messed up is our government?
32
How insane are the processes?
33
You're a process guy.
34
You know, we both worked on the Twitter acquisition and the transfer there and did all the zero-based budgeting.
35
I mean, maybe compare and contrast it to that, which was maybe one of the most horrific corporate entities I've ever seen in my life and how that was being run.
36
It was tough.
37
Well, let me try to thank you guys.
38
Thank you for having me.
39
I really appreciate it.
40
It's great to be honest here to see everybody.
41
I'm grateful my partners for allowing me to do it and my clients for supporting it.
42
And it truly is an honor to be.
43
There's many great people in the government trying to help.
44
So let me just start with that.
45
It's a sacrifice, right?
46
You're taking time out of your day.
47
It's definitely a sacrifice, but it really, I feel very grateful that I have the capacity and 30 years of training in lead operations that I can be useful.
48
You know, that feels very, I feel gratitude.
49
Yeah, how bad is it?
50
So if Twitter was like the JV League, this is like the MBA.
51
It's the most complex thing I've ever seen.
52
I have in our office in D.C., I have a, I've mapped now, as an example, the entire system of basically from the border to the benefits programs.
53
It's about a 40-foot board, and it looks like a bosquiach.
54
I mean, it's an incredible, like spaghetti gram stuff.
55
And yeah, I've never seen anything so complex in my life.
56
So the answer to your question is: it's worse than I thought, much, much worse than what we saw at Twitter Now X.
57
And America, Americans, and all of you, we deserve better.
58
Okay.
59
If we were to, and I'm sure Shabbat has some questions at Freeberry, but if we were to look at $1 spent by our government, waste, fraud, abuse, how many pennies of the dollar is it?
60
If you had to just, based on what you've seen so far, arrange.
61
Here's what Sets: if you go into any company, any company you guys have ever seen, that is not like super well-run, it probably is like easy cut, 15%.
62
Easy, easy, easy.
63
This is where the 15%, this is where the Trojan Dollar number came.
64
I think if we had the political will, you'd easily get that 15%, no problem, not without any problem at all, and without cutting the core entitlement programs.
65
So it's definitely there.
66
The question is: do people want to do it or not?
67
And remember, every dollar we take, we are taking from an NGO or a Beltway consultant.
68
You know, it's actually, the people are screaming about this because we're taking money from them.
69
And it is, whatever you read in the news media, I got to tell you, it isn't true.
70
I mean, the cuts, I think it's 88% of the people that have left the government have taken packages.
71
The packages are very lucrative.
72
They're sort of nine months or so of severance, and they're voluntary.
73
So, yeah, I tell you, I'd also say the people that work in government who are good, there's lots of good people in the government that I have met and have pointed this at all this stuff, they deserve better.
74
Imagine trying to be a civil servant, you want to do the right thing, you're working there because you care about America, and you're in this massive bureaucratic morass with all this stuff on top of you.
75
And man, I've seen OIG reports where people have reported the OIG like sex trafficking, and they turn it in, and nothing happens.
76
Like, literally, nothing happens.
77
Okay, so that's very frustrating, and they stick it out, they keep going, and they keep working hard for America.
78
So, I think it's not just about the cost cuts, it's about the culture.
79
Like, the culture change of allowing good people who are in the government to understand that someone's listening, that when they want to make improvement and change, or when they find fraud, waste, and abuse, they can do it, and there's an avenue now to do it.
80
I think that's actually going to be one of the most important, lasting thing we leave: is this idea that your voice matters in the government, that there are good people in the government, and when they want to do the right thing, there's a way to do it.
81
And you got people coming back to work in the office.
82
When I got there, just like at Twitter, the parking lot was empty.
83
And I'm talking about stadium-sized parking, okay?
84
Empty.
85
The office was empty.
86
There was no one in the corporate office, the headquarters office in Woodland, Maryland.
87
And then, because we follow our process of mapping from end-to-end system, we went to visit a couple of offices.
88
I went to one myself.
89
The one that I went to, there were about 20 people in the waiting room.
90
There were seven people in the windows.
91
Of the seven people, three had their shades half down.
92
Those people were taking phone calls because during COVID, they turned everyone into phone operators.
93
What we learned is they were still running on COVID operations.
94
So we have now, through our efforts and efforts of the interim administrator, brought everyone back to the office and back to the offices in the field.
95
We haven't closed one field office, not one since we've been there.
96
Everything you're reading about service levels is not true.
97
What I saw, imagine how frustrating that is.
98
If you're waiting in the waiting room, you see seven windows out of 25 open, and three other people are taking phone calls, and you're waiting.
99
I mean, totally service.
100
So, look, like in all the companies that we all run, we always talk about using incentives to shape the outcome you want.
101
And I think you keep insisting, which I think is right, that civil servants, by and large, want the right things to happen.
102
That's why they chose to go and work for the government.
103
So, what is the incentive we need to change?
104
Is it a compensation incentive?
105
Is it like what?
106
Like, what is it?
107
Look, I think the people that work in the government, it's a normal distribution of the game, right?
108
It's 2.5 million people in the government plus contractors.
109
And some people are great, some people aren't great, and a lot of people in the middle.
110
And the people in the middle react to the incentives, as you point out.
111
I think the most important thing here is transparency of the message.
112
The incentives we should create are transparency and some basic metrics.
113
They know how they're doing.
114
You know, we were, for example, at Social Security, we were criticized for the website uptime.
115
Well, turns out website uptime has been better since we got there than after Imagine we have engineers and we've now published the metrics in the website publicly so people can see it so the engineering team now managing the website can see you know that they're doing a good job or not doing a good job and the public can see if they're doing a good job or not doing a good job I don't think the financial incentives are always useful but this is not just about money like for example if you if you look at Singapore the Singaporean approach from Lee Kuan Yew was let's create a government that is extremely empowered but let's also make it quite small let's make them more compensated and let's try to find sort of an elite cadre of folks is that approach possible in the United States or should we even think that we should try something like that I mean look Singapore is a unique experiment in the world it's also a place where you you know you might end up getting caned if you drop chewing gun on the ground okay so in America where we have a different a different level of I would say of freedom and rights you know we should strive for a civil service that is professional well compensated and mission oriented and that mission orientation is serving the United States and I think that gets back to look there are very good people that want a great thing serve their country that's why they're there and it's I wouldn't make it I wouldn't make it about the money I would make it about the mission and we'll get the we get there are very good people that are there on mission I met them they are the ones pointing all this stuff out to us.
116
Right.
117
Yeah.
118
Can you talk about you guys?
119
Went on Fox the other day with the Doge team.
120
Big Balls.
121
And Big Balls was there.
122
We were talking about this backstage.
123
All of those guys were like 12 years old.
124
What is it about the role, the opportunity, the way it was presented that attracted this group of what were incredibly well-spoken, highly intelligent, clearly extraordinarily motivated individuals?
125
It's the sort of caliber of talent that all of us aspire to hire and, first of all, find, hire, and then they're on the mission.
126
Is it Elon's inspiration and the reach he has that made this happen?
127
Is this a particular moment in American history?
128
Because I was looking at that table and I was thinking about like the founding fathers and the age of the founding fathers when they wrote the Declaration of Independence.
129
They were all super young.
130
And I was like, man, this is an opportunity to kind of rewrite how government operates in America today.
131
But I was just struck by the age and the talent and how that came together and kind of where do they show up?
132
Do they just apply out of the blue?
133
And you guys have recruiters out there?
134
I mean, where do these guys come from?
135
So we do have a recruiting team actually.
136
They're great.
137
Barish and Emily do the recruiting.
138
And I'll tell you, I just want to stop for a second and say this.
139
This is extraordinary.
140
These people are extraordinary.
141
All of them.
142
The young people you saw at the table are extraordinary.
143
They're amazing engineers.
144
I mean, they're like any one of us would be, they're 10x engineers.
145
We would all be thrilled to have our companies.
146
Elon obviously is an extraordinary leader, so they come for him.
147
But I think they're really motivated by the mission.
148
They're motivated by the idea that this is a moment where they can actually get a note.
149
And there are extraordinary, extraordinary people there, man.
150
So you saw the people at the table.
151
In that particular interview, I didn't say a word.
152
I literally, it wasn't they cut me.
153
It was you and the other guy.
154
Yeah, I didn't say anything.
155
The reason I didn't say anything was because I didn't need to.
156
These guys are extraordinary.
157
And one of the men there spoke about this, Ethan.
158
He's in my son's class at Harvard.
159
He dropped out of Harvard with two classes left to come do this.
160
Big Ball is an example.
161
He's great.
162
I mean, I work with an engineer named Ram is great.
163
And then, and I got to tell you, there's a whole other strata of people you didn't see there who are kind of in their 30s.
164
I think my buddy Josh is working on the college stuff and a few other things.
165
These guys are, I mean, this guy was a senior executive from Rising Store at KKR, left his job to come do this.
166
And there's an innumerable number of people like this.
167
It's an extraordinary group.
168
I feel honored to be part of it.
169
I feel honored to work with them.
170
But it really is making it.
171
Can I tell you an answer to this?
172
Yeah, but I just want, like, do you think that this, because these guys aren't going to work in the government forever?
173
They're coming in, they're building something, they're activating, and they're moving on back to their private life, like the founding fathers did at the start of the American government.
174
Is that a better model for how government should operate rather than have career employees, career politicians, but treat it more like civil service, where everyone has some role that they should play at some point, like they do in Israel, where you have to, you know, go to the Army for a few years and everyone is required?
175
Same in Singapore, actually.
176
Yeah.
177
Where everyone kind of has to go spend their time in the government, contribute, participate, but it doesn't become a mechanism where there's an incentive to grow it and get more.
178
It's a great point on Singapore.
179
Actually, I should have brought that up when Jamath asked a question.
180
I think that we're proving there's two types of people in government today.
181
There's careers, they call them in politicals, right?
182
I think there should be a third type, which is what you're talking about.
183
People that are doing public service for a short duration, shorter duration, whether it's me 130 as an SG or it's a couple of years as an engineer or something.
184
I think a culture of this in America would be great for America and great not just for what it does to the government, but how it binds us as a people, right?
185
Serving your country, going there, seeing how hard it is, seeing the way it works, understanding really from the inside what's going on.
186
Listen, I had no idea.
187
It's like, what part of the government did you work in for your two-year service or 18 months, right?
188
This would be a great thing for America and a great thing for our society because that culture of public service, I think, would bring us closer together.
189
Jamath, you were going to say something about the...
190
I had a.
191
I mean, without saying too much, but you can guess.
192
So all of us have known Elon for a really long time.
193
I also worked for another person that's of that same stature for a long time.
194
He's much shorter.
195
Much shorter.
196
And one of a very good friend of his came to see me recently for lunch, and he asked me this exact same question about Elon.
197
He said, like it was kind of like just like the, that's the question that they were grappling with.
198
How is he able to find big balls?
199
And so many big balls.
200
I actually can tell you.
201
I've seen him find big balls.
202
Yeah, it's a serious strategy.
203
But what he does is.
204
We should do that.
205
And then I've been CC'd on messages where he sends them to the right person.
206
He has people to vet them and see if this idea actually works.
207
And I think he's very opportunistic and doesn't prejudge where you went to school, what your credentials is.
208
It's almost the opposite.
209
The less credentialed you are, he has a predisposition to think you're more right.
210
Have you solved a problem?
211
By the way, this is a Peter Thiel.
212
But my answer to this was: there's a lot of people that can be responsive in email.
213
I think there's a handful of people that are real northern stars for technical talent.
214
But he's the only one that, when you walk in the room, he says, Here's this mission.
215
And it is so generally otherworldly.
216
Nobody else can really say that.
217
It is a flywheel, as you said, that is extremely unique.
218
The fact that you can direct that entropy to the United States government, I think, is a blessing.
219
Now, the question is: how do we follow up and make it attractive?
220
Because to your point, I saw those kids on that interview, and any of my five kids, if they had done what they did, I would have been so proud.
221
I was so impressed with these kids.
222
They're impressive.
223
And you're like, you're proud to be an American watching these kids.
224
You saw Elon's face nodding while they were speaking with a grin ear to ear.
225
He was proud.
226
He was like, they were his prayers.
227
He is proud.
228
Well, yeah, he is proud.
229
I think it's important for maybe people to sit back and say, this has all been done in 100 days from a cold start.
230
It's not like you brought in people, you brought in people who are like, I know the lay of the land here.
231
It was like, we're going to figure this out from first principles, do zero-based budgeting, whatever it is, look at the data and see where it leads us.
232
And I think one of the disturbing things about the data and most controversial issues.
233
And why did Biden let so many people through the border?
234
It was kind of a question if it was even happening.
235
Should we trust these border encounter numbers?
236
It doesn't seem real.
237
And there's a lack of trust in the government.
238
One side is saying, hey, we let all these people in.
239
There's 15, 20 million extra people here in order to vote Democratic.
240
Doesn't make a lot of sense to me since the Republicans have become the working party.
241
But putting all that aside, you started looking at this, and we had a discussion privately about: hey, are these people signing up to vote?
242
Because that would be an indicator that this theory that people were streaming across the border in order to vote, you found some people who were illegal immigrants who registered to vote.
243
This is confounding.
244
Yes, this is actually true.
245
So we have sampled a handful of states, and in those handful of states, we found people registered to vote, and we have found people who actually voted.
246
And this is all being done by sampling.
247
So we are sampling DHS data and then have to go to the voter rolls, check the voter rolls, and then check the, they give that to HSI, Homeland Security Investigations, who goes and checks the voter record by subpoena and a voter and the cards you sign when you vote.
248
We had already three arrests here in Florida, actually, and one indictment.
249
And is that publicly known?
250
Yes, we posted it.
251
The DOJ.
252
But the media have not covered it.
253
I haven't seen much about that.
254
So you're saying these are three individuals who legally secured a social security number.
255
They illegally secured social security numbers through the process we talked about last time, asylum or some special program or whatever, and they were given.
256
And they registered to vote, and they actually voted in 2020 and/or 2024.
257
Three have been arrested.
258
I just want to say this carefully.
259
Three have been arrested, and one has been indicted.
260
The one we indicted, I want to just stop on this guy for a minute.
261
He's an Iraqi national.
262
He voted in 2020 in New York.
263
He went to prison for shooting somebody, shot some guy's hand off, has charged, if I remember correctly, $60,000 or $70,000 of benefits through Medicaid.
264
And we think, is now in Iraq because he's active on his Facebook page, and the IP address is from Iraq.
265
And credit to our friends at HSI, our partners HSI, and to DOJ for tracking this down.
266
I got to tell you guys, it's difficult, laborious work.
267
It really is.
268
But think about that a minute.
269
Is that the tip of the iceberg, Antonio, do you think?
270
Or did you guys do a lot of mining and a lot of digging to come up with those four?
271
How big of a magnitude of a problem do you think this is?
272
What's your intuition tell you honestly right now about whether there's massive voter fraud or not?
273
Great question, and I want to be careful how I answer it.
274
I'm going to leave the data.
275
So I'm not leaving the data, and I'm entering the area of my opinion, which is what you're asking me.
276
My opinion is, and actually, let me sit back and tell you what we did a second and then tell you my opinion.
277
We are sampling by hand.
278
So when you say data mining, we're not mining.
279
We're actually like pick and shovel going into like by hand.
280
This is not mechanized.
281
There's no AI being applied.
282
We're using SQL queries.
283
You're literally pulling one of those.
284
Literally snapping a name out of the work authorization database, DHS, checking that against the voter roll, and then go run it down to the state.
285
Super laborious, okay?
286
So with that, I don't know.
287
And I don't want to speculate because I think it would be not the right thing to do at this moment.
288
I think we'll have more data over time.
289
But for sure, if we can sample out of a database, and it takes an engineer about a day to find 20-ish cases.
290
So what DOJ asks for was 10 to 20 cases per state.
291
Just to give you a sense of what's happening, it takes an engineer about a day to find 10 to 20 cases per state in sampling.
292
That gives you an idea of how many there are.
293
That's going on.
294
Are you shocked that people don't care about this more?
295
I'm shocked.
296
I think people really do.
297
Should we care more?
298
Yeah.
299
Yes.
300
Well, yes, I want to separate the questions.
301
I think people care more.
302
My guess is everyone here cares a lot, okay, a lot about this.
303
I think for some reason the news media doesn't care more.
304
Now, should you care?
305
Yes.
306
You know, there's this idea, like, it's always a little bit of fraud, it's pervasive.
307
It's not a big deal, wrong.
308
Here's the reality: every vote that is cast illegally in America nullifies the vote of an American citizen.
309
It is your constitutional right to vote in America.
310
And if we don't have a zero defect system, we are violating your constitutional rights.
311
And I will tell you, you deserve, the American public deserves, that we strive for a zero defect system.
312
We make medical devices in America with a zero defect system.
313
We shouldn't make votes with a zero defect system.
314
If we don't strive for a zero defect system, we will get a lot more fraud.
315
This is what the real idea is so important.
316
We should strive for this.
317
And it doesn't matter if it's one vote.
318
It's easily solved with the last 15 states that don't require voter ID.
319
Just simply do that.
320
And that would pretty much end this debate, I think.
321
I mean, well, I want to tell you, there are states that do require ID.
322
I think Real ID will solve it.
323
There's a database called Save that is available to the states.
324
In the Biden administration, they raised the price, when I think about a dollar, an API call, to $3 and change the API call, and all the states stop using it.
325
SAVE is a database that has the actual citizenship data for the entire country.
326
We're cleaning it up now and making the actual UI much better.
327
If the states have Real ID and they use SAVE, you will solve this problem.
328
And I cannot understand why a state would not do this.
329
Whose decision would it be to just change the cost of that API?
330
So, great question, Jamath.
331
The Secretary of Homeland Security, I want to thank her, Secretary Noam, has just signed a memo, a policy memo, to make it free.
332
Yeah, but why is that charged anyway?
333
It doesn't make any sense to me.
334
Yes.
335
That's the very simple thing.
336
Secretary Gnome made this free.
337
Your parents.
338
I know your dad is an immigrant.
339
My parents are both in real free.
340
Both immigrants.
341
Two immigrants sitting here.
342
My mother came here to last speak English.
343
Yeah.
344
So to be familiar with the future.
345
Me too.
346
You're an immigrant, also an immigrant, seventh generation.
347
No one's fit.
348
Which way is it?
349
I don't know.
350
Who's not?
351
Is it?
352
Oh, Jason.
353
Who do you think?
354
Seventh generation.
355
I'm the all-in presidential candidate by default.
356
I don't know.
357
You're from Mount Olympus, though.
358
Yes, and the five points.
359
But how should immigration work in this country?
360
You know, we've talked about it on RPOD, the point-based system, et cetera.
361
We still want immigration.
362
We need high-skilled immigration.
363
We talked to President Trump about that.
364
He said he was committed to giving people green cards who have diplomas.
365
And this is a little out of your purview, but just how does Antonio Gracias feel about immigration, you know, deporting people, you know, deporting people with maybe less due process than maybe some of us are comfortable with?
366
What do you think we should be doing here as a country?
367
There's a lot in that question.
368
Yes.
369
So, look, I'm an enormous fan of immigration.
370
I mean, you will not find a guy who's more pro-immigration than I am because my parents are immigrants.
371
They came here with nothing and built a life, and I am the American dream.
372
And I'm so grateful this country what it's done for my family.
373
You go and you won't find it.
374
I am so grateful for this country.
375
It has been great for us, okay?
376
And for all of you.
377
The reality is that we need.
378
Thank you.
379
American GDP is simply the function of the number of people working, time of productivity.
380
We have 7 million job openings, roughly, in America.
381
We need people to work.
382
Yes.
383
This is the reality.
384
The system should very simply be: there's a skilled immigration group, and we figure out what that should be, what jobs you want.
385
And by the way, America is the best place to live in the world.
386
We all know that.
387
I believe that.
388
If we make this easy, they will come, right?
389
No problem.
390
And I think there's broad agreement in that.
391
We also need labor.
392
We do.
393
Our farmers need labor, need labor in the food industry, restaurants, et cetera.
394
I think there should be both high-end scale immigration and there should be a very sensible program for unskilled labor, a work permit program.
395
And you can see that.
396
We've got that H-2A program.
397
There is the H-2A program.
398
I will tell you, these programs, I map the entire system now.
399
They go from DHS to State Department to labor.
400
They're very disconnected and they're hard to manage.
401
One of the things we're going to work on and hopefully leave behind is both a sensible answer to the illegal problem and a sensible answer to the legal problem.
402
It's very important the team work on this.
403
This is like super important for Trump's administration because there seems to be a bit of a, I don't want to call it a civil war, but heated debate internally between people like yourself and Elon and others who believe immigration is critical and then other people who just want to lock the border and deport 20 million people.
404
I'll call this Steve Banning camp.
405
He's not in the administration, clearly.
406
Locking the borders, I want to be clear on this something.
407
I don't believe in open borders.
408
When a country opens a border, this country cedes its sovereignty.
409
Yes.
410
You have to have a closer.
411
You have to have a border that is country.
412
I agree on that.
413
That doesn't mean you shouldn't have legal immigration.
414
Right.
415
It should be a proper process where people can come in that are great for the country and they believe in our values.
416
And they should have a chance to become citizens if they believe in our values to support our country.
417
I really hope that you guys work this out and can have a positive influence like you've had with Doge on the administration and really work on this one, which is sensible, kind, you know, empathetic immigration.
418
Yeah.
419
Because you're all immigrants.
420
I mean, the values I set for our team, I'll just tell you, the valor execution values are focus, intensity, and discipline.
421
I added a fourth value here to our team for our team, compassion.
422
Yes.
423
Antonio, I just want, and I want anyone else to join me in saying, look, you're a successful, wealthy, incredibly handsome man.
424
That's the best part.
425
But, like, I know the work you're doing is super hard.
426
We talked backstage about how hard it's been.
427
I just want to honestly say, as an American, thank you for the work you're doing.
428
And all the energy.
429
Thank you, bro.
430
All right.
431
Thanks to my friend Antonio Gracias for joining us.

454
Oh, man.
455
My appetite has a media.
456
You should all just get a room and just have it one big huge order because you're all these new stuff.
457
What?
458
You're your feet.
459
Waiting to get Murphy's article.
460
I'm going to leave it.
