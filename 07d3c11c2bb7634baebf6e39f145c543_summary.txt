Generating around 3 million API requests per month, aiming to reach 3 billion per day. Recently received angel funding.

2. KEY INSIGHTS

Insight 1: Jigsaw Stack is focused on addressing the issue of AI hallucination in real-world applications.
Supporting Quote: "Hallucination is one of the biggest pain points that we are trying to solve. I think we have solved to an extent...when it comes to back-end use cases for example using OpenAI to do OCR on passport information in a consistent manner or having translation that you can validate...those are things that get really scary right to use in the real application because hallucination at least such a big part in breaking those things."
Significance: Hallucination is a major challenge preventing wider adoption of AI models in critical business applications. Solving this unlocks many use cases.

Insight 2: Jigsaw Stack trains specialized AI models for specific tasks to minimize hallucination and errors.
Supporting Quote: "One of the things that we focus in our models it's very specialized models, it's not hyper generic stuff. So if you launch an OCR model, it's very much fine-tuned, trained to prevent hallucination when it comes to OCR applications or translation for the translation model."
Significance: Rather than relying on generic large language models, training models for specific tasks allows greater accuracy and reliability for real-world AI deployments.

Insight 3: Quantizing AI models to lower precision levels (e.g. FP16, FP24) is viable for some use cases, especially on edge devices and CPUs. 
Supporting Quote: "Lower FP levels are definitely viable in some in some use cases you know, so if you're making really small models, if you have FP4 makes sense...to be really quick they typically run on the CPU, they should run very fast."
Significance: Quantization allows deploying AI models on lower-power edge devices and CPUs rather than relying on expensive GPUs, enabling many new applications.

Insight 4: Jigsaw Stack is focused on the developer experience, making it simple to plug AI capabilities into any tech stack.
Supporting Quote: "Our focus has really been on develop experience...figuring out what we wanted to do, how we gonna build our models...2025 is really focus on the develop experience and this is why we are working with partners, building our SDK in a way that's super simple right, you don't have to think, you just plug and play."
Significance: Lowering integration barriers is key to driving mainstream adoption of AI by the broader developer community beyond AI experts.

Insight 5: Jigsaw Stack aims to provide an alternative to big cloud AI services from AWS, Azure, Google Cloud which are often subpar in quality.
Supporting Quote: "If you look into the business model they have two big sectors - infrastructure...and the other half of the business that I believe that they aren't doing very well is their service business...all of them provide some sort of API for OCR or translation or text to speech, speech to text and they suck, they really really suck."
Significance: Displacing the incumbent cloud providers with better AI services creates a large market opportunity. Developers are often locked in due to existing hosting and lack of alternatives.

3. TECHNOLOGY & PRODUCT DEVELOPMENTS

Key technical/product innovations discussed:
- Fine-tuning AI models for specific tasks to minimize hallucination 
- Quantizing models to lower precision levels for deployment on edge devices and CPUs
- Simple SDKs and integrations to abstract away AI complexity for developers

Core differentiation points:
- Higher quality, more reliable AI models compared to generic cloud provider services
- Easy integration into any tech stack via APIs and SDKs
- Faster model performance through quantization and specialization

Future development plans mentioned: 
- Launching an embedding model as a service 
- Building a "workflows" platform to allow chaining together multiple Jigsaw Stack AI tools
- Continuing to expand the suite of AI capabilities beyond just large language models

4. COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
[Insufficient information in the transcript to include this section]

5. TEAM & CULTURE SIGNALS

Leadership philosophy and approach:
- Supporting indie developers and engineers rather than just large corporate customers
- Preferring organic community engagement over paid advertising at an early stage

Team building strategies:
- Currently has a small 4 person team
- Hiring for both full-stack engineering and AI research roles
- Recently brought on a head of developer relations to drive content and community

6. KEY METRICS & BUSINESS DETAILS

Growth, revenue, or user metrics shared:
- Approaching 5,000 monthly active users
- Handling approximately 3 million API requests per month 
- Goal is to reach 3 billion API requests per day

Go-to-market insights:
- Seeing traction through video content, benchmarks, open source code vs just blog posts
- Finding customers through integrations and partnerships with other dev tool companies
- Daily pings sponsorship drove initial user acquisition but not core strategy

Pricing and monetization approach:
- Usage-based pricing model 
- Free tier of 100 credits, then $27/month and up based on scale
- Keeping prices as low as possible, only charging for what developers use vs large upfront commitments

7. NOTABLE TECHNOLOGIES

Novel technical approaches discussed:
- Applying LLMs to clean up output of highly compressed/quantized base models (e.g. Whisper)
- Chaining specialized models together into "workflows" as an alternative to large generalist models
- Using quantization and specialization to run AI on edge devices and CPUs vs expensive GPUs

8. COMPANIES MENTIONED

Jigsaw Stack: The company founded by the guest Yovan. Focuses on building fast, specialized AI models that plug into different parts of the tech stack.

Groq: "We had a benchmark where we showed our whispered model like for our text to speech to text model is faster than groq not being the fast"

Daily Pings: "It's not a very big theme it's just four of us including myself but we are hiring right now so I don't know if this is a good place to show." Seems to be a job listing site Jigsaw Stack has sponsored.

Slack: Mentioned as a communication tool Jigsaw Stack is forced to use to work with some partners. Implied to be falling out of favor with newer startups.

Microsoft Teams: Another communication tool Jigsaw had to use to communicate with an enterprise customer in Mexico. Mentioned as undesirable.

Supabase: Mentioned as a company Jigsaw Stack has collaborated with on YouTube videos that drove customer acquisition.

Vercel: Another company Jigsaw Stack has collaborated with on YouTube videos that drove customer acquisition.
