1. EPISODE CONTEXT
- Podcast: Invest Like the Best
- Hosts: Patrick O'Shaughnessy (CEO of Positive Sum)
- Guest: Kelly Granit (Co-Chief Investment Officer and Managing Director at Lone Pine Capital)

2. KEY INSIGHTS

- Investing has evolved significantly, with more short-term focused trading, passive investing, quant funds, and the marginal trading volume being driven more by these than by fundamentally-oriented investors.
- There is more data, tools and collaboration available now compared to when Granit started, allowing deeper fundamental research.
- Lone Pine has adapted by running lower gross exposure to have flexibility to add to positions on non-fundamental sell-offs.
- Regime changes like the rising cost of capital in 2022 require quickly adjusting exposures - a lesson Lone Pine had to learn painfully.
- Great leadership and culture transformation can drastically change a company's trajectory.
- Balance across themes and industries in the portfolio is crucial to manage exposure to any single disruption.

3. TECHNOLOGY & PRODUCT DEVELOPMENTS
- AI/LLMs are seen as an exciting broad disruptive force creating many opportunities, though winners are still emerging.
- Lone Pine believes most value will accrue to enablers and application layers rather than LLM creators.

4. COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
- Granit doesn't view other fundamentally-oriented public equity investors as direct competition, instead focusing on continual self-improvement.
- The rise of passive, quant funds and short-term trading mentalities are bigger forces reshaping the investing landscape.

5. TEAM & CULTURE SIGNALS
- Lone Pine has a collaborative research culture with twice-weekly meetings discussing ideas across sectors.
- Lone Pine is focused on developing the next generation of leaders internally.
- They seek curious, multi-talented hires who have experienced adversity and can debate constructively.

6. KEY METRICS & BUSINESS DETAILS 
- Lone Pine runs a concentrated 25-30 stock long portfolio with 150-180% gross exposure currently.
- They have a dedicated data team supporting research efforts.
- Risk management is focused on analyzing patterns, factors and unintended exposures.

Something I speak about frequently on invest like the best is the idea of life's work.
A more fun way to think about it is that I'm looking for maniacs on a mission.
This is the basis for our investment firm, Positive Sum, and it's the reason why I am
so enthusiastic about our presenting sponsor, Ramp.
Not only are the founders, Kareem and Eric, Life's Work Level founders, certainly maniacs
on a mission, they have created a product that is effectively an unlock for founders
and finance team to do more of their life's work by streamlining financial operations,
saving everyone their most precious resource time.
Ramp has built a command and control system for corporate cards and expense management.
You can issue cards, manage approvals, make vendor payments of all kinds, and even automate
closing your books all in one place.
Speaking from my own experience using Ramp for my business, the product is wildly intuitive,
simplistic, and makes life so much easier that you'll feel bad for any company who hasn't
yet made the switch.
The Ramp team is relentless, and the product continues to evolve to save you time that you
would never have dreamed of getting back.
To me, there is nothing more interesting than technologies that reduce friction for other
entrepreneurs to be able to build the thing that they want to.
So much attention has gone to cloud computing, APIs, and other ways of making life easy for
founders.
What Ramp has done and is doing is build yet another set of tools in this category.
To get started, go to ramp.com.
Cards issued by Celtic Bank and Sutton Bank, member FDIC, terms and conditions apply.

My guest today is Kelly Granit.
Kelly is the co-chief investment officer and managing director at Lone Pine Capital, one
of the most storied and successful hedge fund and investment firms of the last several decades.
We explore how investing has evolved since Kelly joined the industry, and she shares insights
into Lone Pine maintaining its edge through deep fundamental research and a collaborative
culture.
We discuss what makes great businesses and great investments, how leadership can transform
companies, and Kelly's perspective on how the market often misprices management and corporate
change.
Please enjoy my conversation with Kelly Granit.
Kelly, maybe the fun place to begin is the playing field of investing as you see it.
I'm especially curious about how it feels the most different, not in terms of AI and where
the opportunities are, but just like the structure of the market itself and the game
of investing large dollars, trying to earn excess return in the structure that you do
it in, how you feel that has most changed from the beginning of your career doing it
to, through to today, running a very large, but one of the largest pools of capital at
one of the most storied firms.
What is most distinctive about today versus the past when you just think about the playing
field itself?
Interesting.
I mean, when I zoom out and think about starting as a summer intern in the summer of 2001 during
business school and then returning full time to the public markets in '22, the industry
was really different.
One, there were a lot more fundamentally oriented, directional, duration-oriented investors who
were doing deep research with three, four, five-year time horizon.
There were many fewer levered pods and certainly passive wasn't a thing yet.
It felt like the marginal dollar of volume on the exchanges was dictated more by what
fidelity or capital we're thinking, or maybe even sometimes at Laura Large-Hedgevon versus
what was happening at Citadel or what was happening with pods or what was happening with
passive.
In addition to that, when I think about organizational structure and how we did our jobs, the org
structure was, I think, most fundamental firms pretty siloed.
You could cover industrials.
You covered consumer.
You covered financials.
You were doing that with a peer set, really, of people outside of your firm who you developed
a network with over time, who you were sharing meetings with, going to conferences with.
The level of conversation amongst peers was just not as informed because people were operating
in sector silos in terms of knowledge and coverage and expertise and network.
In addition to that, the tools with which we used to do our jobs were pretty different.
You would meet with companies.
You would read filings.
You would go to conferences.
You would try to do some proprietary research, but things like credit card data and expert
networks and all of these tools that we all now use to supplement our fundamental researcher
as a part of our fundamental research didn't exist.
The ways to do the job and the ways to differentiate yourself, I think, were different and the
tools were different, certainly, that were available to you.
In addition to that, I would say at the portfolio level, when I look back and obviously I wasn't
managing a portfolio at that point in time, but looking up to my portfolio managers, the
tools to think about portfolio construction risk, portfolio analytics, none of these things
really existed.
As a fundamental investor, you were really going bottoms up, single stock, building a
portfolio that way, and obviously looking at things like what acted in concert with
one another, correlations, things like that, but it was a different job, so that's sort
of like a snapshot of 25 years ago, let's say.
Fast forward to today, and obviously market structure has evolved meaningfully as a function
of where the dollars are being traded, and obviously the emergence of passive and pods
has been sort of the giant sucking sound in the public markets for a long time, and I
feel like the marginal dollar being dictated by fundamental decisions that are long-term
oriented by the capitals, the fidelities, the tier of prices of the world is just less
meaningful on how stocks actually trade, and the new behavior it feels is more around
what we call kind of set-up dynamics, and that is a function largely of the dissemination
of a lot of the third-party data, creating set-up dynamics around events, quarters, conferences,
companies, you know, having, speaking, investor days, and how those events are being previewed
was a function of what third-party data is suggesting, or what the sort of litany of
sales traders at the banks are sort of prompting by side people with in terms of where the
whisper numbers are and so forth, and so that creates just a different trading dynamic
in terms of how you execute the job, right?
And in addition, obviously what I mentioned earlier, we do now have, as portfolio managers,
a lot of tools to help us think through risk differently, portfolio construction differently,
and then how that manifests itself is how we express sort of the fundamental sauce of
what we do, which is the fundamental research, right?
And so we were saying earlier, we're talking before we started about just our trading volume
has clearly got up over time on a dollar basis, less so on a name basis, because you get these
outsized reactions that are often non-fundamental in nature to events, quarters, and so forth,
and so all of those, you know, the tools are different, the resources are different, and
then the last piece would be just the collaborations different.
In contrast to what I described earlier, if kind of a siloed coverage model inside of
a firm is not uncommon for us to show up at a company's headquarters for a meeting with
four or five, six analysts, because there's people covering things that are adjacent to
the topic at hand and the company at hand, and so often there's insights to be gleaned
and questions to be asked that have implications for things that are outside of with purview
of the conversation of that day, and that is super helpful, and we meet as a group twice
a week, as a research team, and are sharing information constantly across our organization
because obviously five brains is better than one, and people have thoughts because they're
in the periphery of what we're actually discussing often with their own coverage areas, and
so the notion even of a coverage area, we kind of shy away from at this point because
we have so many people opining on different ideas and themes across the portfolio because
they have their own insights from their own work.
If I think about the spectrum in my mind on the one end maybe is like Buffett, and Buffett
could care less about whatever's happening with Coca-Cola on a given day, and it's going
to hold forever.
On the other hand, it's like my friends who run pods at Citadel, and their lives revolve
around these events, this kind of event structure that you're talking about, investor days,
quarterly earnings, et cetera, et cetera, and you're probably somewhere in between.
Is this healthy, this focus on this extraordinary extreme focus on the dissemination of information
at a couple of discrete moments like in a quarterly calendar?
Is that a good thing for markets?
Is that even the right way to think about it?
How do you think about--
Much more efficiency, right?
Is it a good thing for markets?
Hard for me to be the judge of that, I would say.
For us, you're right.
We sit somewhere in the middle, and I think the onus or the responsibility is to look
across both ways, right?
We want to be positioned in a way to capitalize on non-fundamental dislocations and lean into
duration, right?
So when those set-up dynamics are tricky or complicated, and everyone's lined up one
way, I want to line up the other way, right?
And I have the duration and the capital base to do that, and so that's, I think, we've
always said that duration is our single biggest advantage, but it's never felt more prominent
and powerful than it is in today's market structure.
Having said that, sometimes there are tricky things in the short term.
There's a data point that we feel like the market hasn't fully absorbed.
There's a risk factor in the short term, where there's an investment cycle coming on
something we love on a three- or four- or five-year look, but we might be sized differently
going into that event.
Doesn't mean we're going to go in and out of positions.
We rarely would do that, but we might be positioned differently.
And I think the other thing I should have mentioned earlier in terms of just the difference of
today versus before is, and this comes through at the portfolio level, is we are definitely
running lower gross exposure as a firm than we did for the first probably 15 to 17 years
of our existence as in deference to this dynamic, right?
So we want room to be adding to things when we think there are non-fundamental reactions
that don't make sense or overreactions to things that we think aren't that big a deal,
right?
For the first bunch of years of our existence, we ran more like 170 by 200 gross, and we've
been consistently, for the last, you know, six to eight years, we've been running more
kind of 150 by 180 gross to give ourselves that room to breathe so that we cannot have
to play defense at the wrong time, and it can actually lean in when everyone's leaning
out and vice versa.
People that really love investing, and I know you're one of them, seem to get the most
excited during periods of extreme change.
We were talking before we hit record about mobile being, you know, less like massive
things just up into the world, and now we're living through another one that might be the
biggest one that any of us ever see in our careers.
What's that like for you?
Like it would be one thing if you were just starting into this, but you're managing a
big existing thing, a big pool of capital, and probably expressing a lot of what you're
learning about the world through some of the biggest companies in the world, not necessarily
through like early stage startups or something.
What is that like?
Just talking through what it's been like so far to process this.
This makes us kind of giddy, being kind of like geek out for a second.
When I think about why did I get into this field in the first place, I think there's
two sort of defining characteristics that I have that position me well to do this job.
One is that I'm a wildly competitive human being.
I was a junior tennis player of my entire junior career before going to college.
I played in college.
I love to compete.
I love a scorecard, right?
That's just who I am as a human.
The second is that I'm an incredibly curious person who is very focused on growth and growth
in lots of ways.
I mean growth in terms of learning about new things, challenging myself.
I play instruments.
There's lots of things I'm interested in as a human.
This is, I feel so lucky to have found a career where I get to actually learn a lot and then
put that knowledge to the test by measurement.
We can make a capital behind those learnings and those insights and see if we're right
because there's a weighing mechanism every day that gives us a scorecard.
For me, the opportunity to do that at scale on a topic that is, I think, transformational
not just for the markets but for society is just intoxicating, honestly, as an ocean,
as a concept, and the fact that we can do a tremendous amount of fundamental research
and also have the flexibility, the capital-based, the nimbleness to evolve our views as we learn
is incredibly interesting.
It's also really fun as a manager to have a team of incredibly talented people who are
both just professionally and personally engaged in this topic and so the amount of trial and
error and the amount of testing that's going on on the weekends by our analysts who are
downloading all these products and sharing through to the email distribution system,
their learnings to help inform how we're thinking about just what's happening because things
are changing so quickly and there's so much dynamism around this topic is incredibly interesting.
The flip side of that is I've seen a lot of bubbles in my career and so there's the
appropriate amount of skepticism around where will the profit pools evolve and that's an
ongoing live conversation inside of our firm and everyone's got different opinions and
over what time frame and where is their fake AI and where is their real AI and where is
the value ultimately going to be created and harvested and realized and so we debate
that constantly and I would tell you that we think different things today than we thought
three months ago, six months ago and 12 months ago and they will be different, I can assure
you from what we will think in three months, six months, 12 months and so that level of
change and dynamism just as an investor is gold, I mean that's why we do this, right?
Maybe drill into that, like what do you think today is the most important place that winners
will emerge?
Like based on what you know, obviously it's a bunch of tons of change but like this is
what's fun to talk about.
I mean, you've had people on this podcast who are far more informed on this topic so
I feel humbled by even attempting to answer the question but I would say at a high level,
you know, obviously we have been of the view or questioning of the view from the beginning,
I would say to stepping back that LLMs would not be where the value was ultimately probably
largely created and that the fact that there are six, seven, eight of these today would
likely consolidate over time down to a few and so our view going back really from the
beginning was that probably most of the value would be created at the application layer,
right?
And so that's part of why we have such a large position in meta and have for the last bunch
of years as we feel like that's the most real life example at scale of commercializing a
lot of the capabilities in core products today, right, and you can see it kind of in their
results and they're talking to you about it when they speak on their calls and so forth.
However, there aren't a lot of opportunities yet to realize that in the public market to
think a lot of those businesses are first probably being funded in the private markets
right now or in the last handful of years in the same way that when the mobile transition
happened and the iPhone came out, the Spotify's and Shopify's and DoorDash's and all these
amazing companies that came out of that generation of startups came after, right?
And so those generations of cohorts of companies I'm sure are being formed and have been formed
in the last couple of years, we don't invest typically at that stage in the private market
and certainly many of them are not public yet.
And so our positioning has been more really around picks and shovels with the view that
like let's see how the ecosystem evolves, let's see where profit pools are going to be
created over time, but in the meantime what we do know is that there are constraints
and what those constraints are shifting obviously they started on the semi side, now it's more
on the power side, the next piece we'll see where that goes to and so that's more what
we're tracking, right?
In terms of where are the constraints, where are the profit pools being generated that
we believe are sustainable that are not a function of supply, demand, dislocation and
then how do we want to be positioned behind those, right?
And so that's the framework that we've kind of used when obviously we're doing an incredible
amount of research speaking with as many people as we can in every part of the ecosystem to
inform obviously the inputs to that thought process.
I'm curious about it.
Just the literal machinery of the firm, so like how many analysts are there?
What do they do?
How does that feed into something else?
What do you do on top of it?
How do you size stuff?
How do you do leverage?
Like just like literally like the assembly line that ends in a finished product that is
a portfolio.
So we have currently 15 people on the research team inclusive of Steve and Dave and me.
And interestingly, in the 19 years I've been at the firm, we've been sort of between 13
and 19 and that's sort of where we live in terms of team size with the view that more
people is not necessarily better.
We want to run a relatively concentrated portfolio of 25 to 30 longs.
That's kind of a best ideas portfolio and we want a lot of collaboration.
And so we want everyone to fit around a table to have a conversation at our research meetings
and be a part of the conversation.
And when you start to get into 20s and 30s, then you have a very siloed research team and
we know that's not sort of how we're oriented and culturally not how we work.
How it works is, and maybe the best way to start is sort of how someone gets ingested
into the firm on the research team, right?
So a new person joins, typically they're younger, 25 to 30, let's say, and come with some level
of experience and they've got the analytical toolkit built already somewhere else, sometimes
in private equity, sometimes in banking, sometimes in business school.
And typically they apprentice with someone senior for some period of time.
That can be six months, it could be two years.
And they will kind of co-cover a bunch of things together.
And that person is not doing what we call like the grunt work.
They are going soup to nuts from being on the calls, working on the models, going to
the conferences, going to see the companies, being in all of our meetings.
And what we find is that person's voice tends to start to get louder after kind of six,
eight months, right?
Because they've been around, they've seen how we work.
They're asking questions, they're iterating, they're learning from other analysts.
And when I know it's time for them to sort of spin out and cover their own stuff is when
they start disagreeing with the person that they're apprenticing with, right?
And so, which is to me like, well, you found your voice, amazing.
And now let's put you on a bunch of other stuff that you can just run after and then
serve up to us, basically.
And so that's how people get sort of absorbed into the culture and see how we work.
At that point, obviously, they have an appreciation for our process, how we approach companies,
how we talk to companies, how we conduct research.
And maybe segueing to that part of how the sausage gets made.
We're doing all the things, I think a lot of fundamental research firms are doing.
We're reading all the public filings, we're reading all the transcripts, we're listening
to podcasts, we're going to conferences, we're doing a lot of deep channel work in terms
of talking to partners and former employees, we're talking to people and the expert networks,
we're reaching out to our own network as an institution.
27 years later, having done a lot of investing globally, we have a lot of people who we talk
to, who are former CEOs, former board members, who have a lot of thoughts because they're
still pretty connected to the spaces in which they worked.
And so we are leveraging all of those resources on a fundamental basis and then we have a
three person data team.
And the data team's role is a couple of different things.
They are our interface with third party vendors on the outside and internally with our research
team.
They sit on every single meeting, they know what we're working on, what's in the pipeline,
and they are bringing external resources to bear to say, we're trying to answer these
three questions on X stock or X sector, these are the resources that we think can be helpful
in helping you answer those questions from a data perspective, right?
So they are another tool in the kit in terms of how to approach market research.
And they work really closely with our analysts to help them solve problems.
That's a newer capability in the last call it four or five years, I think has been super
additive to how we work.
The occasionally will call out something that they're seeing in various data sets that
we get in terms of like something funky's happening this, you may want to look into this,
but that's really less of the role they play.
They're really there to be a supportive arm for fundamental research and answering key
questions.
That's just sort of how the ideas get generated, researched process.
We as an organization meet two days a week, Mondays and Thursdays.
The Monday meeting is a new ideas meeting and a portfolio updates meeting.
So we're buying this stock, here's the thesis.
At that point it's not news to anybody because we've talked about it probably in a research
meeting many times before or it's, you know, we're selling this and here's why or I met
with this company, so just updates.
Thursday is a couple different formats.
It's either spaghetti against the wall ideas like what are people hearing, we're just coming
out of earnings.
What are you hearing, what's interesting, you know, what are people excited about?
That's one.
Two is what are things that have generated meaningful like outsized alpha or massively
underperformed on a trailing 90 day basis and those get served up, you know, every week
for us to consider and we pick one or two to review or three, something that's pretty
far along in the pipeline of being worked on and we're thinking about actually beginning
to transact in it and we want to kind of surface it to the group and debate it.
So that's the Thursday meeting.
So again, all of this conversation is meant to foster dialogue, debate, like people sharing
their points of view, asking hard questions, pushing each other.
That's the essence of sort of our process, right?
And then when we're ready to transact, it's, you know, collaboration with the trading desk,
which has five people on it, to your resources question.
And the questions there are, you know, what is max position size, liquidity, you know,
we've already had the conversation as a PM group and with the analysts around like,
you know, how does this compare to the rest of the portfolio, what's the, you know, what's
the IRR, we've gone through the numbers, how does it, you know, price target, one year
price target, three year price target, what are the near term factors we want to be thinking
about if any, so that's all the conversation that's happening before we actually begin
to put an order in.
So that's sort of the sort of the upward flow of ideas and research and like structure
of how we do things.
The other thing that happens on Mondays is, and this is all day Monday, is that Dave
and I have sector meetings with all of the teams, every, on every other week basis.
That meeting is everything from what are you working on, what are you trying to figure
out, what resources are we deploying to help figure out those questions, to its earnings,
who's reporting this week, what are we expecting to hear, what would make us sell, what would
make us add, what could surprise the market, either way kind of thing.
So that's on Mondays, that's sort of the structure of how we work as a team.
And the portfolio is helped, I think, by something additionally new, which is we have
a risk function now that we didn't have going back, you know, five or seven years ago, which
is somebody who used to run our fund to funds, which we had back in the day and shut down
a number of years ago, who has built an incredible expertise and knowledge base around studying
managers.
And so when we shut down our fund to funds, we said to him, "Frank, why don't you come
study us and help us get better?"
And so he's gone back using a lot of the new tools that we referenced earlier to think
about, you know, where do we get ourselves in trouble, where have we made a lot of money
helping us understand the mistakes we make, what are the patterns around those mistakes,
what are the patterns around the huge successes?
How do we trade?
Do we add value by trading?
I mean, all these things that are sort of portfolio analytics.
And then also, he's sort of our external lens on factors and, you know, all the things
that we have to talk about now that we're never a thing in the parlance of running
a fund 10 or 15 years ago, but that, you know, are, again, never prescriptive, but another
set of tools in the kit.
And he is sort of the where that resides.
And so we meet with him and the risk team periodically and are getting reports sort of
constantly to make sure we're thinking about, gee, there's a bunch of unearned alpha and
these three names, you know, the multiple has just gone from 15 to 25 times, like, do
we still love it here?
Should we be trimming it?
Right?
So again, never prescriptively, but just another set of prompts and tools to think about,
you know, balance in the book and where returns are coming from and how the composition is
evolving.
As you approach this whole thing, I'm curious if there is a fixed or fixed-ish investment
philosophy that has always guided you, that you feel like no matter what happens, even
in rapid pace of change will continue to guide you.
Like, is there something that's unchanging about the philosophy and maybe just like articulate
your thoughts?
Sure.
I mean, I don't think we have a guiding principle around it.
I would say the way that we discuss it internally is how much exposure do we want to this theme.
And I think what's challenging about this one is it cuts across a number of different
things, right?
There are companies that are not leaning into this technology that are not benefiting from
the proliferation of this technology today who will and who are probably uniquely positioned.
There are others who are, you know, in the AIs of problem for their business category,
right?
There's several industries that would fall into that camp.
I think we keep having the conversation of how much exposure do we want because there's
a recognition, like we saw in the evaluation bubble bursting of late 2122, that there
are nuanced bets here that are distinct, but that if there's a problem in AI, so to
speak, and we can define what that may look like, these are all going to trade like one
stock, right?
And so what is the drawdown we are willing to sustain or endure if and when that happens,
right?
And so that's, I think, the risk framework on top of this is the most exciting dynamic
thing and we can all, you know, talk for hours and hours and days about all the opportunities
it's going to create and that I think there, not a thing is a straight line, right?
And so I think there's the, this is the benefit of having done this for a long time, is that
there's, it's two steps forward, one step back, right?
And so the deep-seak thing last week was interesting, right, in terms of being like,
"Oh, whoa, what is this and what does this mean and what does this mean for the lens?
Did they have access to GPUs?
Like, what do we know?
What do we not know?"
Right?
And I think we're still trying to answer those questions.
And I think there was a knee-jerk reaction from the market.
We will have more of these, right?
That is just part of this.
And so that's not our reason to not be involved, but it does make you think about sizing.
And we always want some measure of balance in our portfolio and we want several things
that we're excited about that have idiosyncratic drivers that some of which may be tied to
AI, some of many of which are not, right?
And there are many thematics in our portfolio that we're super excited about and our job
is to be thoughtful about portfolio construction and make sure that all of our eggs are on
one basket are things that we believe are discrete bets then ultimately trade like one,
right?
And so that's part of our challenge.
Another way to think about it is there are certain investors that I would argue are playing
a different game and there are certain investors that are playing the popular game best, right?
Like, there's sort of competitors in an existing game.
Where do you think Lone Pine falls in that spectrum?
It's a really good question.
We're in the middle and I think we want ultimately the flexibility to pivot, right?
I think that's what we've learned and experienced over doing this for a long time is that there
are certain market backdrops that are conducive to certain styles of investing where you want
to be more concentrated.
There are certain, you know, backdrops where you want to be less concentrated.
There are times to go big on a bet when we feel like it's really underappreciated.
There's times to recognize that a lot of work's excited about the world's excited about.
And so you probably shouldn't be as big as we were.
And so the, I would say, the flexibility to recognize when we're in a very short-term
oriented market or when there's duration, right?
And part of that and I think one of the things that's changed is if I were on the clock to
10 or 15 years ago sitting in our research room and around internal meetings, we didn't
talk about macro at all.
Like it was just like we're fundamental investors, you know, we are focused on what's happening
inside of sectors, who's winning, who's losing, who are the best teams, who's executing.
And to do that in 2025 and ignore macro is not possible.
So I want to be clear, macro is not prescriptive in terms of what we do, but it is a tool in
the kit and something that has to be considered.
And so there are moments in time when it feels like the market is extending in duration
and then we can reflect some of that and how we're positioned and how we're constructing
the portfolio and how we're sized and certain things.
And there's times and I would argue that we're in one of them right now where there's a lot
of uncertainty and appropriately so, right?
And so the market is, it feels much more short-term oriented, much more data point-driven.
You know, the tariff thing over the weekend is a good example and there's a bunch of announcements
and then some of that gets walked back on Monday.
And so how does this all get implemented and executed I think is an open question.
And so in that type of environment, you're going to see more knee-jerky type reactions
to things.
And that's just an awareness, we're not going to radically alter what we're doing or how
we're positioned, but it just sort of focuses us in different ways.
Can you, maybe the tariffs is a perfect excuse because it's sort of like happened and then
unhappened, you know, very quickly.
Or maybe unhappened.
Yeah, maybe unhappened, who knows.
But it's like a live thing.
Just bring us into the room as much as you can on, okay, the announcement comes out, like
what literally happens at Lone Pine, like who is talking to who about what, in what
settings leading to what decisions like, like give us like a super zoomed in example here
of how you process some big piece of news.
So we all see the news starting to come out towards the end of last week.
And over the weekend, Dave, my co-CIO and I, who I also refer to as my work husband,
we've worked together for 21 years, so a long time.
We're emailing back and forth, like, okay, so now what do we do, right?
Like this is, these are big announcements.
These are big numbers.
We start to see the responses from some other countries in terms of what they're saying.
I mean, to be totally frank, the conversation's like, I'm not really sure what we're supposed
to do about this.
I mean, like, we're going to like radically alter our portfolio, I mean, is this even
going to go through?
What's going to happen on Monday, right?
And we are in a moment right now of obviously very elevated or in an announcement cycle that
seems to be accelerating with pace, right?
And so we sort of had a back and forth a few times over the weekend, okay, does this change
anything for us?
Let's come in Monday and see what happens.
So Monday morning, we sit down as a PM group every Monday and every Thursday, and we're
talking obviously all the time, and Steve joins that meeting, and we sort of went back
and forth and said, okay, what does this mean?
What are the industries that are, let's assume it goes through, let's play this out both
ways, right?
Let's assume it goes through, what are the industries that are, this is a huge problem
for, and we sort of take through what some of those are, autos and others, right?
What will the retaliatory actions look like?
Probably.
And then the other side is like, let's assume that this all gets walked back, right?
And how much it's going to get, and things are trading at crazy levels in the pre-market
on Monday morning, right?
That are theoretically exposed to these level of tariffs.
We walk through that.
And so the net of that is a lot of conversation and decision to do nothing.
I mean, literally zero orders came out of this conversation, right?
And that's not uncommon, but like for an event in a news cycle that is meaningful and somewhat
anticipated, I would argue, and also I think with the approach with the appropriate amount
of skepticism in terms of what ultimately gets implemented, a lot of debate, not doing
anything about it, right?
And so I think it's a conversation that's live, right?
And so I don't want to like all of this, you know, all the AI stuff, these are all very
live conversations that, you know, live inside of meetings, but are constantly being, you
know, pushed forward via email and constant communication that we're all in.
So this one, I would say, is consternation, what are we supposed to do about it?
Not going to react?
Live and learn.
Like, let's keep, let's keep falling.
What is it that gives you personally the energy?
Is it discovery?
Is it a sense of understanding?
Is it a great company?
A great product?
A great mispricing?
What is the thing that, like, is your fuel or energy source searching for?
So it's some combination, I would say, for us, a lot of our process revolves around
people.
Yeah.
So it's the people who are running the businesses.
And I think that companies are, in some ways, like families, there's a very distinct culture
that characterizes and underpins companies, and that matters immensely, I think, for how
a company operates, functions, hires, retains, grows, invests, all of the things that drive
sort of ultimately how they perform and execute.
And so getting to know the people, what motivates them, are they looking around corners and thinking
about the thing that can disrupt them?
Are they trying to disrupt themselves?
Are they attracting and empowering the people that they are hiring into their companies
and retaining them by giving them a lot of responsibility and a lot of autonomy and a
lot of voice and decision-making?
So I think that's where it starts for us.
And one of our favorite themes in investing, which is not a sectoral theme, but sort of
a change theme, is around new people, right?
You change people, you change a company.
And so there are lots of examples of, in our history, of businesses that are good to great
businesses that we feel have been under managed, and then somebody comes in who we know from
a prior life or a prior existence, or we do a bunch of work on that person if we don't
and get super excited about their ability to transform.
And to me, Nirvana is when you have a company that is so deficient in a certain functional
area, and then you bring in a leader who is an expert in that functional area, and it's
like, that's magic.
And we've seen this a bunch of times.
And so those opportunities I think are super interesting.
Two, I would say, is just companies who are innovating at such a rapid clip, and you
see what's happening from a product pipeline perspective, right?
They have a great monopoly incumbent business, ideally, right?
Or something that has incredible unit economics, and they are using a lot of that profit and
power to invest and plant seeds in a bunch of other areas.
And you see some of those seeds starting to come to fruition in terms of new products,
new lines of business, new distribution channels, whatever it may be relative to the company
we're talking about, and seeing that secret sauce is not just the single thing that made
them great, but their ability to then recreate and innovate at scale, I think is super exciting
to us.
Is something like Starbucks the perfect example of the first thing you said, where it's sort
of this story that people are worried about, skeptical about, there's things going wrong,
and then I don't know him, but by all accounts, the new CEO is like some mega all-star person.
So is that like the kind of general gist of the--
It's a very good example.
Another one from our past, which we did really well with, and which was a great example of
this was Ulta, when Mary Dillon took it over.
This was at the time a small company, I think it was maybe the three-year-ish billion-dollar
market cap when she joined, and she was a consumer products expert, marketing expert,
and this was a largely membership loyalty-driven business around cosmetics, where almost the
entire employee-based female that had great product curation, but not a great culture
inside the company and really hadn't built a great marketing muscle.
And she came in and added all of that to the formula and the new economics of the business.
They always had great four walls as a retailer, but really added something different to sort
of the go-to-market and the proposition to the customer and how the company was run,
who she hired, and that's a great example of a very strong business that could even
be managed even better by somebody who added the expertise that they had.
How did you know, in her case as an example, is it kind of arm's length?
Are you spending the last time with her direct one-on-one?
So we knew her because, again, we track people.
We follow people who we think are great, and when we owned McDonald's, many years ago,
she was a CMO.
So I met her for the first time at a meeting at corporate headquarters, where they roll
in five or six different executives, and she came in, and I didn't know who she was,
and she spoke for an answer to a bunch of questions and was super thoughtful and insightful,
and she walked out, and I was like, "Who was this person?"
And I like googled her and saw her background, and she was used to work in CPG, which tends
to be great training ground for analytical thinkers.
And then we kind of followed her, and I knew Ulta, and we were sort of dazzled by their
four wall unit economics and done a bunch of work on the company, but the execution had
been uneven, I would say, prior to her arrival, and there were things we thought were missing
in terms of sort of how the business was being run, and so when the board announced
her hiring, we were like, "Oh my God, this is kind of perfect," because she's exactly
the right leader for the opportunity that this company has, and has the right skills
to kind of really lift what's happening here.
What would be the other end of the spectrum, like a buffet ham sandwich business?
Not to pick on them, but these are MasterCard, where the business model is just so ridiculously
good.
Good.
Right.
I'm sure they're awesome.
I don't know them either, but you never hear about people of these are MasterCard.
It's not like a cult of personality.
It's like, we just have the best business.
How do you process something like that with your people's centricity?
How do you think about a business that's just so damn good?
You probably still want to buy a portfolio.
There always has to be room for them in the portfolio, because those are the great compounding
businesses.
I mean, we owned both those companies at their IPOs, and had meaningful positions, and with
the benefit of hindsight, never should have sold, and they would have gone to very large
positions over time, so of course it would have trimmed, but look, that's why a portfolio
was such an interesting entity, because it's a balance of a lot of different things, and
so the people thing is hugely important for us, and we always want to know who we're lined
up with and what their incentives are and all the things I mentioned, but there's also
a lot of room for owning just fantastic businesses that to your point, whether you have an A-plus
CEO or an A-minus, I'm not sure it really matters that much on the margin, we just want
to make sure we're not paying too much for them, right?
So that's, I think, always the key to, and no situations as we want to own a stable of
great businesses, particularly when there's a moment of dislocation or a question of doubt
about something or there's a perception of a competitive threat that we think is sort
of being overplayed in the market, those often give us the opportunity to own great
businesses at more reasonable prices, but those, I think, are really about understanding
the internals of the business and what drives the business and the duration of what we think
the opportunity set looks like for that business to just own them, right, and those are a different
flavor.
So interesting is the idea of following people applies to you, too.
You're in the midst of a big succession and it's so interesting because in this business,
you can count on kind of a few hands, the number of really successful transitions that
have happened at firms like yours that are less like big industrial complexes and more
like small teams, what works, what has worked, what's been hard like the degree to which
you're willing to kind of share the nitty gritty detail of it, good, bad and ugly, I'm
curious how it's gone and how you've thought about it.
So look, it starts with Steve, our founder and how he set the firm up when he started
it, you know, 27 years ago, which was with an orientation to succession.
I think that's the first really differentiating aspect of our company versus many of our peers
is that he was focused from the beginning on the company outliving him and, you know,
he comes out of the Goldman Sachs partnership back in the day and I think that was in many
ways the model and his brain of like, you know, you do well, you rise up, you own a lot
of the company and then ultimately as partners, you know, go limited in the case of Goldman
or you start to give away your equity to the next generation, right, and that's what his
vision was and that by the way, extends not just to the investment team but to the entire
company.
You know, it is the responsibility of every functional leader in our company, whether you
run the tax department, HR, or IT, to understand and be mentoring who your successor is, right,
and that's the culture of the firm and has been from the beginning.
And so Steve has been steadily handing off portfolio responsibility by sector kind of
within the first couple of years of launching the firm with the view that there will be
moments where it is clear that there are certain people on our investment team who know more
about this sector than I do, who are effectively making all of the decisions anyway and so
let's deputize them to actually make those decisions, right, and have the insights.
And so that's been the culture of since the beginning, you know, what we have been doing
with, you know, him officially stepping back to really just kind of a chairman type of
role and Dave and I taking over as co-CIOs was to really transition what we call kind
of a 2.0 of long pine.
And that's been, if I'm being honest, a heavy lift, right, because, and that is a function
to some extent of, you know, how we were set up at the beginning and then how much the
market has changed, right?
We had a great group of investors who were with us from day one who were largely kind of
North American endowments and foundations and some high net worth, you know, family
house to us, family office types and high net worth people and they gave us money day
one and they just compounded for a long time.
And so our orientation was heads down, put up numbers.
We didn't really have an outbound effort and nor were we open for the first almost 15
years of our existence, right?
We didn't really launch a bunch of new products after the long only launch in 2004.
We had a quick stint with a long only emerging markets product that we quickly realized
didn't scale and we folded that into our long only business and haven't really come
up with a new product since then.
And so there really wasn't a need to have a big outbound effort, right?
And so we've always had an investor services effort, which is great, but that's one example.
Two is, you know, the emergence of a lot of technology and a lot of products and capability.
We built all our systems homegrown because when we launched in 1997, a lot of this stuff
didn't exist.
That was off the shelf, right?
And so there's been an opportunity to modernize how we do things from a process for
perspective, I think, across a lot of different parts of the organization.
Three, I think, given the nature of collaboration that we talked about earlier with regard to
sector coverage and how we work together, that's a slightly different human in terms
of who's going to be good in that type of role and who succeeds, who communicates really
well.
There's always obviously a premium on communication in our industry and the ability to synthesize
a lot of information into a couple of key questions.
The people who are collaborative, who are really team-oriented, who are creative in
terms of, you know, tools they employ to do fundamental research, the premium on those
is even higher, I would argue, than it was before.
And so I think we've evolved over time the types of people we've learned from who's really
succeeded inside of our culture and who hasn't done as well and tried to kind of evolve
how we think about the types that we want to bring into the organization.
Dave and I are very focused now on kind of the next generation, right?
You know, I'm 50, Dave's, I believe 54, maybe is 55, I'm not sure.
If I'm in this seat in 10 years, that's probably not the best outcome for our LPs,
right?
You know, there is, I think, a life cycle of doing this and Dave always says, and I think
this is right, you know, when I'm less excited to jump on the plane to Singapore for two days,
it's kind of how I know, right?
I'm still excited to jump on the plane to Singapore and so is he, so we're in the right
seats.
But we're equally focused on who is the next generation, how do we expose them to the things
they need to get, to get exposed to, you know, teach them how to manage people, how to think
about portfolio, how to learn the areas outside of the areas they cover, and that they've
grown up covering.
They've proven themselves to be very successful analysts, how do they make, how do we develop
them to become, you know, great portfolio managers, right?
And so that's a big part of our time now, which is different for me than probably five
years ago.
And then the last piece is obviously just shoring up the organization for a different
world, right?
You know, whether that means different, you know, strategies around products, we've had
a kind of a one size fits all, we are a long only firm, we are a long short firm.
What does that mean in 2025, right?
You know, what a hedge fund is or what it represents to the market in 1997 looks pretty
different than what that term means today.
Today, it probably means more like a pod shop, right?
That's what a hedge fund is, not we're a long short fund, right?
And a long only fund and we're fundamental investors and that means something different
in 2025 than it did in 1997.
We never had a PR effort.
We never had a website until a few years ago, right?
We wouldn't do things like this probably five or 10 years ago.
It wasn't the culture of the company, but the world's changed.
And so the onus is on us to communicate our story, communicate how we've changed, how
we've grown, what we've learned, how we've developed, what we're focused on, right?
And so that's a different orientation for a firm that culturally was set up to be let's
just perform and everything will take care of itself.
Yes, we absolutely need to perform.
That's jobs one, two, and three, but there's other things we need to be doing to continue
to develop and grow our business.
I would love to hear the very first time you remember feeling your competitive instinct
in your life, like going back as early in your life as possible.
My sister will laugh at this if she listens to this.
So I was probably six years old, and my parents belonged to a little pool club at our town,
and they played tennis, and I had started to play and didn't take lessons, and it wasn't
all it's like lessons until I was older.
But the way to be able to play on the backboard at our little pool club was there was competition.
Like you get the access to the backboard and you had to beat the people who were waiting
around to play on the backboard.
And so I figured this out and I'm watching these two boys who are I think like 10 or 11 play
each other and whoever wins gets to practice for 20 minutes and someone else the next person
gets to challenge them.
And so I'm like I'm a challenges person, right?
And so watching, like sitting waiting for my turn to play, like my heart rate just started
like escalating.
And I was not because I was nervous because I was excited.
And then I beat whoever I played and that moment of like winning and like internalizing
that I now had access for myself to the backboard for the next 20 minutes until the next person
was going to challenge me was something that made me feel very energized and excited and
a feeling that I wanted to replicate.
Has it always been excited?
Has it ever been nerves?
Sure, of course.
So when was it first nerves?
Oh, when expectation comes along, right?
When you realized you're actually good at something or could be good at something or
have potential, right?
And so.
Um, was that tennis too, for sure, right?
Because I think I was this height probably when I was 11 years old.
So I was, I had very high rankings when I was very young and that pressure of being seated
in a tournament, right?
You go to a tournament and you're the first seed and it's like everyone's gunning for
you.
Right?
That's anxiety provoking for sure.
Did you have experiences where you sort of broke through an understanding of what you're
capable of, like where something happened and on the other side of that thing, you like
almost like a snake shedding its skin or something like you up leveled your own assessment
of yourself that happened in competition?
Indirectly, yes.
I would say wasn't in a match or in a particular setting, but, um, I burned out in junior tennis.
So my, you know, I started playing nationals when I was 10 years old.
I played every summer until I went to college.
Most weekends were spent traveling to tournaments around the Tri-State area, Thanksgiving, Easter
Bowl, every summer, like it was a lot.
And I think they've since scaled back, like they don't, I don't think they have the tenant
under category anymore, but they did that.
And when I got to my junior year, the end of my junior year of high school, I was just,
I was done.
I was just, was so burned out, I didn't really want to practice for three hours every day
after school.
I was interested in other things.
I was interested in school.
And at the time, um, the NCAA rules for tennis, I'm not sure if they changed, 'cause
now they're different.
I feel like for every sport, but coaches weren't allowed to call you until July 1st of your
junior summer.
Right.
And I'll date myself by saying that we had an answering machine with it, with a cassette
at the time.
And so I didn't want to go to nationals that summer, and I said to my mom, like, I'm
just done.
I don't want to go.
I just, I'm done with the sport.
Like I can't play anymore.
I don't want to do this.
And she said, I've never made you do anything in your entire life, but I'm actually going
to make you go.
Because you've worked so hard for the last 10 years at this sport, and you spend so much
time and put so much of yourself into it, let it do something for you.
It's going to get you into college, and if you never want to play again, that's fine.
But like, I'm going to make you go.
And I went, and I kicking and screaming, but I did, I went, and I played, and I got home
from the tournaments, and you know, our cassette tape was broken from all the coaches that
had left messages for super exciting.
And then I literally did not pick up a tennis racket for my entire senior year of high school.
I applied to Harvard early.
I was lucky enough to get in.
I got recruited, and I played basketball for my high school and softball for my high
school because I love sports and I love to compete.
And I went to college with a very different orientation, which was, well, see how this
goes, right?
Like, I don't know how I'm going to play.
I don't know how I'm going to feel.
How being on a team is going to feel relative to being such an individual sport.
And it's a great story for me about just seeing something different from an experience, which
was, it really became about the team.
Like, my freshman year, we were terrible.
I played first singles.
We were last in the Ivy League.
I lost most matches that I played, so as did we as a team.
And it really became about rebuilding the team and the camaraderie of the people on
it that provided me such, like, enjoyment and so much fun and such an important part
of my college experience.
And so tennis became, for me, something very different in college.
I didn't think was possible.
And so I saw the opportunity to reshape something for myself that was so seminal and it becomes
so almost toxic by the time I was finishing high school to something that was such a gift
of, and some of my closest friends in the world came from that experience, my best friend
on the planet.
We met when we were seven.
She played at Yale.
I played at Harvard, you know.
So there's so many things tennis has given me and has shown me so much about kind of person
I want to be and taught me so many lessons about not just competing but independence
and hard work and all of the things that I would like to instill in my daughters come
from that experience and then allowing it to become something else for me.
I love that moment with your mom.
What was the kind of the same question, more investing centric?
What was the first formative experience you can remember that made you realize that both
the competition and the pursuit of excellence that you seem to care a lot about was possible
in this field?
You know, it's funny, like I think it takes a while in this field to figure out if you're
any good at it, right?
And so in the first handful of years that I worked in public markets, I definitely got
more things right than wrong.
But I wouldn't say I came out of that feeling like I got this, right?
When I got to Lone Pine, I was super excited about being in a culture of excellence and
a culture of research.
That was really what drew me to the firm and I knew Dave because we overlapped on a bunch
of investments and when I was in prior firms, we shared meetings and wanted to see companies
together and really got to know each other and figured out that we thought about the
world in a pretty similar way and we're attracted to the same types of industries and companies.
When I got to Lone Pine, I worked a lot with him and Steve was obviously sort of this super
impressive figure who loomed large over the research department given, obviously his tenure
and his success.
And about a year into being at Lone Pine, the person who had been working most closely
with him on consumer left the firm to start his own firm and Steve comes into my office
and he says, "All right, so you're taking over all this, all this stuff, retail, luxury,
all the hotels, casinos, all these things and we've been working mostly with me."
And I was like, "Okay, this is super exciting and super intimidating."
And I remember a few years into working with him, there was something, I forget, I think
it was the gap, Glenn Murphy was running it and he was in the process of turning it around
at the time and I'd done a bunch of work on it.
It was a pretty controversial idea because people thought the gap was sort of a mature
business and the brands were all starting to lose market share and so forth.
And I went into his office and the way things work with Steve when he used to be a portfolio
manager was, it was sort of a conversation.
There wasn't a memo, there wasn't a deck that you put together and presented to an investment
committee.
You'd go into his office and say, "Hey, I want to talk to you about X."
And he'd sit down and kind of hash it out and then usually if you're effective you walk
out and like he puts the order in, right, just turns around at his little desk and puts
the order in.
And so I go once and talk to him about the gap and I said, "Hey, I want to talk to you
about the gap."
He's like, "Is it short?"
Right?
And I was like, "I actually think it's pretty interesting."
And he's like, "He makes a face, like, are you crazy?"
And so I walk him through my thinking and he's like, "Ask me a bunch of questions."
And it's like 20, 30 minute conversation at the end, he looks at me and he's like, "Yeah,
that makes sense."
And I just write to her and I was like, "Okay, maybe I actually know something because he
knows more about this whole space than anybody on the planet in our world who's living and
investing actively at that moment in time in the public markets."
And like, I just convinced him and it ended up being right, which was great.
But more importantly, I think just the confidence to come in and take the other side on something
against somebody who I had so much respect for and then be right in that name was just
like a tiny example, but I think illustrative of how this job is so much about confidence
and how you're feeling and it's cumulative, right?
And so yes, I'd had success, but that moment was sort of stands out in my brain and I joke
internally at Lone Pine and I say this with intent and intention because I want the analysts
to challenge us all the time, that's how we all get better, is like I kind of made a
career of disagreeing with Steve, right?
And like, look where I'm sitting now, it's like I think it kind of worked out, I want
you to do the same, right?
That's so cool.
If you think about the leader, business leader, that is the most driven to win that you've
ever gotten to know about or know personally well, who comes to mind, I want to pull apart
like the pieces of drive to win and then apply it to the people that, you know, on your
team and also that you recruit.
I mean, it's probably Mark Zuckerberg.
And what do you see?
Like, what does that teach you?
Like, what is it?
Huge focus, big bets, willing to be wrong and pivot quickly when realizing that they
are wrong.
Meta.
It's having, knowing when to be bold and when to be humble, attracting, challenging, you
know, motivating a really talented organization and vulnerability.
And when you think about all those characteristics, how do you suss them out in someone that might
come work for you, especially if they're young and like, they're not like, I say all
the time that, you know, what I can glean from a 30 minute interview is pretty limited
in terms of someone's ultimate ability to do this job well.
So that's what we have a summer internship program for MBAs because it gives us kind of
eight to 10 weeks to evaluate them and vice versa, right?
To figure out if there's a fit, how this person works, how they think.
So for me, I look for a couple of things.
It won't surprise you to hear that I love hiring competitive athletes who have competed
at a high level.
I don't care the sport, it could be an instrument.
That's great too.
But people who understand hard work, failure, disappointment, achievement, what that all
feels like to people who have had to juggle things in their lives, right?
So they had to work a couple of jobs while they were in college.
They had some sort of misfortune in their life, you know, a relative, a sibling or something
that's happened to them that they've had to pick themselves up and work through.
People who are interested in lots of things because they're curious, right?
People who love to learn.
That is ultimately, we said this earlier, like foundational, I think, for being successful
on this job is never being complacent in thinking that you know more.
But recognizing and being humbled by the fact that there's always more work you can do.
But the companion skill to that is knowing when you know enough to make a decision, right?
Because I think you can get into, you know, analytical paralysis around like there's more
to do, there's more to do, there's more to do, and like we're in the decision-making
business, right?
And so that balance of curiosity and pursuit of knowledge and learning and growth, the self-awareness
to admit when one is wrong, which is an incredibly important part of what we do, and the willingness
to take some level of risk or offer some kind of contrarian thinking that often can position
us really well to make money, so.
Who do you view as your competition?
Is it firms?
Is it just the whole market, is it?
It's so funny because the firms that we're always lined up against in the press are some
of my closest friends, and none of us view it competitively at all.
In fact, several former guests on your show are super close friends of mine, and in some
ways I view our competition honestly as ourselves.
Like we need to be better and do better, and I think that's the bar we hold ourselves
to is that we, you know, have the unique position of having been around for 27 years, which
is increasingly rare in what we do, and obviously being a directional, fundamentally oriented
public equities firm with duration is increasingly rare at scale, I would say, relative to when
I first started in the business.
And so I don't think of the pods as our competition.
I mean, the market is obviously we're benchmarked in one of our products, and so that's obviously
our competition and how we evaluate ourselves, but I think we had many years of very, very
strong performance.
We're sort of hopefully back on that track now with, I think, a lot of learnings and
a lot of insights from mistakes we've made and a lot of growth that we've all experienced
as an organization, and so I don't have like a target on my wall of XYZ firm or someone's
numbers that I'm tracking to say, oh, we did better than that person.
It's actually sort of the opposite, which might be counterintuitive, is that I root
for a lot of my friends, and when we do work on something and someone else calls us and
they own it or they do work on it, we pass and it works and they do well.
I think that's awesome, right?
We want the industry to do well.
We want people who leave our firm and start their own firm to do well.
That is good for the industry, right?
And that matters.
And so I don't have a zero-sum game attitude towards our industry or root against certain
people.
I really don't.
Having done this for a long time, part of what makes us really fun is the relationships
of 20-plus years of going to see companies with the same people and exchanging ideas
and debating ideas and challenging each other on our thinking and then getting to know their
talent, people who work for them, who've done the deep dives on a bunch of different
names and introducing them to our talent and all of us getting on Zooms and hashing it
out.
That's what's really fun about doing this job, is that network?
That has surprised me, I think, when I first entered the industry many years ago, I thought
it would be more sharp elbow and competitive and instead it's been the exact opposite.
And maybe it starts with how we were talking earlier about sector coverage and my initial
peer network being outside of the firm.
So you sort of find like-minded thinkers or people that you respect or who you think
ask good questions and meetings with companies to then have conversations with about the
sector and then that grows up into, you know, these become friends.
So that's been a real surprise, I would say, about the industry and maybe a little bit
of a wonder from the question that you asked, but it's one thing I think is super interesting
and maybe not really well understood outside in.
I'm curious how much more or less you feel like leadership matters than early on in your
career.
Like a couple of the examples you've given is that a single person can really massively
alter the trajectory of a business, even a very established one with lots of features
that are independent of the person.
There's the like great person theory of history versus the sort of, you know, less emphasis
on the individual.
Has the point on that spectrum that you personally lie changed over time, like do you believe
more or less in leadership, I guess?
More.
More just because I've seen so many reps, right?
That's the business.
We're in the pattern recognition business as a field, I would say.
And what's also interesting is to see it across industries, across geography is like, you
know, we used to be big investors in China many years ago and seeing how a lot of the
entrepreneurial businesses there, the Tencent, Sally Bob, has got built and the leadership
inside of those companies may twan.
I look at something like Mercado Libre and what Marcos has built there over time and
the team largely being the same since inception and like they've executed against competitors
who came in and tried to disrupt their markets were much bigger, you know, well resourced,
much bigger global companies and defeated them and I just, there's something to the
magic that happens when you have, I think, strong leadership, great teams, you know, a
lot of collaboration across those teams and a lot of like ups and downs that everyone
experiences together that creates so much resilience.
I just, I've seen that play out time and time again and it, you know, it's interesting
in today's actually investing climate with, we've been saying a lot like with the cost
of capital coming back and largely going to persist, we can debate at what level, you're
seeing just winners and losers across industries in ways that we have not seen for a really
long time which is super exciting obviously for us as, you know, really actively engage
research oriented investors who both own stocks and short stocks because execution is
mattering, right? And the free lunch of the zero interest rates and there's money for
everyone, almost forever it felt like for many, many years, that year is over and so
you see it across all kinds of categories and you see, you know, whether it's Boeing
versus Airbus or, you know, Hermes and LVMH versus carrying in Burberry or, you know,
we can go down, Dordash versus everyone else in that space basically, right, over versus
Lyft and we, you know, there's, there's so many examples of winners and losers getting
way more pronounced and a lot of that's strategic decision, a lot of that's leadership honestly
and execution and I think those things are all really, really tied together.
Maybe just like, like bullet lists like enumerate the things you seeing the winners of those
pairwise examples you just gave doing versus the losers because in some of those categories
like some airline, you know, some aircraft manufacturers or something, it's not like
they, you know, they're pivoting to some random, like, they're still making airplanes or over
still driving people around, Lyft is too. So, so what is, what are, yeah, list those
things like what are the winners doing in a, in a real cost of capital environment that
the losers aren't.
So I think it's, it's a bunch of things. Number one, there's really clear strategy in terms
of what are we focused on, right? I think so many companies have eight different initiatives
that are simultaneous and there's a lack of understanding when you talk to people inside
of a company of what actually matters, what are we driving towards, right? That's one,
two, there's a culture of accountability and measurement, right? Some companies have it.
It seems so obvious, right? Like people are bonessed off of a certain thing. They, they
do, you know, forward looking plans and budgets every year and they hit them where they don't.
But there's some companies that are religious about, you know, having those be thoughtful
exercises and accountable exercises and ones that are not, right? And I think that shows
through a lot. Three is companies who treat their consumers well, whether that's a B
to B enterprise, a B to C enterprise, is you, you, you, when you talk to customers and
we do this all the time, right? And as part of our research, you hear how they are treated
and it is different. They are, there's someone for them to pick up the phone and call. Their
needs are being met. They don't feel like they're being aggressively raised, like their price
is not being used as a weapon against them. They're not, they're being serviced. It's
just different. There's again, back to accountability and sort of a level of operating standard
that is the expectation of how things are done. I think the other thing is, there's
a long-term orientation that I think some companies lose their way around, particularly
when you have a lot of turnover and the amount of back to people and you have a lot of turnover
incentives get set, whether that's tied to a stock price or the metrics that drive compensation
and people's incentives are not aligned, right? And then, and that doesn't promote long-term
strategic thinking or orientation that filters down to the culture. So now people are cutting
corners. They're trying to make numbers, make budget. That's a very different way to
live as a company than it is around. We may miss a quarter, but this is the right investment
to make, right? And so companies that I think do a good job of balancing short and long-term
one and two are able to communicate to the market, you know, a consistent level of execution,
right? We joke a lot internally that, and I say this lots of management teams, every
time you open your mouth to report your quarter, your stocks up are down 20%. What that tells
me is you are not doing a good job communicating your business. You don't have good visibility
around your business because you are surprising the market every time you speak. Good and bad.
That's not like multiple enhancing for your company over time, right? And so that comes
from the internals of how a business has run. What are the incentives? What are the metrics?
What's the culture? What's the retention? All of these things I think are such important
glue that distinguish the better executors from the poor executors.
Do you think the best that do it understand the concept of cost of capital really well
and drive it? And if they do, what are the best do to drive down the cost of their capital?
I think of it from the perspective of trade-offs in a budget meeting, right? And so in the era
of zero interest rates and the public markets for years rewarding growth at any cost, I
think the disciplines inside of a lot of companies really went away and everyone was
just motivated to find new ways to grow regardless of the cost. And what is clear in today's
era and you have seen this from a lot of the big platform companies, particularly in the
internet space, there is just a new religion around cost where when you sit in a budget
meeting or even an engineering meeting and you are putting forth two or three initiatives
that you want to get funded, you are being asked how to fund them from your budget, right?
Which is just a very different orientation of this is not an open pie that is limitless
in terms of dollars that can flow to you. And if you want to do something, you have to
like, you know, it's like a Sophie's Choice, right? It's like one of the things that you've
already been approved for. It needs to be sacrificed because then you're going to feel the pain
and it's going to really pressure the decision-making around solving for the best thing or the best
two things, right? Or if you want more resources on a project, like convince me why, right,
that cultural orientation to me is sort of the business translation of driving down the
cost of capital. And people understanding that there are costs associated with every resource
inside of a company and how to think about those in a way that is personal, right? I always say
that when we look at our budgets every year for our third-party data sources and all the things
that our analysts want to use, there's a lot of nice to-haves, but what are like the must-haves?
And I always say to our management team, what if we made them pay for them themselves? What would
they actually keep? And what would they say, you know what, this is a nice to have, I don't need
to have, right? And we would actually force different thinking around, let me look back,
what's actually informed the decisions that I've made and has helped me make better decisions
versus like an input that was one of 10 that didn't actually change anything from me, right?
What has been the worst period of returns that you've experienced at Lone Pine and what, like,
tell me about that era and what you learned from it? Sure. I mean, we'll put aside the financial
crisis because I think that was just like a- So universal. Yeah, a universal thing. For sure,
it was the end of '21 in the first few months of '22. And we learned a lot, you know- Tell me
everything. So, you know, referencing what I just said about a period in time where the market was
consistently rewarding the best-positioned companies who had great unity economics but were
investing meaningfully ahead of their growth rates and the market was forgiving and encouraging
actually of that level of investment such that many of these companies were funding extraneous
things, burning cash. That didn't matter as long as, you know, the growth rates were continuing
to accelerate and people were comfortable that the underlying unit economics were sound, right?
So, what happened, I think, was a lack of accountability around valuation and no near-term
valuation support because everyone was looking at multi-year out normalized, you know, margin
structures to then discount back and say this is a fair price to pay for an equity.
Instead of looking at if something changes and something goes bump in the night, you know,
on a next 12 or next 24 months earnings are cash full basis, is our valuation support.
And the regime changed, I think, very quickly when people started to realize ourselves included,
that the Fed was behind. And we started having this conversation in the fall of '21,
really in the spring of '21, owning a lot of these businesses that were the leaders. And by the way,
with the benefit of hindsight from a 2025 perspective are the winners, right? A lot of the companies we
owned, they were the right ones to own, we just paid too much for them, right? And when the regime
changed and it was clear that we were going to need to be getting into a hiking cycle
quickly and aggressively, we pivoted but not quickly enough, right? And so we took some of that
high growth exposure down that had been some of the most profitable exposure for us on the prior
24 months, but not enough and not fast enough. And so when we came into 2022, you know, as you
remember, like it was just kind of the market was down. And it was super quick. And it was like a
reprice mechanism that happened very, very quickly. And we weren't quick enough to react. And to the
point earlier around believing we owned different bets and payments or e-commerce or software,
when the regime changed, none of that mattered. And that nuance was lost and they all traded like
one stock, right? And so we had too much exposure, we had lost balance in the portfolio. And you know,
part of that, I forgive to some extent because the market had been rewarding that for many years
prior, but we didn't act quickly enough and respond quickly enough to a conversation we were
having as well as the market was having at the same time around sort of a different regime from
a macro perspective, an interest rate perspective. And so that was the huge mistake. We spent, you
know, a lot of time internalizing the lessons, studying all the mistakes, you know, points in
time when we had this conversation and didn't make change earlier, a year earlier, 18 months
earlier, and that was the right decision. And then the conversation we were having at the time and
this decision to move some capital, but not enough and not quickly enough. And really memorialized,
I think a lot of that thinking and learning around reinforcing that there are lots of ways to make
money in the market and we just got really narrow in our purview, I think, and lost the perspective
on balance. And so I think the changes we made in the first quarter of 22 and sort of resetting
the book to a much more balanced book that has lots of different flavors of things in it.
Again, not top down prescriptively, but I think really prioritizing that in a different way.
And going back to honestly, a lot of sectors where we had a lot of domain expertise, where we'd
had a lot of success historically that we kind of got away from because, you know, the sex of the
high growth internet oriented kind of tech stuff had been so intoxicating, I think, for not only
ourselves, but a lot of investors who are attracted to growth businesses that are creating value.
We didn't own NVIDIA. We didn't, you know, it wasn't three stocks that drove the whole portfolio and
they're across a number of different industries. And so the breadth that is driving our performance
is very lone pine-esque to me and something that we got away from, and that's the mistake, I think.
A couple decades into studying companies. Can you describe the perfect business?
I mean, it's all the things we're all searching the globe for, right? We want
incredible leadership, really strong in economics, a really good moat around a business in terms of
something that is different, incredible value proposition to the customer, whoever it may be,
the ability to grow organically without investing meaningful capital and a huge runway for growth
that can last for many, many years without being disrupted if we're doing our jobs, right? And in
terms of the management team of the company that's running it. And maybe like an adjacent question is
the perfect investment because I suspect that when one of those exists, the whole kind of knows it,
and it's priced. So I think it's changing leadership. It's a new product that the market doesn't
appreciate fully in terms of its capability, how big it can be, how creative it is to margins and
returns, how little capital it requires, ways to leverage the core IP of a business in new
channels, in new products, the value of distribution to the earlier conversation and
how that's underappreciated in certain businesses and the ability to flow other products, other
services into that, or sometimes it's just the benefits of scale. The companies get to a certain
size and then their market power step functions, right? And then that somehow improves the value
proposition and the flywheel of what they're doing in a way that the market doesn't fully
appreciate. And we see this now, I would say like in the alts space, for example, where these
businesses are now, you know, they're all mostly public and that's new, correct? Yeah, KKR
or Aries and their ability to offer unparalleled customer service, product innovation, opportunities
for talent development, new channels of growth is just it's spinning on its own in terms of this
flywheel, right? In a way that I don't think anybody could have really anticipated and what's
interesting about these is, you know, the bear case on them because they're a new asset class
as public companies is we haven't really been through like a big cycle. So how will they perform?
And then the other piece I think the market struggles with is how do you value the carried
interest part of their revenue model, right? Everyone can value management fees and make a
projection around how a UN will grow. But what do you pay for that, right? And so that's interesting
to me because that we can do work on that, we can have a point of view on that,
we can look across cycles, look across products, how they're growing and think about how funds
perform and have a thoughtful analytical answer to that question. But the market, there isn't
in answer to that question yet. And these are still under owned relative to like all of the big,
you know, institutions that have to index that have to own these things and will continue to
have to own them in bigger size as they grow. And so the idea of like a new asset class is
sort of interesting to me even though it's, you know, we blacksmiths in public for a while,
but all these companies are newly public in the last decade. And I think the role of
still figuring out how to analyze and value them as public companies.
I love the idea of the investment opportunities coming around change. I was with John Zito from
Apollo who just made co-president of Apollo last night. And it's so interesting because,
I don't know, probably the stock price of Apollo doesn't really reflect all the things that John
might do in the future. Amazing guy. And so it's getting into that like changing thing
where the opportunities come from for a little fine, it sounds like. I'd love to do apply that
idea to a couple different like sectors. So you mentioned kind of a broader purview getting back
to some of the things that, you know, made the firm originally, obviously Steve was a consumer
analyst and retail analyst. And so, so, so cool to talk to him about that space. What would be like
the top three, would you say, outside of like big TMT, which we can talk about too.
But outside of those big companies, what are like the top three sectors that you find yourself
spending your time in now? We own a lot of one-off ideas in non-bank
financials. So the alt is one example of that. But we have a number of positions of single stock,
not thematic companies that are doing really interesting things. One is around
transformative M&A at scale. One is around product innovation. One is around AI. That's not an
AI business, but is using AI to just thoughtfully do things inside of a sector. So that's an area
where I feel like we typically don't do a lot with the banks. Not an area where we feel like we
can really add value. There's regulatory risk and all the, and we don't think, you know, those are
not sort of, don't really measure against our quality filter as businesses. But there's a number
of pockets inside of financials that we think are not very well covered that are pretty interesting.
And we've got a great team doing research there. So I think that's one area.
We have been investors for really two decades almost and continue to be in the aerospace market,
both OEM and aftermarket, and continue to love those businesses. They have, you know, all of the
attributes of businesses. We like great organic growth, great pricing power. You know, a lot of,
as people fly more, planes get used more. There's a need for replacement parts that get specked
in to planes as they're being built. And so they're typically single source or sole source,
and they were super low cost as a percentage of the overall plane. And so they're just recurring
revenue businesses with a lot of pricing power and very little capital against those businesses
to grow organically and, you know, feel like there's a pretty good open-ended structural story around
people traveling more and rallying the experiences. And so that will continue to, I think, be a very
productive area for us. And there's a bunch of different names that we've owned in that ecosystem
and will continue to own likely over time. So I think that's another big area. Those are two.
I mean, consumer is harder, I would say. Most businesses, we're more active there on the short
side than the long side at this point, just because there's just an inherent maturity to, I think,
a lot of those businesses. And the ones that are the really scaled winners, even just watching the
reevaluation of Walmart in the last 18 months has been super interesting, as they've really
emerged as a more consistent executor and Doug's done a fantastic job, I think, with that business.
But that, I mean, Walmart's now trading at a pretty hefty multiple and cost-coast trading,
really, I mean, these are the best, you know, executors in the space, and they're really
expensive. So I don't, I think the market has sort of figured out that they are the winners.
And so less to do there, in my mind, in terms of runway for long growth, that's under-appreciated
or maybe fairly valued relative to the actual level of growth. That's one of the things we
debate a lot, honestly, is in areas like health care, it's happens in certain sectors, and also
in certain geographies where there's very few companies that have high growth or have exposure
to a thematic that the market is excited about because of a geography or because of a sector
focus. And we like those businesses too, but they tend to trade at valuations with don't stack up
against businesses that we see across the portfolio that are more compelling. So even
though we love lots of companies around the world and would love to own them, we're always waiting
for like a wobble or a dislocation or a perceived competitive threat to give us our chance to own
them because they don't stack relative to owning more of a lot of the compounding businesses that
we love. If you think about the whole industry, what do you think is the biggest problem
facing the investing world? I mean, certainly the funds flows of the last bunch of years
would tell you that active management is undervalued relative to our understanding and execution of
that value. The move to passive, this idea that like just on the MAG7 and I can do that myself,
and what do I need you, has become a little bit of a cocktail party chatter at this point.
And we are obviously huge believers in active management and huge believers in the value of
doing fundamental analytical work on companies and not indexing. And that the premium for that is
undervalued relative to its worth. And I think part of what makes that, I think a difficult
conversation right now is the short term orientation of the market and how it takes. We're focused on
compounding over a very long period of time. We are the largest single investor in our fund,
a third of the assets is internal capital. So what I wake up every day really excited to do is
compound my money alongside of our LPs. I think that's a pretty compelling proposition to a
potential client for our firm. And that doesn't happen in a day or a week or a month. And my
investment underwriting doesn't tie to that time horizon. And so we want to be judged over years,
not quarters, and we're increasingly in a market that is evaluated by forget quarters,
weeks and months per the pods conversation earlier. And a lot of pods, if you don't put up,
we laugh at the activity in the market in the last few days of every month.
Because if you're not having a bad month, you're going to get your capital yank, so you take risk,
right? Or you have to de-gross. This never existed five or 10 years ago,
but this is the market forces at work. And so again, great for us long-term investors.
I want to lean in when they're leaning out and vice versa. But the value of doing that and the
benefit of that capability takes time to reveal itself and isn't going to show itself in a quarter
or a year. And I think that's what the market's missing.
Say one more click about how the pods work from your perspective and the weird incentives in
there and what doesn't work? 100%. I mean, you have inside of these shops 20, 30, 40 desks or pads,
as they call them covering a sector, right? And they all look at the same data and they sit in
the same meetings and on the same calls. And of course they talk to each other because you have
appeared networks sitting inside your own firm. And so often, and I have never worked at a pub,
I have several friends who still do and have come out of there, you can see how everyone's
lined up. And you'll have 20, 25 books, long a stock into a print of a quarterly earnings estimate
and a quarterly conference call. And the numbers come out. And it was better, but it wasn't better
enough because the whisper number or the data was suggesting they were going to beat by three
points and then they'll only beat by two points. And so the stock's actually going to sell off.
Right? The game of you hand me an earnings release, and I'll tell you what the stock's going to do
was actually a fundamental game that we were pretty good at a decade ago. Now it's like,
coin toss, what's the setup? You tell me what's the whisper number? How are the pods lined up? Are
they longest? Are they short it? Because that's going to dictate the trading action the day of.
And the opening market reaction versus what happens over the course of the day is everyone's covering
the short because it was bad, but it was a horse, right? And that's like, this is what happens all
the time, right? And so that requires different muscles from us in terms of how we position
ourselves and respond to that. But I think that's what is happening. And these people are on,
they have draw down limits of where they can draw down on a monthly or quarterly basis.
Their capital gets pulled. And that's the lives they lead. And so what you see in market action
in terms of reactions to events is a function of those incentives and those structures.
This has been so incredibly fun. It's so neat to hear how the whole machine works.
And just about your career and the competitive nature and the tennis, it's just an amazing,
amazing story. I always ask the same traditional closing question. What is the kindest thing that
anyone's ever done for you? So the summer after my freshman year of college, I taught tennis at a
camp in Florida and there was a golf camp at the same resort. And I became friendly with the golf
pro and we'd meet after I was done teaching for the day and he taught me how to play golf on
summer, which I don't play anymore. But I did at the time. And at the end of the summer,
the last night we had dinner together before I went back to school and he said to me,
can I tell you something? He was probably, I was 18 and he was 32. And he said, you know,
you're so driven and you're so intense. And I just can tell that I'm super excited to follow
your life because it's going to be really interesting is my sense. He said, but you're also an incredibly
soulful person and your relationships clearly matter to you. He said, so my piece of advice
for you would be figure out who in your life matters to you, figure out what matters to them
and then show up for them in all the ways that matter to them. And that will be a rewarding
life for you. Because he's like, I think he got the professional part down, which was super sweet.
And so I take that to heart and work really hard on relationships and the people that show up for me
to be there for them, for the things and for the people that matter for them.
One follow up was a beautiful closing thought. How have you gotten better at that? Like, if
everyone listening, here's that simple method, like, I want to do that. Right. What are the tactics
of getting better at that that you've learned? Making sure it's mutual. I think relationships
change people's lives change. I think you recognize I'm, I just turned 50 that some friendships and
relationships that have duration in your life are more a function of circumstance and you wouldn't
necessarily choose some of those relationships today. And the ones that are the inverse of that,
that are are have the duration and are still the most meaningful are the most valuable. And so it's
the concentration theory of both investing in your highest and best ideas and the concentration
theory of just the people who are incredibly meaningful to you because they've seen you grow
up and seen you grow and change. But then also the last piece where the postscript would be
leaving room for new because new, I think, helps us all grow and and we're different than we were
when I certainly am and then I was 20. And the new is the reflection of, like, who you meet and
connect with today, which wouldn't be the same thing as it was 30 years ago. So beautiful closing
thought. Kelly, thanks so much for your time. Thank you. Enjoyed it.
