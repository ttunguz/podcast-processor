### 2. KEY INSIGHTS
1. **Comfy's Focus on Diffusion Models**
   - Clear Statement: Comfy is primarily focused on diffusion models.
   - Extended Supporting Quote: "Yeah, it's something I've wanted to eventually add to core, but it's more like, not a very high priority. But because a lot of people use text for like prompt enhancement, like other things like that."
   - Significance: This indicates the current priorities and potential future directions of Comfy's project.

2. **Potential for Text-Based Models**
   - Clear Statement: There is interest in incorporating text models into Comfy's work.
   - Extended Supporting Quote: "So it's, yeah, it's just that my focus has always been like on diffusion models, yeah, unless some text diffusion model comes out."
   - Significance: This shows an openness to exploring text-based technologies if they align with the project's goals.

3. **Open vs. Closed Source Models**
   - Clear Statement: The preference for open-source models is highlighted.
   - Extended Supporting Quote: "Yeah, if a good one comes out, then well, he'll probably have planted since it's fits with the whole."
   - Significance: This emphasizes the importance of open-source technologies in Comfy's project.

4. **Collaboration and Community**
   - Clear Statement: The use of Comfy by others could enhance the ecosystem.
   - Extended Supporting Quote: "So, yeah. And then would you ever do text? Yeah. Well, you can already do text with some custom notes."
   - Significance: This points to a collaborative or community-driven aspect of Comfy's work.

5. **Competitive Landscape Awareness**
   - Clear Statement: There is awareness of other projects like Mid-Journey.
   - Extended Supporting Quote: "I mean, I imagine it's going to be a close source to mid-journey."
   - Significance: This indicates that Comfy is aware of the competitive landscape and considers how their project fits into it.
