2. KEY INSIGHTS

- OpenAI is launching a new "Responses API" that unifies capabilities from previous APIs like Chat Completions and the Assistants API, while adding support for new built-in tools.

"We're launching this new API called the responses API. It works with tools. We think it'll be like a great option for all the future agentic products that we build." - Romain

- Three new built-in tools are being released: web search, improved file search, and computer vision tools for automating user interfaces.

"We're launching a web search tool. This is basically a jadivity for search, but available in the API. We're launching an improved file search tool...And then we're also launching our computer use tools." - Romain  

- The web search tool utilizes a fine-tuned GPT model optimized for search quality, citation accuracy, and real-time querying of internet data.

"Their main goal is to like get information...from all of our data sources that we use to gather information for search, and then pick the right things and then cite them as accurately as possible." - Romain

- The Agents SDK (previously called Swarm) is being relaunched with new capabilities like tracing, type support, and guard railing to assist developers in building multi-agent AI systems.

"We're calling it the agents SDK. It's gonna have built-in tracing in the OpenAI dashboard." - Romain

3. TECHNOLOGY & PRODUCT DEVELOPMENTS  

- Key technical innovations:
   - Responses API: A unified API supporting new agentic workflows and built-in tools
   - Web search tool: Fine-tuned GPT model for high-quality web search and citations
   - Computer vision tool: Model optimized for automating user interfaces and browsers
   - Agents SDK: Framework for orchestrating multi-agent AI systems with tracing

- Core differentiation: 
   - Combining large AI models with integrated access to latest web data, private docs, and automation capabilities
   - Visual observability into agent workflows via tracing in the OpenAI dashboard

- Future plans:
   - Merge research preview models into main model lines once stable
   - Integrate Agents SDK traces with OpenAI's Reinforcement Learning products

4. COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

- Companies mentioned:
   - Hebbia: "they were able to build with the file search, like, you know, take all of the FAQ and travel policies, for instance, that you have you, you put that in file search tool and then you don't have to think about anything."

OpenAI positions its offering as an integrated solution combining large language models, real-time data access, file management capabilities, and multi-agent orchestration tools.

5. TEAM & CULTURE SIGNALS

- Leadership philosophy: Learn quickly from developer feedback to continuously improve offerings.

"we can't wait to see what developers will build with these tools and how we can like learn as quickly as we can from them to make them even better over time." - Romain

6. KEY METRICS & BUSINESS DETAILS  

- No specific metrics were shared, but some insights on pricing/monetization:
   - Responses API storage of state/logs is free for 30 days
   - Web search tool costs $30 per 1000 queries (implying need to manage costs)

7. NOTABLE TECHNOLOGIES

- No specific technologies mentioned outside of OpenAI's own AI models and APIs.

8. COMPANIES MENTIONED

Hebbia: "they were able to build with the file search, like, you know, take all of the FAQ and travel policies, for instance, that you have you, you put that in file search tool and then you don't have to think about anything."

9. PEOPLE MENTIONED  

Corey Quinn: "All I'll say is that my friend, Corey Quinn, says that anything that can be used as a database will be used as a database, so be prepared for some abuse."
