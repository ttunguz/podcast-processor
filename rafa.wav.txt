 So, just talk to Brandi's University, I don't know if that's how you say it, went pretty
 well.
 That was really fun actually, I haven't been interviewed like that for a while.
 And yeah, I think I kind of crushed the answers, the questions or whatever, we'll see what
 they say.
 I did funny at the end I did ask, and they asked all the questions I think you would expect
 them to ask of me.
 And I did ask at the end I said, "Hey, maybe it's just seven sales, I don't have to get
 this question.
 But I'm just curious, do you have any concerns about investing in the fund, the next fund?
 And then they started laughing and said, "Yeah, when you have got to ask that question,
 I think," he said, "Nothing other than just the regular things of a firm your size.
 I mean, the team's new, it's a small fund, still time to prove the people that are brand
 and I'm betting, I like Tom√°s being this really smart, likable guy, he's hired a lot
 of like-minded, similar, smart, likable people.
 But there's volatility sometimes in new teams and it's to be determined on like if the differentiators
 you guys are focusing on are really going to make a difference and that the best of the
 best startups are going to want to flock toward you guys, or is it the big names or whoever
 that might be.
 So anyway, I just want to share with you what they brought up in terms of answering that
 question.
 But I think they liked it, so hopefully that was helpful.
 Yeah, if you have any other questions about how that went, just let me know, but I enjoyed
 it and hope that went well.
