2. KEY INSIGHTS

Insight 1: AI engineering is different from traditional ML engineering. "Nowadays like anyone like anyone who wants to like leverage AI to build applications can like just leverage one of those amazing available models to do so and it just makes it so much more accessible."

Why this is significant: It means a wider range of people can now leverage AI to build applications, not just those with expertise in building ML models from scratch.

Insight 2: As AI becomes more intelligent, it becomes harder to evaluate. "As a more intelligent AI becomes like the harder it is to evaluate it. A lot of the failures are silent."

Why this is significant: Highly capable AI systems can make mistakes that are hard to detect, making thorough evaluation critical but challenging.

Insight 3: Prompt engineering seems easy but is underrated in its importance and difficulty. "People don't take prompt engineering seriously because they think this is like not much engineering to it. Anyone can do it but not many people can do so effectively."

Why this is significant: Writing effective prompts to elicit desired behaviors from AI models is a key skill, and more difficult than it may seem.  

Insight 4: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is likely here to stay even with longer context models. "We're only gonna having more and more information so it's like I think we always experience our usage to fit in whatever context length that's going to be available."

Why this is significant: RAG allows AI systems to draw from external knowledge beyond just what fits in the model's context window. This will remain important as information grows.

Insight 5: Planning - determining sequences of actions to accomplish goals - is very challenging for AI systems. "Planning um is also not a new problem maybe what is new is that using LM to do planning but planning itself is not new."

Why this is significant: Effective planning is a key capability for AI agents interacting with real-world environments and tools. Making language models better at planning is an important challenge.

3. TECHNOLOGY & PRODUCT DEVELOPMENTS

Key technical/product innovations discussed:

- OpenAI: Extended quote providing context about the company or its relation to the story
"For example you can see like uh maybe nice and raise a prompt for AI just maybe the the job could be like a F1 score or like a relevant score"
- Anthropic: Extended quote providing context about the company or its relation to the story 
"Of course I have two minus thinking but also confounding factors like campaign but maybe it's not going up very simplistically uh all like for free protections uh it's very common nowadays because you can tell very clearly that like uh oh uh like how many short fraudulent transactions of like you were born to like flag and I stopped um and like for jet of AI like one of the most common jet of AI use cases today is coding okay so there are many reasons why coding is popular and I said like one of the reasons is that it's very it's a lot easier to evaluate coding than I gather because like here's general code right you can evaluate like does it compare right and like this is general's uh expanded output"
- Google: Extended quote providing context about the company or its relation to the story
"Now we are paying too much money for like open AI and anthropic Google so now we need to build our own model like and so so now we invest into the model"

- Not directly quoted
- Mentioned as someone who believes autoregressive language models cannot plan
- Richard Sutton [Author of AI textbook]: Extended quote providing context about this person
"I just take out some like AI textbook from the 80s and 90s and see how we modify agents and actually makes things a lot easier so actually based my definition in my books based on um Pitanovic and um on Rasos books uh from from the 90s it's like it's a really good book"
- Co-author of an AI textbook Chip Huyen references for agent definitions

"I just take out some like AI textbook from the 80s and 90s and see how we modify agents and actually makes things a lot easier so actually based my definition in my books based on um Pitanovic and um on Rasos books uh from from the 90s it's like it's a really good book"  
- Co-author of an AI textbook Chip Huyen references for agent definitions
- Claude Shannon [Mathematician]: Extended quote providing context about this person
"So letting uh went cost Shannon to introduce a concept of like entropy he did some pretty fun exercise like he was like he asked a question like hmm what is the entropy of the pre of the english language so like that could be like the the the lower bound like but like because he did it like in 1950s he did that based on like a very very short sequence of like maybe 10 character like 10 10 words um and the interesting thing about entropy is that like the more preceding um the longer the pre preceding sequence like the longer the context the easier they should predict the next token right"
- Not directly quoted
- Work on entropy of English language sequences referenced
