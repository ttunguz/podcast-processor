- Guests and their roles/backgrounds:
Jamie Davidson, Co-founder at Omni. Handles customer facing initiatives. Previously worked at Looker for 5-6 years pre and post acquisition. 
- Featured company overview:
Omni - an analytics company that aims to bridge the gap between semantic models and lightweight ad hoc analysis. Still an early stage company.

KEY INSIGHTS
1. Many Looker customers used other tools like BigQuery, Mode, and Tableau alongside Looker to evolve data models and do lightweight analysis. This created data silos.
"Firm believer in the value of a semantic model, defining things in a single place, gives democratized access and change management on top of it. But saw, effectively, 100% of Looker customers using other tools alongside it, to be able to go touch and feel the data to evolve the data model."
This is significant because it highlights a key gap in Looker's offering that Omni aims to solve.

2. Omni aims to make it much easier to build and evolve semantic models while enabling lightweight ad hoc analysis in a single platform.
"How do we believe in sort of a semantic model, but make it way, way easier to build it, make it much easier to do lightweight ad hoc analysis, kind of regardless of where the user is on a technical sophistication."
Solving this problem is Omni's core focus and differentiator. 

3. Data teams have become more focused on driving business ROI rather than building perfect models using many disparate tools.  
"Data teams were super robust. They had lots of people, they had lots of tooling...And now it's more like, hey, how do we make sure we're solving the business problems that the organization has to and do it in a way where we create a ton of leverage."
This shift in priorities makes Omni's consolidated platform approach more appealing.

4. Ease of use and removing friction is becoming increasingly important for analytics tools and AI/ML is poised to play a big role. 
"If it's lower friction to access it, like, it should be in slack. It should be on your, like, whatever on your phone on your, you know, on any device that you basically can engage with, you should be able to, you know, the sales person who's like walking into a store he's trying to sell to can ask, you know, wait, tell me all the context about all the similar customers like this person and what's the best way for me to sell to them."
Reducing barriers to data access and insight discovery is a key industry trend that AI/ML can enable.

5. Open table formats like Iceberg have potential to enable cheaper storage for less frequently accessed historical data, but risk introducing Hadoop-like complexity.
"There's clear demand for kind of lower cost alternatives for like less, like lower value data warehouse workloads or analytical workloads that should be cheaper... But I do get a little bit of, hey, you know, this is like a new HDFS Hadoop kind of, and you have to hire a small, small army of engineers to go and manage this." 
Managing this tradeoff between cost and complexity will be important as open table formats mature.

TEAM & CULTURE SIGNALS
- Omni is emulating parts of Looker's strong customer-centric culture 
"Very much inspired by a looker from like, you know, from a like kind of customer orientation and extreme customer focus perspective too. And a lot of the sort of core problems that we want to solve are, I think we, you know, we sort of, we think of ourselves as kind of like a logical successor to, to some of the looker, looker, you know, philosophy at least."

KEY METRICS & BUSINESS DETAILS
- Go-to-market insights:
"The consolidation story, I think is actually something where like people are finding some residents and like, hey, like can't, you know, can we replace the, you know, the like two or three tools that we're using for analytics that are all kind of overlapping and bring them into a single platform."
Omni is finding traction by positioning as a consolidated platform to replace multiple overlapping analytics tools.

NOTABLE TECHNOLOGIES  
- Omni is leveraging DuckDB, wrapping it in Wasm and running it in-browser for a reusable cache
"We used DuckDB, basically we wrap it in Wasm, run it in the browser for basically, we call it a refriable cache. So like, you know, we connect the data warehouse will query directly, but then we'll also sort of reuse data sets to make it faster, cheaper for the end customer. So I have been blown away by DuckDB."
