The conversation is about the concept of "AI Native Development" and its potential to revolutionize the way we build software applications. The guest, Guy Pujon, is the founder of Tessell, a company that aims to enable AI native development for developers.

Here are some key points from the conversation:

1. **Definition of AI Native Development**: Guy defines AI native development as the ability to develop software applications using AI and machine learning (ML) as primary components, rather than just adding AI/ML features to existing applications.
2. **Current State of AI Adoption**: Guy believes that while AI has made significant progress in recent years, its adoption is still limited to specific domains and industries. He argues that AI native development can help democratize access to AI and make it more widely applicable.
3. **Challenges in AI Development**: Guy highlights several challenges in developing AI applications, including data quality issues, lack of explainability, and the need for specialized expertise.
4. **Tessell's Solution**: Tessell is building a platform that enables developers to build AI native applications using a visual interface, without requiring extensive AI/ML expertise. The platform provides pre-built components, automated testing, and deployment tools to simplify the development process.
5. **Benefits of AI Native Development**: Guy believes that AI native development can lead to significant benefits, including improved application performance, reduced development time, and increased innovation.
6. **Future of Software Development**: Guy predicts that AI native development will become the norm in the future, with AI and ML becoming integral components of software applications.

The conversation also touches on other topics, such as:

* The importance of developer experience and ease of use in adopting new technologies
* The need for education and training to prepare developers for AI native development
* The potential risks and challenges associated with relying on AI and ML in critical applications

Overall, the conversation provides insights into the concept of AI native development, its benefits and challenges, and the potential impact on the software development industry.
