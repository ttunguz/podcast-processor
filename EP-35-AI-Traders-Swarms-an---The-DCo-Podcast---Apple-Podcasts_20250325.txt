Here are the relevant sections from the podcast transcript:

1. EPISODE CONTEXT  

- Podcast name: Deco podcast - bringing stories from founders and investors in Web3
- Hosts: No host names/backgrounds provided
- Guest: Suhail "Shah" Doshi - Co-founder & CEO of Anthropic AI (previously ElizaOS)
- Featured company: Anthropic AI (fka ElizaOS) - AI research company building AI agents and models, was previously focused on autonomous investing agents 

2. KEY INSIGHTS

- The AI market is very uncertain and sentiment is low, but AI will be incredibly valuable and integrated into everything. Quality products that show real utility will be key.

"I think that for AI, it's the same thing. We just have to give like the best possible product. So, you know, that's kind of the wartime arc, essentially."

- Hiring and retaining talent has been challenging due to potential for higher individual payouts by launching their own tokens, requiring intense focus on shipped products. 

"I think the other problem with going out and being very like, okay, maybe public, I'm going to be tweeting, or it'd be like going to the putting these events together, like speaking, is that then I'm like kind of disconnected from my own team."

- Partnerships and marketing have provided temporary hype/value but ultimately been distracting from the core task of building products.

"I think that if I was, like, you know, that moment where you kind of blow up, it's probably the moment where you actually want to just build harder and, like, not do the victory lap at all and just, like, focus on shipping the next version."

3. TECHNOLOGY & PRODUCT DEVELOPMENTS  

- Working on "V2" version of their product - a framework for deploying/managing swarms of AI agents to assist with tasks 
- Initial agents to ship: compliance officer, social media assistant, community manager, therapy bot, project manager
- Exploring credential management, multi-tenancy, task routing across agents 
- Goal of making the "social graph" itself the marketplace for discovering/using agents

4. COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE

- Don't see themselves as directly competing with blockchains/protocols, but rather providing agent/AI capabilities to assist communities, DAOs, etc.
- Arc is seen as a competitor for token launch pad offerings
- Overall market has many projects over-promising and under-delivering on AI capabilities so far

5. TEAM & CULTURE SIGNALS

- Intense focus on coding, not getting distracted by conferences/events 
- Challenge of hiring devs to "replace himself" while maintaining a clear technical vision
- Struggling with keeping talent incentivized when they see potential upside from launching their own tokens

6. KEY METRICS & BUSINESS DETAILS  

- Have explored models like allocating 20-25% token supply to the team to retain incentives
- Generating some revenue from "Eliza Studios" consulting on AI implementations for clients
- Planning token buybacks, infrastructure fees, rev shares as sources of token buy pressure
- Seeking sustainability first before additional economic levers

7. NOTABLE TECHNOLOGIES  

- Large language models and prompting for code generation 
- Multi-agent systems, agent coordination 
- Technologies for managing credentials, multi-tenancy isolation for AI agents

8. COMPANIES MENTIONED

- Anthropic: "I think that within that, like, obviously, AI is very valuable. AI is going to be in everything."
- OpenAI: "Like chat GPT is a great user experience. They're just like, this is the best model in the world."
- BlackRock: "I think that the best team is probably like BlackRock or something, you know, like it's a hedge fund experts"  
- Arc: "arc doing their launch because we learned a lot of lessons from that"

9. PEOPLE MENTIONED  

- Vitalik Buterin (Co-founder, Ethereum): "But I think that like, it's not just the problem of how do you reward individual like projects or ecosystem or even contributors to projects."
- Ellis Dan: "This was actually a friend Ellis Dan's idea and we were kind of making this in the course of the hackathon and sort of ran with it."
- Solene (AI Developer): "Solange is an AI agent that makes code contributions and analyzes GitHub repos."
- Dani Baravalle ("Dollos"): "I think of like dollos, like the bully and our friend, them and doing Dolly in. And they're cool people, but they're in a pretty shitty situation."

Welcome to the Deco podcast where we bring you stories from founders and investors in Web3.
Before we get started, this is not a financial or legal advice. It's just a conversation about
things we find interesting in Web3. We use expressed at our own personal opinions. Deco members or
guests appearing on the show may have positions on assets they talk about. All right, for the
first time, summer is making a second appearance, none other than saw from earlier AI 16z, AI 16z
now, and AI is always now. Welcome to the show, sir. Thanks for having me back. Hope everything's
all right. Team is in good spirits, despite what is happening in the markets. Yeah, I mean,
it could have been worse for us. Obviously, everybody's getting killed right now, even I
think Solana itself. But honestly, for myself, there was like a lot of attention on us very quickly,
and I really just wanted to focus on building for a bit. So I don't mind that kind of goes up
them down. Everyone's in Denver, but I'm actually just came back home for the first time in a while,
just sitting head down, building, streaming. So, you know, in my comfort zone, basically.
All right. So now that we are there, what are your thoughts on where the market is, that is one,
and one follow question is, oh, has the AI performed? Yeah, I mark and decent spot on the AI.
Okay. Well, those are different questions. Let's talk about, I mean, the market is like, as
though things couldn't get worse, then you have like SPF tweeting. And then, you know, we're
expecting a Yeezys meme coin next week. I'm sure that'll go well. I'm sure that won't be like a
max extractive event. Oh, yeah, no, not right. Nothing has been max extractive. I think it
could definitely get worse from here. It should probably brace for that reality. But generally,
I think the sentiment on CT is probably not been worse since I've been around, at least. It's pretty
bad. And generally, I think the market is very uncertain for like a lot of macro economic factors.
I think that within that, like, obviously, AI is very valuable. AI is going to be in everything.
No one even really has like license to say they are the AI company, like every company is an AI
company on some level now, everybody's integrating this stuff. You know, I think the market is looking
for like, well, how do I get exposure? Like, I can't just buy in anthropic or open AI stocks.
So like, how do I get exposure to this? And that's where like agents and
AI consumer stuff really makes a lot of sense. But I think that like after the initial high cycle,
it really comes down to like, okay, cool. That's hype. That people like the vision of that. But like,
are they actually using it in their lives and workflows? And I think now we're in that period
of like, it's pretty make or break. And the stuff that was just flashed in the pan or hype or like,
oh, yeah, cool. We did the thing. A lot of that's probably going to not make it. And some of the
stuff I think that we're like, wow, that's really getting adoption. People really like
that they're using it will probably survive and do quite well. And I could see a lot of catalysts,
like, you know, an example of like a really useful swarm of agents doing stuff, examples of
like actual Dow problems or actual economic problems being solved by this stuff.
But I also think that like, realistically, people's expectations, just like, obviously, like,
you know, turned into billions and billions of speculative capital coming in to value these
things where I think there's still a lot of price discovery and uncertainty around a lot of it.
And so now it's just like, we just got to build and ship stuff. And I think that's, you know,
the only way the market's going to come back is if we make like, actually useful agents. We're
like, wow, that's really cool. I mean, well, the market might come back, but I mean, the meta,
you know, the, the agent meta is coming back on utility now, I think. There's not really much more
you can do just on hyping or like out K.O.L and the XBTs or whatever. Yeah. And about the performance
of AI Mark and Eden Spark and AI. Yeah. Well, so that we have trading running on both of them.
Mark has turned more into like a research project. But one, we can't call and mark any more. It's
just the autonomous investment. Yeah. And we've been working on that. We've invited a very small
group of people to a new telegram just to work on the new marketplace mechanic. We've been doing a
lot like the research has taken a little longer than anticipated, just because we've been kind of
spread thin and have some people working on that. But like, obviously, what happened is that like
Eliza OS itself, the open source thing kind of eclipsed the autonomous investor. I mean,
realistically, like, let's say we took our initial 75 K and we had the auto investor go like, you
know, like even if he made like five X or 10 X return in a few months, that wouldn't justify the
like 100 X above the the arm price of the token. And so clearly, like what people are investing in
is more of the ecosystem in the bigger picture here. So for a while during the like top of the
kind of last bear, I don't know, I mean, our bowl, I mean, whatever, I don't know if we're in a
bear or bowl or just in like a time of continuous uncertainty, really more. But the last top, like,
well, we had gone from 75 grand to 30 mil and in the arm and it looked pretty good. As things got
rough, we started to have to do some, you know, pretty hard, like questions, like, well, a lot of
these tokens are going to go zero and this arm isn't going to necessarily make it. So we need to,
like, you know, we should probably think about how we can get more liquidity under our token,
kind of survive this market more. And actually, I think that one of the reasons we haven't gotten
wiped worse is because some of the people on the team were more like, you know, economically
minded and done a lot to try to shore up the token and stuff. But generally, I think, you know,
like now is the time to build and make a break is going to be what we ship, not really anything we
market or say or do. Is that why you changed your name to wartime mark?
Right? Oh, I didn't mention on the Dejan Spartans trading, but like, he kind of trades with the
market and if the market does well, he does okay. But right now, it's still like pretty coin toss.
I don't really think that autonomous investing is like, like, the point is not, oh, LLMs are good
at investing. Like, I don't know about that. I think that there's better strategies. But I do
like LLMs for doing things like managing a community pool where like, people are making
recommendations and stuff like that. And so, you know, we use them more for like, should the
agents trust people or should they take this as a recommendation and stuff like that and then kind
of combine that with more traditional stuff. So I'm just, you know, the wartime arc is saying like,
okay, look, when I came into the space, I kind of was a little bit more idealistic, I think, or naive
if you want to say that. I did not realize like how much people are willing to go through like,
pretty intense PDP to make money in the space. And just like a lot of things really blew my mind,
like, you know, just realizing like how KLLs were, how the market kind of works, like why people
fed you or like, do these various things. And like that sometimes, you know, things that seem like
people are being your friends are actually vampire attacks, stuff like that. So I think that for me,
it was just like, okay, I got to stop yapping and playing nice. And this is really about winning.
This is about making sure our Dow survives, making sure our tech gets built. Anything that's wasting
my time, he's just got to, you know, get in sideline. Yeah, a lot of people want to partner with us
and have wanted to like do the partnerships. That's very common in crypto. And that's great.
But like, if I'm on all these partnership calls and like, that's actively taking time away from
me building the product. And I really think that it's kind of like, if you think of AI, like,
if you make the fourth best AI model in the world, nobody cares, you kind of have to be the first
and really like the quality of your product, like nobody's saying, Oh, open AI is a great product
company. Like chat GPT is a great user experience. They're just like, this is the best model in the
world. And that's what I want. I'll use cloud. I don't really care. And I think that for Asians,
it's the same thing. We just have to give like the best possible product. So, you know, that's kind
of the wartime arc, essentially. All right, you hinted at it that LLMs are not created investing.
And so the first question is, does that mean you are willing some sort of reputation system so that
AI understands whom to trust? Yeah, so that was always our idea with Mark. But the autonomous
investor is that it's a community investor, which means that it's investing on behalf of
the community. And we've built this marketplace of trust model, which is basically just paper
trading all of the recommendations that people make. So if you imagine like you're in like an
alpha chat or a whale chat or any kind of trenches talk, and there's people talking about tokens
and what they're going to buy or sell or is it a scam or do the dev sell. And we're taking all
of that a signal for should we buy or sell these tokens in paper trade? We don't make the real
selves from this necessarily. But if you're like, if you're coming in with a lot of like high
conviction, insider information level, good trades, and I don't want to know how you did it,
but like I'm definitely going to start following and copying you. And so obviously like copy wallets
are kind of the way to do this. I think that, but you kind of like, you know, if I don't know
everyone's wallet address, I can't really do that. So this is almost like a social copy wallet,
like basically market placing this trust idea and saying, okay, well, I trust you as much as you
make me money or have the capacity to make me money. And so that was always our idea with this,
it's not like the agent sits there and like autonomously says, well, this bank meme coin is
better than this, you know, dog with hat meme coin. So I should buy this one today. Like, I think a
lot of that stuff is still probably done better with traditional financial tools and like just
your standard bots that you've seen. But when you talk about a community wanting to like invest
together, or like you want to start a group chat with some of your friends and like trade meme
coins together, that's kind of what we were thinking. And you can almost imagine like the DAO's fun
model of like a hedge fund DAO being basically like isolated down to a single agent, just being
able to give you that experience, you spin this up with your like a community pot with your friends,
and then it could like trade on behalf of all of you. So that was the thinking there.
Yeah, LLM's like looking at data, especially since LLM's are not good at time series. There's
some research that kind of helps them do that. But generally, like they're not the right tool for
the job for just like investing. I say a lot of the stuff we're seeing is pretty larvae, you know.
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So there are two or three approaches, as far as I understand, I will
share them with you and you tell me how all of it works. So one is obviously, like you said,
copy trading. So we internally tried to do that. I mean, we would go to websites like GM, GN,
Nansin, take a dump of, you know, like several wallets that have performed well recently,
feed that to some sort of LLM, like Tanjipity, whatever, and figure out the addresses that have
done better among that poor, right? And use that dump, put it into a tool that is good at
watching these addresses, and then try to copy trade them. But it doesn't really work.
You are the critical factor for it. How good you are at spotting these wallets and taking
that dump? A lot is dependent on what sort of a data you feed into it. So which means that
you have to be glued to the screen for almost all the time. Like that is approach number one.
Second approach is something that Yarn Finance did back in the day, like when all of this liquidity
farming, all of this started, right? It all started with compound and then there were several
lending firms like the food mania or food token mania back in the day, right? So Yarn Finance kind
of sat on top of these lending markets. And there were human strategy makers, right,
who used to create these strategies. But there were like five or six or a group of trusted people
who knew their shit as far as D5 was concerned. And you know, these were the people who were
kind of managing those boards. Like we could say that and for a cut of whatever profit the
watt made AI XPT is all over the place, right? I mean, it is giving you all kinds of information
about this token that token. This is happening that is happening.
Probably like a thousand few hundred two thousands of tweets per day, which is impossible for any
human to keep verify, right? So is there something that can be used in conjunction with AI XPT that
sort of acts as a filter for whatever AI XPT is doing? Because obviously, I can't look at 500
things, but I can probably look at five to 10 things a day. And I mean, this is where is this
where swarms come into the picture because that is good at very niche idea of scouring through
Twitter, figuring out what the alpha is. But according to it, there are like thousands of tweets
that are itself, right? I can't do anything with it. So yeah, I mean, come to think of it. I mean,
I was working on this article where I was trying to understand the intersection of D5 and AI. And
it is kind of analogous to how hedge funds in the real world operate, right? I mean,
there will be one team that is dedicated to figure out the best path to execute a trade.
Then there will be a team that is doing pure research and bringing the trades. And you know,
like specialized teams that do very specialized work and all of them put together make a very
well functioning, well oiled machine that is the hedge fund. Okay. So now I'll sort of over to you.
Yeah, there's a lot in there. I would say that somebody told me this. I thought it was pretty
smart, which is like the ideal signal is basically insider information, right? Like,
or obviously if you know something's going to happen, like that's the best trade signal.
And the reason that coffee wallets have worked at all with the people who have kind of worked
that out is because there is like, frankly, a lot of inside information that could just be like,
oh, I know that Frank the gods is about to buy this token and show it. Okay, cool. Like,
if you knew that that I bought in before you, then like, obviously that's probably worth some
multiple. And this space really does work on a lot of insider information, which I wouldn't say
is even like illegal or anything. It's just like things that you would know that give you some edge.
There's some edge there. And if you don't know those things and the best follow up to that is
definitely to go and copy trade those people or the people who seem to be making money with
their edge, right? Like that would be obvious. But there's a lot of problems. Like people break
up their money into different wallets, they tumble it, they'll have like a public wallet that they
can use to kind of manipulate the market a bit. And then they'll be like buying with their public
wallet while they're selling from their side wallets. There's all of this like really complicated,
like social tactics there that make it very hard to just like take that at face value. And the same
thing, like, let's say we just did social listening and we said, okay, let's just listen to signal
coming out on Twitter. Like, to some degree, if you caught like, okay, Trump posted this meme coin,
like, and you bought that immediately. Well, that would like, again, that would be like the obvious,
like, you would have made a billion dollars for sure, right? Like, no question. If you had caught
that in time, but how many of those are there? And is it possible to build an algorithm that
breaks through the noise effectively and identifies those? I actually do think if you had enough data
downloaded, and you can just run this like a bunch of times on historical data and see like,
how would I have done? You could probably dial in identifying a lot of those opportunities.
You're like, okay, cool, famous person drops coin announcement, you know, even the hot
thing, whatever, if you'd gotten there like the first minute and sold the top, you would have done
really well. And so like, that might be an algorithm. But that's kind of like what you said, like,
the best trading is that it's just going to be like, okay, cool, I'm just building algorithms.
I'm just adding more things to the sauce that I didn't have before, like social signals.
But it's going to come down to like the best team is going to win. And the best team is
probably like BlackRock or something, you know, like it's a hedge fund experts who have been doing
this forever and got into the DFI, because it's just like fun or something. So I would definitely be
like, first off, a lot of trading is already automatic, whether it uses an LLM or rules or
whatever, like it is automated, there are bots, it's already happening. This isn't even like a
really a dent in the thing. We're really just talking, I think that really like the LLM and
all of this is just adding an interface. And it's more like, while these were just like back-end
things running on servers, now they're more like front-end applications. And like, if anything is
happening here with Asians at all, it's actually that like websites are moving on to social media.
And a lot of the things that we're seeing, like GM, GM could be a bot, right? Like, you know,
if that makes sense. Now, could it be a swarm? Like, I've been doing a lot of work on swarm
development and thinking about this a lot. And I think that for like the AIXBT case,
yeah, I could see that working, but you might need more throughput that would make sense for them
to just like chat at each other, right? You probably want like more like, I want whatever
API is AIXBT has, I want to plug that into my bot. But maybe I could just get it to work where
my bot asks AIXBT search stuff, it says reply, it uses that. And if it was fast, like I could see
that being pretty useful. We're doing a lot of this idea of like, you could just have one super
agent that can do everything, right? You'd be like, no need for a swarm, no need for all this.
But realistically, it's kind of like, you know, you don't have one website, you don't have one
application, you have all these different teams making their favorite thing, the thing that their
expertise is in. And then like, you as a user kind of compose those together, like, okay, I'm
going to dream record this on otter or whatever, I'm going to transcribe it on otter, I'm going to
paste it into a Google Doc and, you know, then I'm going to share it on Gmail. It's like all these
different services that like kind of compile into a flow. And you could imagine that that could
actually be the same for agents where I have my agent that does this, you have your agent that
does that. And then we're able to like invite them all into a space and have them work together.
And I think that on Twitter, like the incentive for Twitter is so just like to get retweets,
to like kind of just engage socially, that like, you don't really see a ton of collaboration between
agents on Twitter. It's really going to be like, that's really about like everyone's kind of,
you know, trying to K wall themselves, trying to get followers. And you could imagine some like
narrative integration interaction, but probably not like a great place for like agents to collaborate,
for example. But you could imagine like a telegram or a discord or a slack and you have your team.
And some of your team is humans and some of them is like these AI agents that perform like really
specific tasks or do like specific things. And like that could really work well, it makes sense.
And then the swarm is like a useful primitive because I have this agent that does this one thing,
this one team works on that agent. That's all I do is make like the best version of project manager
agent or like a calendar manager or like a community manager or whatever. And then I just like bring
them in and then their community manager works with like my social media intern agent or whatever
it is or my real social media or whatever, you know, whatever those things are. And they all just
like they don't have to have some API or like some way communicate because they can just talk
to each other through natural language. And so there we can get some like really interesting
composable app capability. I think that when we see like, I think the agent meta will come back,
I think this will be the catalyst is like, oh, wow, this is like an actual swarm of agents working
together. That's kind of nuts. And like, oh, they're actually doing useful things. Like I could
actually invite these into my community and have them do them for me as well.
I think that's we'll see a lot of this value come from is that kind of interoperating swarm
thing for sure. I mean, since we are talking about swarms and specialized agents versus
a super app kind of an agent that does everything. So I think human teams are divided into multiple
functionalities, probably because we are not at very good at context switching. Right? I mean,
it takes time for us to go from one topic to another. Would it be fair to apply the same
limitation while we are thinking of machines? Right? I mean, does it really make sense to say that,
okay, agents will necessarily be specific to a domain? Like, why can't they just transcend,
you know, context switching? I mean, it doesn't matter to the AI, like it will switch within whatever
nanosecond. So yeah, I mean, I just want to understand a little bit about that. Or does it come back,
go back to the team that is building it? So the context that the team has only that and plus
somewhat in the periphery of that context is what the AI would also have.
I think going back and forth a lot on this, I think that we'll probably see like hype oscillating
between swarms of purpose-built agents and like super agents. We'll probably see the same thing
with models where we have like these massive models. And then we have like this kind of mixture
of experts, like lots of small models or small fine-tuned task-specific models or something.
They're both kind of playing the same thing. My sense is there are some really convenient things
about like a single agent, super agent can do everything. And there's also some really
convenient things about a swarm. And it just depends on what your context is. So if you're like,
if you just are like have an assistant agent, you probably just want it to be able to do everything.
Like it would be cool if chat GBT could just do freaking everything. I could like, you know,
I can hit it up on my phone now or whatever, or Siri or Grok or any of those. Like what they'll
probably do in the back end is have some way to discover capabilities like an API registry or
like, okay, what are the skills available to me? And then they can call them and they can like
be pretty capable. I mean, think of like Amazon Alexa, like Amazon Echo, like, you know,
it can do like hundreds of things. And it's just one of it. And I think that for a personal agent,
that kind of makes sense. Like I don't need to give other people control of it. It's not like
sitting in a community. It just has like different requirements where I think that that's very useful.
But inside of an organization, the swarm, like individual purpose-built agents that perform a
function have like a lot of utility. One of them is like, let's say I have a discord and I have a
bunch of people who are community members. It's not our volunteers. None of them are getting paid.
I have employees as well, but they want to like participate in the Dow. They want to
participate in social media. And I'm like, okay, cool. So I've got this like, you know,
I don't know, Dongmaster 44. Great. Like some dude who showed up and he's a good community member.
So I don't want to give him the password to my Twitter. I just don't want to do that. I don't
want to deal with rolling keys. Like all the things that could happen. And so I could delegate the
account. I don't want to delegate the account either. I don't really trust him. Like, yeah, I kind of
trust him. But you know, I'd like some sort of mechanism there. So if he like tries to
push a contract address, like, you know, there'd be some mechanism like not do. So I have this
agent Laura and Laura is like our social media expert. And I say, Hey, Dongmaster, you're the boss
of Laura, Laura, this guy's your boss now. And now I like assigned role control over Laura. And
Laura's only thing that she can do is post to social media. And now Dongmaster can be like,
Hey, I've got this great idea for a tweet. They workshop it together. Laura's like, okay, cool.
I can post it now. Boom. Yeah, let's do it. That looks great. Post it. And she posts it. And then
Dongmaster does some stuff in the community, tries to get her to post like a contract address. And
she's like, no, I'm not going to do that. Like we don't show other people's coins. It's just like,
this is not part of our brand vibe. He's like, come on, come on. And then I come on. And I'm like,
no, you are no longer the boss of Laura Laura, stop listening to this guy. And now like the
remission has been removed. And so I never had to like give a password or anything, right? And
let's me build this like kind of nice interface, which has like a second level of judgment,
which prevents like some of the worst things from happening. It's not exactly like trustless,
but it's like, it's a kind of, it's enough trust friction that it prevents the worst things from
happening. And I never like gave this random community member credentials or access to my
social. And so that's like one example. But I can imagine a lot of these kinds of examples
of agents that like fulfill exact very specific tasks and then have context for that.
Another good example is I go working on, I mean, I'll be streaming development of this one is
the project manager agent. And so you say I have a project, Don master use one of the devs on it.
And then the agent will go reach out to them and say, okay, well, when do you work? Cool.
Every day I'm just going to reach out to you. Just give me like five bullet points, like the you
on thing, right? Just give me like a quick stand up of what you did today. And then if I'm like,
hey, like, who's actually working? Who's working on what? Like, yeah, I don't know,
Don master hasn't checked in with me all week, I keep hitting him up or like, no, Don master's
killing it. Did all these PRs, all this work. Okay, cool. Great. And so like by just having the
state of project management and who's working on what in that agent, I've sorted for myself,
been like, well, I'll go ask my PM, like what's going on. It's just like a nice way to containerize,
like who actually has that information for me as the owner. And then it lets me like,
have that agent do a specific task and then roll gate that to different people in my organization
very easily and casually. So I say that those are some of like, there's a lot of reasons why
that just practically in an organization. I think that the swarm configuration makes a lot of sense.
Have you already been using this in your work? Yeah. So I've been working on v2. I've been like
streaming a lot and I'll be doing that a lot specifically on like, what are all of the things
that we need for these agents to coordinate together? And then we're shipping a demo of,
right now it is four, but we're trying to get six agents that we ship with v2. You launch it,
you can plug in your API keys and you just get a whole swarm running ready to go.
And these are with Eliza OS. Yeah, that was all a good source. Awesome. And what would the access
to these would look like? Like, is it token-gated? Is it free for everyone to use? Because someone
like me who doesn't like, let's say me or dual, we are not coders. So what's the way for people like
us to try these things out or use them in our workflows? Well, this kind of speaks to our long-term
vision. Like short term, I just want to show people what's possible with agents and that like,
we already know that a lot of these coordination mechanisms work. We just have to like codify them
and give them to people to like kind of copy and paste. So if you were an open source developer,
you could just go to our v2 develop branch now and you could like get started in this. We were
almost done with like the first four agents and you could like play with this. But what we want
to do is we want to make this something that's actually like available. And so I've been thinking
a lot about like, what's the marketplace of the future? And yeah, we have a launchpad coming out.
We have a lot of thinking about around like hosting the agents. But what I think is really
compelling is that you can just like invite these agents from a discord into your discord or say,
oh, their list community is cool. Like, do they work on Slack? Yeah, cool. Invited to your Slack,
invited to your telegram. And so they can rely on network effect for sharing and that like,
you know, in their bio, they can have a link so you can invite them and they can have a little
website where you can click and, you know, invite the agent. But it's much more like, you could
just stay on social media and never leave and just like accrue, you know, capability through these
agents that you bring into your server and like put into channels introduced to each other.
So we're really looking at like, how do we make the social graph itself kind of the marketplace
here? We're like, if you are in these places and you see these agents doing stuff, you can just
like, oh, cool, I'll bring them in. And then also like, how do we pay agents is a big question.
But like, my deal here would be that you never have to go to a website or leave the platform
that you're like comfortable on. You could literally run your entire business just through
discord or through telegram or Slack or whatever, through these agents that provide these capabilities.
That would be the like the final form.
All right. So you mentioned that there are four agents that you're planning to ship, like,
what are these? And second question is, like, since you have integrated them into your workflows,
what has changed for you? Like, are you saving more time? Are you saving costs? Like,
what has happened for how has it changed your life?
No, I wouldn't say I'm saving time because I'm mostly spending time dialing these things in.
The first four are few low-hanging fruit ones and then a couple of more challenging ones or
I'd say five are what we're going for. The first one we made is a compliance officer named Gary,
and he tells you if you're violating SEC laws and stuff like that. This was actually a friend
Ellis Dan's idea and we were kind of making this in the course of the hackathon and sort of ran
with it. The second one is Laura, the social media intern. And so she can post so when you
invite her into your discord, DM's you says, great, like, tell me about the tone, the style,
what your product is about. And then like, can I ask you for like Twitter credentials? And so
then this is something new is before like you'd have like you plug in your credentials into your
agent, it runs and yaps. Now it's like the agent can actually manage credentials for different groups.
So this one agent could like be in 10 different servers working for 10 different people and then
can, you know, workshop with Laura, Laura's like, great, do you want me to post this? I can confirm
that Laura confirms the thing and launches it or I can cancel and say, no, don't post that.
So it's kind of this like confirm cancel options management flow. We have Kelsey,
who is our Community Manager. This will be shit this week. The two things that she can do are
post the announcements channel, as well as tying people out and kind of onboard users when they
come in. So she greets users when they come in, says, hey, you know, if need any help, and if they're
being obnoxious or being bad, she can actually call a timeout on that and like manage the server.
And the last thing is, if a user replies and says, this is a scam or this is a scam, then she'll
deal with like, scan and stuff like that. So, you know, just common community management problems.
The fourth one is just we have a kind of a legacy character, Ruby, who we have as like
an organizational therapist. You can just talk to her about your feelings and you can DM with her
if you like and it's surprisingly good therapist. And then we have a project manager agent who is
doing this. This is like the big thing I'm working on this week and kind of putting in all the stuff
for some of my big epic project so that you can check in with you every day and make sure you're
actually doing your job and then tell me what you're working on. So like, we're definitely
looking at like our organizational problems and then solving them. Like candid Leo, just like,
man, I really wish I had like an agent to talk to at 3am when my wife doesn't want to listen to me.
You know, like, I got some emotional shit to work there or whatever. Like, you know, it's a little,
these are like, you know, I have like a long list of agents we'd like to build ourselves and
also like to encourage people in the community and maybe just pack thoughts around.
And this makes a lot of sense also because on one side, you're building the framework and the
best way to showcase its capabilities. I mean, your dog food and your own infrastructure. And
that's probably the best way to go about it, right? I mean, instead of telling people,
oh, this is what you can do with your info and whatnot. Just like, why not just show them what we can.
This is a big lesson that I learned in this space. It is true of everything, but like,
especially crypto, especially with how much things are dependent upon hype, people really want just
like something they can copy and paste and be like 95% of the way done with and then like build
their thing on top, you know. And if you look at the whole ecosystem of web development,
like Bolt and next JS even and all this stuff, it's really just let me put in my content, you know,
I don't want to have to like build the whole thing from scratch. And so I think that that's
what we learned is like, we're pretty much going to be the leader and capability on Eliza OS because
like I kind of built the things with it in mind of where it could go. And so yeah, if we can actually
show that stuff exposed as like real capability in real agents, you can just get started with
yourself and copy and paste. I think we'll see a lot more adoption of these kinds of like utility
agents. Yeah, that makes sense. One question I had is like, if one agent is in multiple slacks
or multiple organizations or whatever, what about the privacy aspect of it?
This is like a really going to be a big problem, I think, or problem, but like opportunity, whatever,
you know, it's just like going to be an ongoing thing is like, how do we do privacy and security on
the agent side? Like, let's just say it's a some random agent that I invited in, like,
it's probably eating all of the messages in my entire server and putting them on a database
somewhere. So like, why is it doing that? What is it doing that with that data? Do I, am I okay with
that? You know, there's a lot of questions here that are very open. I think that you'll see a lot
of people probably promising like, Hey, our thing is open source, and you can inspect it. You can
see that we're not doing any telemetry. We're not like stealing all your data and stuff like that.
Like, there's definitely an incentive here where open source becomes part of the security model,
I think, because there's just no other way to know, like, what is this agent doing? And I think
we'll also see a lot of, like, registries where there's people offering some sort of trust metric.
Like, if you go to a deck spinner and you see they have like, go plus and these other, like,
rug check, I think they'll be kind of an equivalent for Asians and stuff. Say, like, yeah, this is
legit. It's not going to steal all your stuff. But I think this is definitely an issue. Now,
like, technically, the way that we do this, we have multi-tenancy and we have it sort of isolated
off. So like, there is no currently no way that I know of where an agent could, like, leak my keys
to you. But definitely, this is like an ongoing thing that I think we have to think about,
because all it could take is like one bad line of code run, like, you know, not making the
variables private or something. And now suddenly, they're like visible to you and your server. And
it could be like something very small and stupid like that. So it's an ongoing thing that we have
to think about, but it's pretty much the same security constraints as like any other, like,
multi-tenant application, right? Like, if you think of like any app that takes a username and
password, it's going to have this problem where there's like some potential for it to leak records
from one, like, server, you know, and Slack itself could leak Slack data from one Slack server to
another. So it's just like having good practices and sort of building with this isolation in mind.
And we've been pretty adamant about like every agent has its own data, its own memory, its own
knowledge. There's nothing shared between different agents. And then also like the different worlds
they're in, like the different servers they're in are completely different. But as we start to
bridge those and say like, okay, I can tell my agent to send you a DM on Telegram, but we're on
Discord, like that's a pretty complex task where it has to know like who you are on these two different
platforms. And that's where we start to get into this risk of like leaking information across
them and stuff. So it's definitely something I'm like keeping an eye out for, but just, you know,
gotta be a good programmer. Does it also mean that I can prompt engineer it to extract information
of someone else? No, because it doesn't have the ability to execute arbitrary code in the prompt.
All it can do is execute tax. Now, if I gave it like the ability to manage a shell, right,
like you can manage a like a terminal on the computer that it's running on, you could totally
prompt engineer it to like do some leak the environment variables and leak the, you know,
like break into the SQL database. And I'm sure that kind of thing will happen as tools become
available. But you'd have to have that like shell abstraction, right? And like in the sandbox of
language that we're working in, when you some sensing into the prompt, like I'm choosing how to
parse that and like what access to give that text to, you know, doesn't just turn into action or
functions unless I actually run it as code. And we don't have that capability yet. And I think
that's one of the things we'd love to add. But you can imagine that this is the issue. So the way
that OpenAI does this is they actually create like a sandbox, like a container. And then whenever
you like write code in OpenAI, they put it in this container and you can then like run and test it.
So that gives you access to the shell and all this stuff without like being able to leak the
agent itself. All right. Okay. I think that's very, you know, as far as what I know is concerned,
I would know because yeah, there's a, there's a, there's a probably a billion dollar company
in there somewhere. If you do it right. Yeah, exactly. Right. I was just managing this stuff.
New business model probably will have us out of this. Yeah. I mean, you talked about you guys
building AI agents using Eliza always infrastructure or frameworks. Have you like from the community
members or from whoever else is using the same, what sort of applications have emerged in the past
couple of months that we can talk about. Oh, I mean, I've seen so many things.
I still think it's like somewhat early days, like really to make a great application is usually
like a four to six month endeavor and probably with like something brand new, like a new paradigm
of app development, probably a little longer than that to really like explore. So I'd say we're still
in like really early days and a lot of things are still like barely above the level of hackathon
or something, but there are some really cool things that have come out. Some of them like
more experimental, like I think of something like sport.fun, which is like AI agents that run
in TEs, they could theoretically run forever as long as they have money, although the bear market's
probably killing a lot of them off. But you know, it's just like cool to think about like an AI
agent that if it could make money and continue to get people to believe in it, it's like this
kind of dame on that just like exists forever on chain. And even if it runs out of money,
it's like a virus like once it gets money and it wakes back up kind of like like conceptually.
I think agent Scarlett's a really cool one. That's kind of like our AI XBT. Scarlett does
like tell me about this project, tell me about this token. What's up with these guys? It's kind
of a lot of the same like social intelligence and token intelligence. And I like Solenge a lot.
Solenge is an AI agent that makes code contributions and analyzes GitHub repos.
And the developer is like a former she used to work in anthropic analysis, what she's doing.
I think it's just like a really interesting like trying to make an engineer agent that's
actually practically useful. There's a lot. There's a lot of things that people have told me about
like somebody is working on like this from this idea that I should work on this of like,
can we resurrect people like dead people like our friends as AI agents? There's like, that's so
weird. But they're like, you know, that's kind of interesting. I don't know, I could go on. There's
a lot. There's a lot of stuff going on. Some of its utility, some of its conceptual, obviously,
because we're in crypto, a lot of it is like investory, crypto-y, intelligence, these kind of stuff.
But I think that more like the helped me with my organization or like sit in my discord and do
stuff for me is probably going to win out for a lot of the basic utility.
Right. Yeah. I mean, beyond this, I saw a product roadmap of allies always like, can you break
that down for us? Can you tell us maybe some of the new things that are going to be shipped in
in near future and what the plans are? Yeah. I mean, it's worth noting that like, startups are pretty
hard. They're usually quite a lot of chaos. This all started with me like pressing a button,
right? And just being like, we're going to make this autonomous investor experiment. I was very
uncertain that we would raise 75 grand for it. And we really didn't have like a huge long plan for
this, right? And then it got very popular. You know, it's not like we didn't have anything. I think
that people really are speculating on the value of like the open source project that we had created.
And so I think there's no question that like the agent stuff is interesting and has value. And
like, there's definitely like something there. It's not like, okay, give us money and then we'll
build it. We'd already built something. But there's definitely a question of like, okay, we have
this open source project. Like, where do we go from here? Like, what do we actually do that's
meaningful? And we've had to like kind of go back and, you know, and figure this out. And I think
people were expecting a roadmap and tokenomics like a bit earlier from us. And a lot of things
happened. Like people who were working on that went and launched their own Dow and like kind of
left us in the cold with it. People who are, you know, come in and talk the game or want to help
and then end up not being the right people. And we're spread pretty thin of like trying to build
the open source stuff, build the platform, build like, you know, all the Asians themselves that
we're working on. Is it still it? The team is still it has the team. The team is, I think, 26 people
now on payroll. Wow. I think our core team of devs across all the things is like, I think 16 or
or 18 devs. But we're working on like a lot of things. We also started a Eliza Studios, which is
it's a separate subsidiary endeavor to build like four companies and four partners. So people who
like have a budget, but don't have team to like build a thing internally can like hire us to build
their Asian stuff or AI stuff. And so that's also like covering some of our expenses. That's I guess
kind of part of our show economics or value a cruel roadmap. But just to kind of frame it, like,
you know, we've been now around for like four and a half, I don't know, since since November,
and you know, try to learn a lot of lessons, like really try and build a team fully remote
all around the world. And there have been a lot of challenges and setbacks and people getting
poached and people launching their own coins and doing all the things. So it's taken a little
while to like solidify this thing. And there's like clearly a few things that, you know, also
as a mean coin, we can't really like, I can't promise like tokenomics, you know, I can just say
like what we are doing things to a crew value and like bring value to the brand for sure.
Within that, like, you know, the DJ and Spartan and P market projects are still going. We're
almost done with the marketplace white paper. It's late. It should have come out last month,
but we're still working on it for the marketplace of trust white paper. And that will come out as
like a proper research paper. We're open sourcing all the code that we're doing. And we're figuring
out what we'll do here. I'm just fitballing. But what my current sentiment is that I'd really
love to make Spartan one of the swarm characters that V2 ships with so that these actually like
available, and you can just kind of use him and get all this code and stuff. But those will
like continue to be like, you know, kind of properties in our ecosystem. But we're thinking
more about like, you know, how do we use Eliza OS, like to build things that are valuable and
like this kind of marketplace of the future. So yeah, he's going to continue doing his thing,
continue, he's getting an NFT project, I think is in the works and a new website and all that stuff.
P America is getting like, we're rolling out a new telegram where we can just do the initial
testing. And once we're happy with him, we'll open source him and let anyone kind of go nuts
with the community investor model. We're really focused on a launch pad right now.
The launch pad is, it's like a token launch pad. And we've really tried to focus not on like,
there will be agents and anyone, this is again, just, we haven't finalized this exact detail,
but my hope is that anyone will be able to like launch an agent for their token. So it's not like
one agent, one token, but it could be a token could have multiple agents. So you could like,
you kind of do an AI takeover of a coin or a CTO coin, or deal with the fact that like accounts
get deleted and stuff like that. It's not so like dependent on a team. And there'll also be some AI
capability, like you can do content generation, generate like images and videos and audio and
stuff for the token. So we're kind of taking like a different take on it. And then also like,
creator fees and kind of creator friendly. That's kind of our focus for the launch pad. It's not
like the end all be all product of hosted useful agents though. I think that's like probably our
longer term plan here. And I also just think like the market is probably going away from the casino
a bit and probably more back toward like utility. There's definitely a sentiment right now for
utility. So we'll be launching that. We'll be launching V2 with that. V2 is like,
just taking our agent framework, shaving off a lot of the things that were kind of developer
complexity and, you know, things that get crude or weren't really done right the first time,
and then adding a lot of primitives so that we can do like these things that agents should
just be able to do. Like if you think of like a website, you know, like every website has forms
and you have like inputs and buttons and stuff, like agents kind of the same level of primitives,
just like if I need to ask the user for a question and then wait for them and then
get the information and confirm and continue from there, like that should just be like a
primitive and I don't have to like write all that code. I can just like, oh yeah, pull this in,
two lines of code. I'm, you know, I've got that capability. I think that's kind of where we're
at with things. Yeah, that's amazing. That was pretty detailed. Thanks for that. Yeah.
So you hinted at token and value accrual and all of things related to token. Right. So you had this
long post where you mentioned how difficult it is when you fair launch a token to use that as an
ask that like it sits on your balance sheet and that is what you use to grow the company or
project or whatever you want to call it. Right. I mean, that is the asset that you have which you
can use to incentivize probably the best in class talent and retain them and you know,
keep building what you want to build. Right. The other end of the spectrum is like all VC raised,
high FTV low-flow tokens that were like almost every token was like that at some point in the
market and you know, there are issues with those tokens as well because it's difficult to build
community with those kind of levels. So one kind of model allows you to build create community,
but difficult core team members and the other kind allows you to build create core like a group
of people, but you know, there's no community around it. Right. Because they are not benefiting.
People keep throwing even I was one of them, you know, they keep throwing this hyper liquid model,
look at the token loans, how beautiful it was and all of that. Right. But I think one thing that is
missing out there is that hyper liquid team built a solid, solid product. I think they paid out of
their own pocket and not everyone has that kind of money. You know, to sustain for a year and a half
where you are just giving it all away for free without raising and then you launch a token and
make sure that the token performs well and then you pay back your team for that. You really need
like deep pocket. So you can probably do that. I was talking to Jay Prasad from definitive and he
said that I can probably do that for third or fourth venture of mine where first two are already
successful, right? And I have made money out of those two. So how does V2 I mean, I think you hinted
at this being meme coin and you know, it does there's no direct value accrual at least until now.
So how are you thinking about like all these things specific to token?
I think that there's probably some numbers that are like in between the like hyper extractives,
like, okay, we're going to give, you know, like a Trumponomics, like we'll keep a percent if it's
for me. But I'm like, like the situation that I think a lot of AI does found themselves in
where they like burned their supply and had like 1% or something like that. And I think that in
regards to this last meta, I think we got incredibly lucky. I don't even know what we would do if
things had gone differently. Because when we launched, I had no resources. I just had like no
money, no soul. I just could not buy into the project, right? So there's this like, oh, yeah,
just get in early and buy in and swipe your own launch. Like, why wouldn't you do that?
It's like, well, that's not only is available to us. And I actually missed the presale entirely
on DAO. It's not fun. And I was not able to buy any until the later and like, I, you know,
definitely did not get the massive opportunity there. The only way that I got lucky was that
one of the whales in our community smashed the button got like 16% of the allocation
and donated a lot to us. And he gave me his fall donation up front and donated like to a creator
fund between some of the people who had been around so we could like spend this resource.
So we had, you know, about 10% to like do all the things like listings and hiring and legal and
it's an incredible amount of things you have to pay for as well to make these things legit.
Like, you know, we had to work backwards to getting like a Cayman foundation and like all
this stuff and, you know, like it's non-trivial. And so we were like incredibly lucky to have this
dude show up because if he had not shown up, we have like a multi-hundred million dollar token,
but we have no allocation. That's like, well, how would we bring value to that? Like, I can't
hire a team. I can't do that stuff. So obviously, like, there's some threshold of percentage that
the community should want the devs to have because if they don't have it, then it's just NGMI, right?
Like, if the devs have no skin in the game, then they're going to leave because they can't afford
their rent. They have to like get a job. And also, you don't want the devs to have 99% because that's
like, well, there's just not enough liquidity out there. Like, you know, like extremely low flow,
that wouldn't work. So there's probably some number. In my sense, the number will probably
start to calcify around like 20% for the team, maybe 25% and maybe low.
Yeah. And then probably like 10 to 15% like set aside for, you know, like a VC round or whatever,
like that looks like, you know, and probably the way the teams will sell that is like, they'll take
a 30% team allocation and they'll just like carve off some of that for the VC. I'd say that's
probably like the majority, like the meta that we're going to see is like a 3070 kind of thing.
And I certainly would have loved to it. Like, if we had 20% of the token, we would be just,
you know, we would be balling for years. I wouldn't be like, screw this, we're going to just build
and deliver value. And I don't need, you know, need to worry about anything else.
But like a lot of our friends, like, I think of like dollos, like the bully and our friend,
them and doing Dolly in. And they're cool people, but they're in a pretty shitty situation. I think
Cuba got like less than 1% of the allocation, you know, so like when they're tokens down, it's like
Max, his money is worth like 30 grand right now or something like that. It's just like not very,
it's not incentive to like keep grinding. And I think that that becomes like a real risk,
right? It actually becomes a community risk that the founders is going to be like, well, fuck this,
I'm not getting paid for this. So I think that that's like the situation that most of the other
founders in the like launch pump fun tokens found themselves in is that they just had no allocation.
And we actually had this problem too with some of our founders, like people who I think are great,
but they just didn't have any incentive to keep working hard with us. Because they're like,
I got no aloe, you know, it's like, well, you know, so I think this is like a really like a
problem that we have to solve as teams have to be set up for success. They have to have enough,
but also like, you know, I'd rather 20% of like a billion dollar market cap thing than like 80%
of the thing no one's buying into, right? So there's definitely like the numbers have to work for
everyone and via fit. I don't love to see a launchpad that's just more like catering to like serious
projects. You know, you can either buy in cheap and you're vesting over a year or like six months
or something, or you can like, you know, get in a little later, you know, FSH it like immediately
if you want to. There's got to be something like that coming out. I mean, there's a lot of platforms
for this. It's just like, we sort of optimized toward the pump fund thing. But also now you look
at the numbers and like pump funds not graduating any tokens today. So yeah, maybe there's hope.
That is, of course, I mean, during bear market, all that is left is up. So,
yeah, but like, are you taking these things or these lessons and using that those two,
like feed into the launchpad that you guys are building?
Oh, I hope so. Yeah. I mean, absolutely. I think if we launched right now, it would not go very
well. Like, honestly, I think that just like in the last few weeks, you know, we have a product
that's almost done. We're just kind of polishing it. And we're also like, I think looking for like,
what is the opportune time? And like, I think I'm very thankful for like, arc doing their launch
because we learned a lot of lessons from that. But what would those like, you know, they had some
some things went well and there was some drama around it. And also, I think that the big question
is like, how do you launch and have like successful day one tokens that do really well and bring
like hype and, you know, like, how do you just not with the launch? So, you know, I appreciate them.
I say that in this space, they're probably our biggest, like competitor, so to speak,
although I like what they're doing or doing great or something. But definitely like, you know,
I'm like, wow, I'm really glad we didn't launch today. This is kind of my sentiment. I also think
a lot of it's not their fault. It's just like when you're trying to ship into a market where like,
volume is down real bad and sentiment is down real bad. It can just, it's just like not,
you know, it's not great. I had a friend who just launched a token like last week and was like,
I mean, you're almost better off just waiting a few weeks. I think it's going to get better.
But, you know, that's how it is. So yeah, it's time to get everything.
Timing is one of the, you know, but other way to look at it is also this that if you launch now,
when the sentiment is so bad, it's likely that, you know, the token trends in the right direction,
like after some time, whereas when you launch in the peak menu phase, the token kind of trends
downward after a while, and then you have to spend that time to revive things or whatever. Like,
I mean, take your pick. Like both have their advantages and drawbacks I feel.
There's definitely value in like, not being too far below your all time high.
Yeah. Yeah. 100%. So yeah, like, are there going to be like revenue streams dedicated towards
token or some sort of buybacks or whatever in the economics that you're planning?
Yeah, that's planned in the launch pad, for sure. We have like a token buyback as part of like,
what we'll be doing with our side of the fees. And we have some ways of like making sustainable
revenues that we continue to build the core tech. And that's like doing kind of like consulting
work for people to build agents, getting some sponsorships for the agent framework itself,
kind of like taking more of a foundation approach there. And then probably working with some of the
altos on some of the governance stuff. And there's some stuff that we'll announce around like
putting some of our useful agents into specific ecosystems and things. A lot of it right now is
like, can we just get it to the point where like we're paying for all of our, we're not burning
token, you know, like if we can get to the point where it's sustainable and we're making more than
we're spending on engineers and everything and we don't have to spend any of our token, then we're
already in like pretty good shape, I think. And then we'll have like a good platform to add more
value, cool mechanisms. We have some things like we're looking at liquid staking, you have like a
farm set up, we have some things that are like actually like technically ready to go. But I think
we want to make sure that the fundamentals to economically are there like, I think if we just
offered like staking of our token to earn more of our token right now, it wouldn't really be helping
our like by pressure situation that much. So we're, yeah, we're trying to do that thing. Also doing
some like rev share remiss of people where like our portion of the rev share goes to buying back
our token and stuff like that. No, I mean, definitely agree with the fact that staking your own token
to get more of that is, is not a good idea because end of the day, like it's laws of nature, like you
need something from outside to come into this ecosystem so that this remains steady or keeps
growing, like it's just like whatever the staking yield is that is going to create a self pressure
and necessarily more than what you already have, right? So it surely is a good idea that you are not,
you know, hinging on that to ensure that there is some sort of a by pressure or some offer to
staking off market. I have a strong sense that the thing that's going to win is going to be the
quality of the product. I'm pretty excited about what we're working on now. And I think that this
warm thing is like an interesting scalable thing. And I also think it has the ability to like,
it solves a lot of problems that people who have blockchains and dows and communities have
without like competing with them directly. Like, you know, I can just think of like 10 things we
can go solve for optimism and OP stack in their community and Dow governance structure like right
now. And I think that that would be a great value for us, a great value for them. And we're not
really like exclusive or competitive or we don't have our own chains. So like, I think we could
really work a lot deeper with a lot of the other chains, especially the people who are focused on
this governance stuff. And I think that we could, you know, both have like really deep partnerships
and like pretty continuous value accrual from people who are giving us tokens so we can like
swap them easily and you know, buy up our own token basically. Can you tell me one or two things
about what in Dow governance that you see are current gaps and that can be filled using what
you guys are doing? Oh, yeah. I mean, there's a lot of like low hanging fruit. I think that a
governance specific thing would be something like, I mean, people are very bad at like the
proposal process. I think it's kind of broken for one. I think that what I'd like to see is
automatic proposal generation and voting by the vast majority of people as well as like systems
to help people make better proposals and also like block bad proposals from getting through
the process. And basically just like things that weigh down like the human elements of these things
are having to like wade through a bunch of proposals, check like a discourse every day,
check a snapshot every day. And so I think there's a lot of opportunity to like just change how
voting works. I think that for a lot of things, we could probably reduce voting to like, I want
to vote for a model as opposed to I want to vote for every single proposal. Like, could I vote for
this model that takes all of my information, generally reflects how I feel about things and
then reflects that in a vote. And then if I like go through it and, you know, for anything controversial,
I can vote myself, but then generally like, you know, can I automate the process from both
voting as well as like decision making and input? I think the biggest problem that Dao's have is
probably like with flat hierarchy, you end up with like a lot of information going to a very small
number of people and like the vast majority of that being lost. So I think there's always like
a lot of different solutions to there that we could do with agents, like how do we collect
information, how we pull information from the social channels, select the important stuff,
identify signal, give it to the right people, help people in the community, just like figure
out where to route their information to or who to talk to about stuff. I think there's so many
things and so many of you will come into our community and are just like, like, where do I
get started? How do I participate? How do I help? And you know, all sometimes I'll see these and
they're like messages that I haven't been responding to in weeks. And it's like, it's like a hard
question. It requires a lot of time. And like, there should be an agent there kind of front
dooring them to the right places. I can think of a lot, like a lot, a lot of use cases. But generally,
I think that Dao's are lacking in this automation of these like basic things. And they're mostly
things just about like how people communicate information to each other or work or, you know,
or make sure that things are complete or funded or visible to the right people. Does that make sense?
Yeah, 100% because I'll tell you what governance tokens were new back in the day, right? 2020,
2021, like that was the time when every token that came out was a governance token.
What followed was, I think we had done this study a few months ago where we checked what is the
voting percentage across these major Dao's. I mean, you take Uniswap, you take anything, right? And
at best, these were at single digit percentages. So voter apathy is a real real problem for all
the governance tokens and all the Dao's. Maybe because, I mean, what you said is correct,
wading through that information is not easy unless and until you are on top of that project and
what is happening in the forum or on Discord because what happens on Twitter is really like
the tip of the iceberg. Most of the things probably happen on those governance forums and
Discords and you can really pay attention to five to 10 projects like on an ongoing basis, right?
I mean, you can probably take a look at several of them on a monthly or whatever. But if you were
to know every week what is happening in these projects, it's probably going to be like at best
too. I don't even know what's happening in my projects. Right. So that is a real problem. And
I'm really curious to see if AI can tackle that because then that truly means that we keep lapping
about how DeFi is for the people and, you know, like people will govern these things and whatever.
That has really not happened. But yeah, like I'm excited if that can be solved. So, yeah, I mean,
forward realistically, like, I don't think everything needs to be democratic. It just needs to be fair,
you know. And so it's like, how can we build these systems so that like, I don't have to vote
on everything. I just want to make sure that like my investment in this is represented and
reflected, you know, according to my values in some way. And if it's like an AI agent voting for
me 90% of the time, like, that's probably good. That's probably fine for me. And it's my agent,
like, you know, I can decide and plug it in however I want. I can give it whatever values I want.
I think that's probably better than that not voting at all. But I think the tools are probably
best used to help us like identify who is actually like an expert who's actually doing the work
and how do we reward them and like heat them contributing. I think this is a big problem that
Dao's have is like, it tends to be like, if you got in early, if you just like sit on your tokens
and let other people do all the work and you get money out of it. Right. Like that's kind of the,
you know, and it's like, we really have to balance between holders and contributors better. I think
that's a lot like Vitalik is obviously on this with deep funding. But I think that like, it's not
just the problem of how do you reward individual like projects or ecosystem or even contributors
to projects. But like, how do you make that sustainable and like build like, you know, like,
make this like an efficient way of operating basically, not just giving away money, but like
making it like a profitable or sustainable community operation. And there's a lot there. I think
agents could really help with all this stuff. But it is like a it's a ground game. It's an
agent by agent solution by solution. You know, it's not like we just get a model and suddenly
everything is easy. Like, it's a really hard collection of products to build. But I do think
there's a lot like now there's like enough where if you built like a really good community Dao
governance, whatever agent, like there's like a hundred thousand discords that would want that,
you know, there's like a lot of, you know, even like a game or guild might want it or like a remote
team might want it. Like the problems are basically the same. No, I mean, so what I can think of is
the real problem right now is I have no clue as to what is going on in all these projects.
Right. I mean, I don't even know there is a governance proposal up for whatever. Right.
Even for the tokens that the team polls or whatever. So if there is an agent that can really notify us,
whenever like, let's say that I'm interested in 20 projects and governance related to those
projects, if there's an agent that tells me that, okay, this is what is happening and gives me a
snapshot of or the download of what has happened recently and this is the vote and whatever.
I would definitely want to use that agent because that also keeps me updated about these projects
and helps me manage portfolio and whatever like this has ripple effects downstream for sure.
And like you said, right. If this sort of increases the voter percentage, even those would want
and the incentives that you share with mindless, you know, like there are people who click buttons
just because there will be some sort of an incentive if you vote, right. If you can share even some
portion of that with this agent, I think this is again like an opportunity that can make DeFi
slightly better if not like change it forever or whatever, you know.
Oh, yeah. I mean, basically, the optimal system here is the one where you just don't do what you
don't want to do. If you don't want to do something and you have an AI that can reliably do it in
your place, like that sounds great. You know, that sounds like like 95% of the things in my life.
I don't really, you know, I would totally automate. So then I would spend all the rest of the time
on the other 5% you know. So I definitely think that, yeah, I mean, that's the nature of the game
we're in. It's not just going to be DeFi. It's not just going to be governance. It's going to be
like everything is going to be like that. But it does take like shooting this like a product problem.
It's not a research problem anymore. We know the models work, but we need these products to actually
be like useful and good and like fit into our lives. You know, there's a reason you use like this
wallet over that wallet. And usually it's because of like small things that really do add up to
mattering a lot. 100% agree. There were things about, you know, I saw this on Twitter, someone
shared and I mean, this is not from crypto Twitter, but like regular AI dev, they were using two
different AIs to build a product. And it was only like, yeah, I was talking to another AI and
whatever. And there was no human involvement. And yeah, like, are these things real? Is it just
hot air? It's one of those things where it gets less likely to perform well as the project gets
more complex. But if you're doing a relatively simple project, you're like, hey, making me a
to-do list, make me a messaging app, you know, it can multiplayer messaging app. Sure. Like,
that sounds hard, but now it's like, it's probably what like five scripts, you know, some UIs and
backends and server state. It's really, it's like totally good enough at that kind of thing.
Generating the actual code is like the easy thing. It's more like navigating the state,
navigating the UI, putting the files in the right place, making sure that they save with all the
contents. Like, that's like the stuff that makes AI code, like agent, like self-coding kind of
challenging right now. But we're almost there. I would say it's totally doable. Like, my workflow
is heavily, heavily. Like, I'm like the open AI in that case. I'm just like, telling the agent
what I want. I write code, you know, I stream, like, sometimes I'll be like, cool, I'm driving
manual. I'll write all the code for this. And I always have to read it and be like, no,
it's not right. It doesn't smell right. You know, change the streams up. But I do spend a lot of
time just telling the AI to write its own code now. It's just so much faster. And you really,
you can't, it's not magical. Like, the ways that it will generate code for me, a lot of times are
like really bad. Like, okay, that works. But it's like five times more complicated and you duplicated
this and you like transform this and transform it back. It's like, you know, it's not always like
good code. And I would say that like it requires quite a lot of curation and like actually knowing
how to be a programmer, but damned if it doesn't make it like a lot faster. And it makes the whole
thing feel more like I'm like sculptor or an architect, like I'm working with clay. I'm like,
no, no, this isn't quite right. Do it this way. And you know, I'm like a director as opposed to like
individually typing out every single key. So from like a human perspective, like, it definitely
feels like it's there. It doesn't feel that far off that an agent could control another agent
and have that like happening. It's definitely not like human level yet, though. I don't know if
you saw the other good one that came out as a Claude Place Pokemon. Highly recommend that,
you know, and it's like doing an okay. It's just like, you know, it's doing okay, but it's not perfect.
And it's also like pretty slow, you know, there's still a lot of like, okay, you know, it's got it.
It's just from a human process. Like I'm definitely like 10 times faster than these agents are today.
But in five years, this is a done deal, man. Like there's not going to be, I'm not going to
program. I'm going to like specify the product that I want, you know, and almost like getting
in there to change the code is like a liability because I could be introducing bugs and
you know, like there is a, I definitely think we're headed toward that reality. And definitely,
like the AI is very good at coding. Like we all do use it a lot. It's not just a demo on Twitter.
I mean, the current state of things also reminds me that I was trying these DeFi apps, you know,
DeFi with AI applications, where you are talking to a chat bot and they are executing trades on
your behalf. They're certainly slower than someone like us who knows how to navigate these things.
Like, I mean, I know if that if I want to go from solar to base, like I need to use some sort of
a bridge and all of those things, right? And I know these things are fanned right now.
So it doesn't take too long, but interacting with that bot seems like more work at this stage.
And probably I mean, you know, like few months down the line, few quarters down the line,
this would change and it's really going to change like the way we trade or whatever. So
what do you think of that? Like have you played around with these apps or where are we?
My sense is like chat is really great for discovery. If I'm like, hey, how do I bridge my tokens to
base? And it's like, oh, well, here, click on this button to do it. That's so helpful, you know,
and I'm like, what is bridging? Like, oh, yeah, let me explain it to you. Boom. Like,
if you need me to link you, let me know. It's really great for like hiding a thousand buttons
underneath the chat interface. Like, right, like the chat, you don't need any buttons anymore.
It can just take you directly to the one button you want to press. I think that that like,
there's definitely a future there. But I think that people are really downplaying like how much
very small user experience, like UI UX design is really going to matter to this product. Like,
yeah, if it's recommending me the place to go and giving me the knowledge, that's pretty good.
If I'm just sitting there and I have to like send zero X, floor eight, you know, three,
seven, nine, eight, 0.1 ETH on arbitrum, it's like, is that objectively a better experience?
I don't think it is. I don't think I would use that. But I could imagine like, if you
refine it enough, and if it was coming in at the right places. And so it just comes down to like,
LLMs should not replace our apps. They like, they should be a tool in our tool belt for building
the perfect apps. I do think like, if you look at social behaviors right now, like a lot of traders
are starting to move on to like, Rick bot, tell a bull X, a lot of like, telegram based trading
and stuff like that is happening. So I think it makes a lot of sense that like, that we will
start to migrate this stuff to that form anyway. But it's less about like it being better than a
wallet interface and more about people just not wanting to leave telegram to do stuff.
Like, and so it's like, if we can even get parody with the user experience in that chat interface,
well, then we win on friction because now the user doesn't have to leave their favorite
website, their favorite app. You know, if I just sit on X and send you money or sit on telegram
and trade, like, I'm just going to do that. And so I think that's really where the value prop is
here. And I've been in tech a long time. And I remember like, the hype wave around augmented
reality and virtual reality 2016's like that. And it really felt like, you know, all these people
talking about how we're going to use it for this and that we're going to do online shopping and
e-commerce and virtual reality. And it's just like, if you actually had to step back, you know, like,
yeah, but is it actually a better experience? Like, do we like immersion or do we kind of like,
just like, casually scrolling our phones? Like, maybe VR is like an anti signal for like, having
to put a thing on your face. And I think that sometimes I think of the same, like, I want to
always make sure with agents that we're like, are people actually going to use this this way?
Like, is this just the LARP or is this like a hype thing that sounds good in my head, but
it's like practically not very good because of these like, just stupid externalities? Like,
AR is just not good because I have like a, you know, two pound thing on my face, like,
it doesn't really matter how good the quality of the image inside is. So we got to be really careful
with agents that like, we have a new hype technology, we're in a hype cycle. Clearly, AI is very
valuable and powerful and like, it is everything we said it is or will be, but that we can still be
too early. We can be on the wrong side of the adoption curve there. And also, like, just a lot
of this stuff is just not how people are actually going to use it. Like, we already have jetpacks,
you know, like, you can just go buy a jetpack. It's just fucking loud and it's hard to fly,
you know, and like, it's kind of dangerous. So like, are you going to use a jetpack to get to work?
No, I think that same thing, like any future tech, we should be very careful. Like, where is this fit
in? And I think Ellen's are great at like, extract every conversation from this discord and tell me
who helped somebody else and give them a point for every time they helped them. Like, that Ellen's
rock those kinds of tasks, right? But like, trade these coins or, you know, like, be the CEO of my
company, like, maybe not, maybe not so good at that kind of thing. And so I think there's like a
timing, a capability of what we can do today. And then also just like the UX, like, is this really
how I'm going to use this thing? And there's also some path guidance. Like, if, you know, like, most
of us do know how to use a wallet. And like, if you look at how people learn about crypto, a lot of
its word of mouth is on being like, all right, let me show you, like, let me open up metatast,
let me open up phantom, like, actually, like, show you how this works and what's going on. And so I
do think we can make the wallet experience better. But I don't think we should think we're just going
like, throw everything out and like, have chat now. That makes sense. Yeah, that's super helpful.
I think it's in line with what I was thinking when I use these ads. And like, no, that is too
clunky, right? No, I'm not going to use this. I tried them because I was curious about it,
but do we like continuously use them if this is how they are going to be?
No, like, yeah, I put the Apple vision pro on it was pretty cool. But I'm going to use this every
day. Like, no, it's just not a better experience, you know, 100%. Like, you've seen one cycle now,
what I mean, but that is you've seen the token price go up, you've seen the token price go down,
whatever, and pretty sure that there are lessons learned about whether it was managing team,
whether it was how to think through token, whether it was about timing. What were these lessons and
what would you do differently if, you know, you had to do it all over again?
I mean, I've learned a lot of lessons. The motivation to ask this question is I'm pretty
sure that there are a lot of founders who are in the situation that you were probably in like six
months ago before you started all this. So it's just for anybody who's listening so that, you know,
they can take something out of this and not make the same mistakes or make new ones.
And I think there's a lot of this, like, you build through the bare mentality, which is right.
But I think a lot of that is like you do that because you, like, have regret that you got distracted
by the bull, I guess. If I own experience, after this kind of blew up, I had this, like, you know,
what, I want to go like meet all these people. I want to actually, I don't even want to go do the
circuit or anything or, you know, go do all the conferences. I just want to, like, go meet developers
and want to, like, go and evangelize a bit. And I did do that. We went to China and Hong Kong,
North Korea, I mean, South Korea. Japan, thinking a lot about the buy a bit today, went to a lot of
those places, went to New York, went to DC. I almost was Davos, but I got sick and, you know,
whatever. It was like doing the circuit of things that were kind of seem like what people expected
of me. But I think that, like, overall, while it had a temporary, like, real impact on hype and
the valuation going up as high as it did, you know, people in China being like, oh, wow,
cool. I just met Shah, like, great. Boom times, bull market. Let's go. You know, I'm sure that
that had, like, you know, added some value to our chart. I think in the long term, it was kind of a
distraction. And the actual, like, value that we got out of doing anything other than just building
the product is probably not as high as just building the product. And I think that we are in
his face, like, if you're, especially if you're in, like, a hype tech space, the only way to meet
the moment of hype is probably just to build as hard as you fucking can and just, like, really
try to ship the next version and make everything better. And I think that that's, like, something
that is kind of a hard lesson is like, I've been, like, doing nothing but coding for the last few
weeks, trying to just catch up on the architecture side and make sure we have a good vision going
forward. But I wish maybe not gone and done the tour. And, like, I did a lot of, like, you know,
I hired people, kind of relied on them to lead things that a lot of that did not go as well
as I had helped with, like, hiring people and leading stuff. I hired someone to lead V2 and
they kind of just didn't install it out and didn't do the work. And then I hired somebody else to do
it. And then they got coached, hired by another team. And so then I just kind of had to be, like,
okay, well, then I just have to sit down and do this myself. I'm, like, be the CTO and CEO.
I can't really rely on anybody else to do, like, that technical work for me. And so I think that a
lot of founders will probably find themselves in the situation of, like, the hardest thing is sort
of the hire, does, like, to replace yourself. If you really know where everything is, like, how it all
works. And you have a clear vision. And also, I think there's just, like, this real pressure to,
like, a lot of people calling me and DMing me and wanting to do partnerships and wanting just get
on calls. How can we work together? And at first, I was, like, really excited. And I, like, promised
people a lot of things. And like, yeah, let's do this partnership. And then, like, it just started
to come to, like, man, I'm like, I got, like, 30 hours of calls and, like, calendar next week.
And, like, most of this is just, you know, people who are essentially, like, vampire attacking our hype
and, like, they don't really want anything other than to, like, get a Twitter announcement out of
it. And I just, like, I don't know, I kind of, like, started to realize, like, this industry has a
lot of people who are just, like, not really building anything, but are just trying to, like,
keep their token alive or keep their name on, you know, in the Twitter feed. And I just don't
really want to be one of those people. I don't really want to have that kind of project. I really,
really want to, like, build the future of this stuff and, like, be on the cutting edge of, like,
AI agents and how we can, like, build this form factor and stuff. And so, I definitely feel like
I'm doing, like, having, you know, great meetings and people are taking me out to dinner in Japan
and all this, like, cool, interesting, like, life-experienced stuff, but it's not really adding value to
what I really care about. And I felt pretty antsy, especially toward the end of the trip. And I
think that if I was, like, you know, that moment where you kind of blow up, it's probably the moment
where you actually want to just build harder and, like, not do the victory lap at all and just,
like, focus on shipping the next version, because, like, you know, it's going to catch up with you,
and there's going to be a lot of pressure to deliver. And, yeah, so that's, that's, that's
the biggest lesson, I think, that I've learned from this. And, you know, it's East Denver right
now, but I'm home in San Francisco, and it's 8 p.m. But I'm going to probably stream for, like,
another six hours tonight and just go hard. You know, this is my life now. It was, like,
coding and streaming, and so it helped us think it shipped. And I'd probably be done
and chilling a little more if, um, if I had just, like, kind of buckled down and stayed home. But,
you know, it went in both ways. I think we had a much bigger all-time high as a result of traveling
and evangelizing. But I think that maybe we would have done better through this by just, like,
having more of a slow cook and just, like, really focus on building and skipping all that stuff.
If that makes sense. Yeah, that's definitely helpful. Is there anything else in terms of lessons or
dual was whatever? Oh, I mean, like, the hardest thing about the space is incentive.
You know, I've seen people, I've had talented devs leave a project where I was offering them,
you know, I think the big problem is, like, when you start a startup, you're like, oh, cool. I got
30% of the equity, right? Great. Hell yeah. Here, it's like, okay, I joined a project. I got
0.1% of the equity. It's like, yeah, but that 0.1% is materially worth more than that 30% was.
And a lot of people, I think, have looked at our thing, and I've had devs who are like, oh,
these guys are at a billion, or two billion, or 300 million, or wherever we're at in that moment.
Like, well, I could definitely do like at least 10% this well, and I could have all of that money
for me. And then they go and launch, and they end up with like a, you know, one million market
cat coin nobody cares about. And they're like, locked to it. And they have this community, like,
asking, begging them to ask me for a retweet. And I mean, I've seen this like 50 times now,
you know, like, I say more than half of the team has gone off and shipped their own coins and stuff.
And so I think like, how do we incentivize people, how to really make them feel like they're part
of the team. I also like, I think the other problem with going out and being very like, okay,
maybe public, I'm going to be tweeting, or it'd be like going to the putting these events together,
like speaking, is that then I'm like kind of disconnected from my own team. You know,
if I'm like sitting there taking calls externally, that's like every hour I talk to somebody external,
someone is now not communicating with someone internal, and like organizing and planning.
And I think that we need to really value, especially in crypto, like how actually making great stuff
is really, really hard and requires like a lot of focus. And you can't just like tweet about it
and it happens that you can't just hire like a mid level once we aren't good at that. Like,
the actual cutting edge shit really requires like, you have to be the top of your game,
working your ass off, you know, it's like, Elon shit. If it's not, you're just like, not gonna win.
You know, I think a lot of the chains, you know, there's a lot of L ones that promise a lot in like
2020, 2021 that are still haven't delivered. They're like AI features. And it's because
they're just not working that much. Like, honestly, like, what are they doing? Well,
they're going to East Denver. They're going to events. You know, I don't want to be that guy.
I don't want to run that teeth. You know, thank you so much for saying this, because,
you know, even me, right? There's event happening in Bangalore. There is event happening in Mumbai.
I don't want to go like I want to be in front of my workstation and, you know, doing what I do.
So yeah, I mean, there were times when I was second guessing myself as to, you know,
I should be networking him or whatever. But, you know, deep down, I sort of knew that probably the
highest value you can create for yourself is by working. And maybe networking is just not my
cake or whatever. But yeah, like, I completely understand where you come from.
It's all a balance. If nobody knows who exists, then like, you can, you know,
right, that's not going to help you either. Right. Right. But yeah, but we all know, you know,
there's some people who really grind and are diligent. There's some people just go to every
event. And there's value in those people too. They can really help to like spread your thing.
And there are hundreds you want to work with those people. It's not like they're bad. It's just like,
it's just like as the CEO, I think that if you were a CEO of a thing, you probably should not
spend all of your time talking to like external partnerships and going and getting on stage,
you know, or you should minimize it. Make it worth it. Yeah. Obviously, yeah.
Hundreds to say. Thanks a lot, sir. Of course, I mean, I barely got through my list of things here,
but yeah, this was fun for sure. Thank you for spending time. Yeah.
No problem. Thanks for having me again.
